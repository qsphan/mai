   @ KernelSyms.sys_unlink, 384 bytes / 129 instructions (CodeSysUnlink.v),
   the LARGEST function in sysfile.c and the last one proven.  A THIRTY slot
   frame ([c.addi16sp sp,-240] at +0x00, [c.addi4spn s0,sp,240] at +0x06),
   carved -- numbering slots from the top, [pa_stk sp0 n] = sp0 - 8n:

     slot  1  (s0-8)    ra
     slot  2  (s0-16)   s0, the frame pointer (= the ENTRY sp)
     slot  3  (s0-24)   s1 = dp  -- saved LATE, at +0x1a
     slot  4  (s0-32)   s2 = ip  -- saved LATER, at +0x5c
     slot  5  (s0-40)   s3       -- saved LATER STILL, at +0x72
     slots 6..7         dead
     slots 7..8         [struct dirent de] -- writei's, [addi s3,s0,-64]
     slots 9..10        [char name[DIRSIZ]] -- [addi a1,s0,-80]
     slots 11..26       [char path[MAXPATH]] -- [addi a1,s0,-208]
     slot 27            [uint off] in its UPPER word, [s0-212]
     slots 28..29       [struct dirent de] -- isdirempty's, [addi a2,s0,-232]
     slot 30            dead (the frame's bottom)

   THE TWO [de] BUFFERS ARE DIFFERENT SLOTS, and that is not an accident of
   the carve: gcc INLINED isdirempty (see below), and the two [de]s have
   disjoint live ranges, so it gave each its own storage.

   [s3] is DUAL-USE -- isdirempty's loop counter [off] at +0x104..+0x128,
   then the address [&de] at +0x8a -- which is why it is saved before
   [ilock(ip)] and reloaded on every arm at or below the isdirempty test.

   THE THREE REGISTER SAVES ARE SHRINK-WRAPPED, SO THE FRAME CARVE IS
   ARM-DEPENDENT (sys_open's shape, not sys_link's): the prologue pushes
   only ra and s0; [c.sdsp s1,216] is at +0x1a, AFTER the [argstr < 0]
   branch, [c.sdsp s2,208] at +0x5c after BOTH namecmp guards, and
   [c.sdsp s3,200] at +0x72 after dirlookup succeeded.  Each exit restores
   exactly the subset its own path saved: ARM A (+0x170) restores nothing,
   ARM B (+0xe8) restores s1, the [bad:] tail (+0x166) restores s1, ARM D
   (+0x158) restores s2 then falls into [bad:], ARM E (+0x17a) restores s2
   and s3 then falls into [bad:], and the success tail (+0xda) restores all
   three.  Nothing about the two buffers reaches this contract: they are
   carved out of [stack_own] with [StackBytes.slotsn_bytes_own].

   ==== isdirempty HAS NO SYMBOL ========================================

   [grep -i isdirempty kernel-rocq/*.v] is EMPTY and [KernelSyms.v] names
   only [sys_unlink]: gcc folded the whole helper into
   sys_unlink+0x0f8..+0x12c.  So there is no [CodeIsdirempty.v], no
   contract, no coverage row and there never will be -- the loop is a BLOCK
   LEMMA inside [ProofSysUnlinkPure], and its invariant is a fact about that
   block.  Two consequences reach this interface:

   * THE LOOP SPENDS NO LOG BUDGET WHATEVER.  Its body is [readi], whose
     contract takes no [log_op], no [log_ctx] and no [γ : log_names] at all
     ([SpecReadi.v]'s "READI MODIFIES NOTHING" banner), so however many
     records the directory has, no arm's figure depends on its size.  That
     is what makes the whole ledger parameter-free in the directory.
   * ITS SHORT-READ ARM IS A PANIC.  [readi] is EXACT, so
     [!= sizeof(de)] is reachable only where 16 does not divide the
     directory's size; the arm needs no multiple-of-16 invariant, it is
     discharged against [SpecPanic] and never returns.

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT =====================================

   sys_unlink is the kernel's ONLY record-DELETING path, and the walk is
   where the fragment campaign's delete half is finally spent.  Three facts,
   because they are what the walk is:

   * THE ZEROING RELEASES A FRAGMENT.  [memset(&de,0,16)] then
     [writei(dp,0,&de,off,16)] at +0x8a..+0xa4 is the exact inverse of
     dirlink's append: [FsStateEra.ent_toks_unlink] fires CALLER-SIDE on the
     record [dirlookup] found and RELEASES one [FsStateLink.link_tok] at
     [ip], which the [ip->nlink--; iupdate(ip)] at +0xbe..+0xca then
     CONSUMES through [SpecIupdate.wp_iupdate_unlink].  Nothing else crosses
     this interface in either direction.
   * ITS HOME-LIVE PREMISE COMES FROM THE PAYLOAD, NOT FROM A GUARD.
     The release wants [di_nlink dp <> 0] of the HOME, and unlike
     create and namex sys_unlink has no [nlink == 0] re-check to walk.  What
     supplies it is [DirView.dir_orphan_clean] (fs-fragments-campaign.md,
     PASS 2): an ORPHANED directory's live records are exactly "." and "..",
     the two [namecmp] guards at +0x44 / +0x58 say the matched record is
     neither, and [dirlookup]'s found arm says the record is live -- so the
     home cannot be orphaned.  The clause is a property of THIS binary and
     of no earlier one: it was refuted by sys_link's unguarded [dirlink]
     until f60ff58 gave sys_link create's orphan re-check.
   * THE T_DIR ARM's [dp->nlink--] SPENDS THE CHILD's ".." FRAGMENT.  The
     only fragment of [dp]'s register in the system lives inside [ip]'s own
     [ent_toks], at the index of [ip]'s "..", and [DirView.dir_dots_ix]
     beside [FsStateEra.ent_toks_era_borrow_at] is what names it.  That clause is guarded on [T_DIR] AND [di_nlink ip <> 0], and
     the liveness is the kernel's own [if (ip->nlink < 1) panic] at +0x7c --
     walked before the zeroing, like the two namecmp refusals.  In exchange
     the clause HANDS BACK [2 <= dir_nrec (di_size ip)], so the isdirempty
     loop never has to establish a record count.

   ==== THE REFERENCE LEDGER CLOSES AT TWO ON EVERY ARM =================

   [iref_slots 2] goes in and comes back out unchanged.  TWO, not sys_link's
   three, and the difference is structural: sys_link runs its SECOND resolve
   with [ip] already held, while sys_unlink's ONE resolve runs holding
   nothing.  The peak is therefore [max(the walker's own two, dp + ip)] = 2.

   * nameiparent takes two units and hands ONE back on success (the second
     pays for [dp]);
   * [dirlookup]'s found arm produces [ip] out of the remaining unit and its
     not-found arm returns that unit unspent;
   * every arm releases what it made -- [iunlockput(dp)] at [bad:],
     [iunlockput(ip)] then [iunlockput(dp)] on the isdirempty refusal, both
     on the success arm -- and the argstr arm makes no reference at all.

   ==== THE LOG LEDGER IS THE SET FORM, AND THE ZEROING PAYS FOR THE TAIL =

   begin_op mints [LogInv.log_op g MAXOPBLOCKS] = ten units and end_op
   retires whatever is left, so nothing log-shaped crosses this interface.
   The whole ledger is machine-checked in [SysUnlinkBudget.v]; three facts
   about it, because they decide the contract's premises:

   * ONE WALK, AND IT RUNS FIRST.  Nothing is held while [nameiparent] runs,
     so the ledger below it is parameterised by ONE reported boolean and
     enters at nine or ten -- never sys_link's seven.  The COUNTED walker is
     hopeless here for sys_chdir's reason: [(L+1) * iput_units] demands
     twelve of the ten at a three-component path.
   * THE ZEROING PAYS FOR THE WHOLE TAIL.  [SpecWritei.wi16_post]'s
     MEMBERSHIP TRIO at [tot = 16] puts [IBLOCK dp] in the op's set, so both
     the T_DIR [iupdate(dp)] and the [iunlockput(dp)] behind it run
     CREDITED.  Only [ip]'s own flush is uncredited, and it has to be:
     [dirlookup] and the isdirempty loop are pure reads, so nothing logs
     [IBLOCK ip] before it.  Relaying [wi16_spend] ALONE busts the worst
     corner by one -- [SysUnlinkBudget.su_ok_busts_without_the_membership_trio].
   * NO CORRELATION CLAUSE IS NEEDED.  [su_ok_uncorrelated] closes the T_DIR
     arm at [crb = false] together with [w1 = true] -- the nine-unit,
     uncredited-bitmap corner [SysLinkBudget.sl_corr] exists to exclude --
     and [su_ok_corner_is_exact] says it lands there at EXACTLY
     [iput_units].

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   [eb = true] is nameiparent's premise, inherited verbatim.  The
   [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded anyway,
   uniformly with begin_op / ilock / writei / iupdate / iunlockput / end_op,
   and is [emp] there.

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function parks in every one of
   its ten distinct callees, so it may return on a hart other than the one
   it was called on.

   THE BITMAP IS NOT MONOTONE, in either direction: the zeroing [writei] can
   ALLOCATE (its contract cannot refute an allocating write even though the
   record it overwrites is inside the directory's existing size) and every
   [iunlockput] can FREE (itrunc, under a link-count-zero inode -- which is
   exactly what a successful unlink of the last link produces); the bitmap
   is an invariant, so the contract says nothing about it.

   DETERMINISM: none is claimed, and none is available.  Which of the six
   arms runs is a function of the FILE SYSTEM and of the user's path, and no
   caller of this contract knows any of that.  The postcondition is the
   honest disjunction on the returned a0.

   ==== ONE CONTRACT ====================================================

   [Module Type SYSUNLINK] is sys_unlink's only seal.  Its body is the
   whole-function FRAME below plus ONE caller INPUT ([unlink_au_pre], the
   atomic-update bundle) and ONE armed OUTPUT ([unlink_arms], keyed on the
   returned a0).  The landed return blanket [sys_unlink_ret] is a
   consequence of the arms ([unlink_arms_ret]) rather than a second
   conjunct, because the arms already split on the two words a0 can hold.
   There is no stable corollary and no parallel form.

   THERE IS ONE RETURN CONTINUATION, [sys_unlink_closer], and it takes the
   armed post [ARMS] where a blanket-only reading would put
   ⌜sys_unlink_ret⌝ -- which the arms imply.  It is named rather than
   spelled inline for optimization.md's reason ("Seal a whole-function
   proof's continuation"): inline it is fifteen rows, and a mid-walk dump
   of [Delta] measured it at 879 printed characters -- 7.5 % of the Iris
   context inside W3 and 13-15 % inside W5, at EVERY step of the walk, in
   every block lemma, plus one more copy inside each block's own seam
   continuation.  It stays TRANSPARENT on purpose (same section's rule 1):
   the tails apply it with [iApply ("Hcont" $! ...)], which unifies through
   a transparent constant and fails through an opaque one.  It is defined
   OUTSIDE any [Section] because it is a premise of the contract below and
   its rows are applied at the hart the caller picks.

   ==== WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IN =======================================

   [unlink_au_pre] is the one-shot bundle of this syscall's linearization
   instants, at the commit mask [appE]: the nameiparent PARENT-PREFIX walk
   premise ([FsAbsEraMknod.npar_walk_pre_era], reused verbatim -- it is
   nameiparent-generic) and [SysUnlinkDefs]'s four commits.  That file's
   header carries the delta's two-instant shape, [unl_pre]'s side
   conditions and why the pair reads as one delta anyway.

   ==== THE ARMS ========================================================

   ret 0  -- [unlink_post_ok]: the fetched path (existential and tied to
             nothing -- unlink still takes the [∀ pl] walk; exec, open and
             mknod carry theirs at the argument's own reading,
             [ArgPath.arg_path_of], and unlink will when a consumer needs
             it), the cursor [P Lp d] at the
             parent, [unl_pre] restated purely at instant 1 beside the
             caller's own receipts [Fent]/[Ftgt], the instant-2 target
             pin, the region bound on [t], and the two observation
             commits refunded (the found fact is subsumed by [unl_pre],
             so firing [Fex] would be a second receipt at an earlier
             instant).
   ret -1 -- [unlink_post_fail], residue returned per arm:
             (i)   nothing fs-visible happened (argstr failed): the
                   whole bundle back unspent;
             (ii)  the walk died at hop [k]: [npar_walk_dead_era]'s
                   refund shape, all four commits back;
             (iii) the walk delivered the parent ([P Lp d] back, both
                   delta commits back) and the transaction refused:
                   (a) THE NAME IS A DOT -- refused BY NAME, before any
                       lookup: a PURE fact about the fetched string
                       ([last (path_elems pl)] is [DOT] or [DOTDOT]),
                       both observation commits refunded (the kernel
                       looked at nothing abstract);
                   (b) GONE -- dirlookup ran and MISSED: the miss
                       observation [Fmiss] FIRED at the instant, with
                       the parent's row and the absent name stated
                       purely beside it;
                   (c) DIR NON-EMPTY -- dirlookup FOUND [t] and
                       isdirempty refuted emptiness: the found
                       observation [Fex] FIRED, at the instant where
                       BOTH locks are held, so the same [av] purely
                       carries the parent's row, the entry, the
                       target's dir row and its non-dots witness;
                   (d) no abstract observation to report -- the k = Lp
                       deaths (namex's type test and nlink guard at the
                       parent's own level, and "unlink of /"), with both
                       observation commits refunded.  -1 deliberately
                       does not say which arm (DETERMINISM: none).

   ==== NOTHING ABOUT DURABILITY =======================================

   No durable clause of any kind appears below (design/fs-syscall-specs.md
   section 5); the per-syscall certificates are [FsDurSyscall]'s and the
   composition is the consumer's.

(* There is no parallel statement for the walk, the commits or the arms,
   and no second proof against the code.  No stable corollary is sealed:
   unlink retags BOTH the parent and the target, so both would refuse a
   client pin; the stable reading arrives with the tree layer's
   exclusivity fact, where [delta_unlink_split] makes the two instants one
   delta. *)

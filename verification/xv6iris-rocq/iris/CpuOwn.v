(* CpuOwn.v -- ownership of THIS cpu's [struct cpu] plus the push/pop
   interrupt discipline, as ONE predicate.

   [cpu_own n eb p b] owns, for the ambient CpuId:
     - the per-cpu cells and the counting token [cpu_hart n eb p]
       (IntrDefs.v):
         cpus[cid].noff  ↦₄ n     -- the CELL IS the count level, so
                                     push/pop specs need no noff argument
                                     and no level-mirror premise;
         cpus[cid].intena         -- pinned to [eb] (the saved base enable
                                     state) while n ≥ 1; arbitrary at 0;
         cpus[cid].proc  ↦₈ p     -- the current-process field;
         [intr_count n eb]        -- the SIE ghost eighth + (at n ≥ 1,
                                     eb = true) the restore payload;

   NOTE ON THE (FORMER) [C] ARGUMENT.  This bundle used to carry a fourth
   argument [C], an arbitrary caller frame threaded alongside the cells --
   the context-slot payload for cpus[cid].context: [cpu_ctx_free] at boot
   and while the scheduler itself runs, or emp once a function does not
   need to say anything about it.  [C] added nothing [cpu_own] itself
   needed: at every call site it was either universally quantified and
   passed through unchanged (exactly what Iris's own frame rule already
   gives for free), or fixed to [emp] (an identity conjunct), or -- rarely,
   at a real crossing such as scheduler entry -- a genuine resource that is
   now simply held ALONGSIDE [cpu_own] as its own separating-conjunction
   partner ([cpu_ctx_free ∗ cpu_own ...]) rather than folded inside it.
   Removing the argument is not a weakening: [cpu_own n eb p b lks] here is
   definitionally what [cpu_own n eb p C b lks] used to be at [C := emp],
   and every site that needed something else now states that something
   else explicitly, beside this bundle, instead of inside it.

   THE [b] INDEX -- the SIE state of the ambient [sie_cap_gpr] this bundle
   travels beside.  At [b = true] the cells and the token are NOT here:
   they ride in [sie_arm]'s enabled arm (IntrDefs.v), because with
   interrupts enabled a trap can migrate the thread and only what a leaf's
   [wp_next] re-delivers survives the crossing.  What is left at [b = true]
   is the pure fact the arm's ghost agreement pins anyway ([n = 0] and
   [eb = true], [intr_count_get_on]).  push_off and pop_off are the two
   functions that move the payload across this seam.

   [cpu_own 0 false p false ∅] is constructible from raw boot resources
   (cells + the SIE eighth at '0') -- no trap handler, no stvec, no trap
   CSRs -- which is what makes push_off/pop_off (and the whole
   acquire/release cone above them) usable during early boot, where both
   are no-ops on SIE. *)

Proof.
  intros Heq. destruct b.
  - (* enabled: the payload is in [sie_arm], nothing here mentions the hart *)
    iIntros "H". iExact "H".
  - (* disabled: no trap was taken, so the hart did not move *)
    rewrite (_ : CID1 = CID0); [ iIntros "$" | exact (Heq (or_introl eq_refl)) ].
Qed.

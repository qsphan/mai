(* SpecIupdate.v -- the public interface of iupdate, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void iupdate(struct inode *ip) {
       struct buf *bp;
       struct dinode *dip;

       bp = bread(ip->dev, IBLOCK(ip->inum, sb));
       dip = (struct dinode * )bp->data + ip->inum % IPB;
       dip->type  = ip->type;
       dip->major = ip->major;
       dip->minor = ip->minor;
       dip->nlink = ip->nlink;
       dip->size  = ip->size;

     }

   126 bytes, 44 instructions, COMPLETELY STRAIGHT-LINE: no branches, no
   arms, no panic of its own.  It is the in-memory-inode -> logged-block
   flush, and its contract is correspondingly a single arm.

   THE CONTRACT (claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md, "iupdate -- the flush").
   Everything goes in and comes back out unchanged EXCEPT THE INUM'S OWN
   ON-DISK RECORD, which comes back at [dn] -- the in-memory inode.

   THE BLOCK PREMISE IS GONE (claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md, §11.3 and
   §12).  [fs_chalf] is per BLOCK and a dinode block holds SIXTEEN inodes,
   so a contract that takes the block's half for the duration of the call
   is unsatisfiable by two lock holders in the same block.  The inode
   REGION ([InodeRegion.v]) owns the halves instead and never lets them
   out; the caller holds the EXCLUSIVE per-inum fragment
   [dinode_at fsc_ireg inum dn0] plus the persistent [ireg_inv], and iupdate
   hands it back retagged at [dn].  The sixteen-dinode list [ds] is now
   proof-internal: iupdate learns it at its own bread, via
   [InodeRegion.ireg_read].

   [dn0] IS THE STALE ON-DISK RECORD AND NEED NOT EQUAL [dn].  An inode
   with unflushed changes is the normal caller -- that is what iupdate is
   for -- so nothing here ties the fragment's value to [inode_meta]'s.

   THE FIVE SCALARS AND THE THIRTEEN ADDRS COME FROM DIFFERENT RESOURCES.
   [inode_meta ip dn] owns ip->type/major/minor/nlink/size at [dn]'s scalar
   fields; ip->addrs[] is owned by [inode_map fsc_fs ip bm] and NOT a second
   time by [inode_meta], so the premise [di_addrs dn = bm_cells bm] is what
   ties the record's addrs field to the cells memmove actually copies.  See
   the note on [InodeInv.inode_meta] for why the record rather than five
   loose scalars.

   THE BUDGET IS SPEND-EXACTLY: [log_op γ (S u)] in, [log_op γ u] out.
   iupdate is straight-line and ALWAYS executes its one log_write, so unlike
   bmap it can promise this.  bmap's spend-AT-MOST form is forced only where
   a path can skip the spend -- [log_op] has no mover outside the log
   spinlock, so a function that might not spend cannot burn a surplus.

   TWO SLOT UNITS, in and back out.  bread's reference is held across
   log_write, which wants one of its own; brelse returns it.

   NO BLOCK RUN BEYOND THE INODE BLOCK'S.  iupdate establishes no
   injectivity -- it installs no block number anywhere.  Who owns an inode
   block is no longer deferred: the region does (see above).

   THE SUPERBLOCK FIELD rides as a plain fractional cell, the way
   SpecInitlog.v takes [sb + 20] for fsc_logst -- read once at +0x18 and
   handed straight back.  There is deliberately no superblock abstraction
   for one field.  Unlike initlog, [sb] is not an argument here: iupdate
   reads the GLOBAL, via [auipc a1,0x1d / lw a1,1850(a1)] resolving to
   [KernelSyms.sb + 0x18].

   iupdate SLEEPS (bread), so it threads the full running-process bundle
   exactly as SpecBmap.v / SpecBread.v do.  It enters and returns at
   noff 0. *)

     CLEAR the type or LEAVE IT ALONE, so that no-writer-retypes-an-
     allocated-inode is a theorem of the model rather than a claim about
     this tree's callers (§19.1(i)).  The premise travels through iupdate
     unchanged: [dn0] is the stale on-disk record and [dn] the one being
     flushed.  Every caller has it today -- iput's free path takes the LEFT

     sys_unlink's decrement is the one writer that does, and it goes
     through [InodeRegion.ireg_write_unlink_reg], which pays for the drop by
     consuming a fragment.  Travels exactly as [di_type_stable] does, and
     for the same reason: the record the REGION holds at iupdate's seam is

     the count by exactly one, and that one unit is what pays for the

     STATED AT THE MACHINE'S OWN WIDTH, AND THAT IS FORCED (fs-sysfile.md's
     twelfth stop).  The Z-level equation
     [bv_unsigned (di_nlink dn) = bv_unsigned (di_nlink dn0) + 1] is what
     the ledger needs, but NO CALLER CAN PROVE IT: the store is a
     sixteen-bit [++] ([lhu] / [addiw] / [sh]), it wraps at
     [bv_unsigned = 65535], and nothing outside [InodeRegion] bounds a link

     leaves that corner alive
     ([ProofCreateParts.cr_nlink_guard_leaves_the_wrap] is the witness).
     So the caller supplies the two facts its WALK has -- the value the
     [sh] commits, and the branch the guard gave it -- and the region
     derives the Z equation under (L4), where the bound is open.  Both are

  (* THE FREEZE-PIN PREMISE, IN ITS RULING A-prime FORM (iclaim-ledger.md
     §3.9; [InodeRegion.ireg_write_link_reg]'s row).  The record whose count
     this flush RAISES must not be mid-free -- a freeze is precisely the
     state whose whole purpose is to make this flush impossible -- and there
     are exactly two ways to show it is not.

     THE PURE ARM, "the record is already named", is RULING A's and it is
     free at mkdir's [dp->nlink++] (a live directory the caller has locked).
     RULING A priced the whole row at that arm; IIIc proved it FALSE at
     create's FRESH-CHILD mint ([ip->nlink = 1] at create+0xc4, whose
     pre-record's count is ZERO by [fresh_shape]) and unavailable at
     sys_link's [ip->nlink++] (xv6 has no [nlink == 0] guard there, and
     namei's licence was borrowed and returned at the iget).

     THE TOKEN ARM is A-prime's supply and it closes both.  A-custody puts
     the inum's [ifreeze_off] on the payload's custody path, so a caller
     holding the inode LOCKED is holding it: [SpecIlock]'s post hands it out
     and [SpecIunlock]'s precondition takes it back.  Both failing sites are
     inside their own critical section.

     BORROWED AND RETURNED: the mover only READS the freeze column through
     it, so it comes back in the postcondition below and the holder's
     ilock/iunlock pair is undisturbed.  The arm is a PARAMETER rather than
     a disjunction so that a caller which paid the token gets the TOKEN

     the point (the twelfth stop's ruling asked for the call).  The
     increment had to move to the machine's width because a caller cannot
     prove the Z equation of a count it does not bound; the DECREMENT has
     no such problem -- lowering never wraps in the reachable range, every
     caller reaches this contract having just written a KNOWN halfword
     (create's fail arm writes a literal zero at +0x146), and (L4) is
     preserved here for free because the new count is below one the
     invariant already bounded.  Matching the shapes would buy symmetry
     and cost the landed consumer a re-thread, so it is not done. *)

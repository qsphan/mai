(* ProofSleep.v -- the whole-function sconf-tier proof of sleep()
   (SpecSleep.v), as a functor over its callees' interfaces
   (myproc, acquire, sched, release).  See claude-notes/completed/yield-sched.md.

   sleep() is yield() WITH A GUARD:

     p = myproc(); acquire(&p->lock);
     if (p->chan != 0) { p->state = SLEEPING; sched(); }
     release(&p->lock);

   so the proof is ProofYield.v's, with the [c.li]/[c.sw]/[jal sched] run
   moved behind a [c.ld a5,32(s1)] + [c.beqz a5,+0x20] and duplicated on the
   arm that does park.  Everything else -- the 32-byte prologue, the myproc /
   acquire pair, the scheduler-swtch protocol threading (SchedCtx.v), the
   release and the epilogue -- is byte-for-byte yield's.

   THE TWO ARMS REJOIN AT +0x20, AND THEY REJOIN ON DIFFERENT HARTS.  The
   parking arm returns from sched() wherever some scheduler dispatched the
   process; the no-park arm never left this hart.  So the release at +0x22 and
   the epilogue behind it are proved ONCE, hart-generically, as [sleep_join]
   with its OWN [CID0] binder -- the tree's rejoining-arms shape (see
   claude-notes/completed/fileclose.md) -- and each arm applies it at its own
   hart, [(CID0 := CIDs)] on the park arm and [(CID0 := CIDa)] on the no-park
   one.  THE JOIN PREDICATE DOES NOT MENTION WHICH ARM RAN: both arrive
   holding p->lock with [p->state] at RUNNING (the no-park arm never wrote it;
   the park arm was dispatched back to RUNNING) and with the whole
   proc-side bundle -- [proc_held ... RUNNING ch], the raw context cells, the
   hart tag and this hart's parked scheduler record.

   THE EXPLICIT-CPUID SHAPE.  sleep's contract is [wp_next true pj ...] -- the
   crossing index of a parking function is the literal [true] -- while its
   RESOURCE index is [eb] up to the acquire and the literal [false] from
   there to the release, where the held lock pins the hart and every leaf
   collapses via [wp_next_off].  sleep's own [wp_next] obligation is
   dischargeable at ANY hart: at index [true] the only pinning condition left
   is [pj = zero_reg], which [SchedCtx.proc_addr_nonzero] refutes, so
   [WpNext.wp_next_retarget] moves it to whichever hart the arm ended on.

   THE PARKED SCHEDULER RECORD LIVES IN THE RUNNING PROC'S OWN LOCK.  sleep
   holds that lock already (it is about to read [p->chan]), so it takes the
   record straight out of [proc_slots]' RUNNING arm -- no invariant, no fancy
   update, no receipt.  [SchedCtx.proc_slots_running] is the take-out: the
   thread presents the HART TAG half it carries inside [IntrDefs.cpu_claim],
   which both refutes every non-RUNNING arm and collapses the arm's
   existential hart to this one, and gets back the whole tag, the raw context
   cells and this hart's parked record.  On the park arm all three cross the
   swtch and come back at the RESUMING hart; on the no-park arm they never
   move.  Either way [proc_slots_running_intro] puts them back into the lock
   the release gives up.

   THERE IS NO SECOND LEMMA.  [wp_sleep_nested] walked the same code at
   noff = [S n] -- a thread already holding a spinlock -- and its park arm
   reached sched() at [S (S n)], where sched panics ("sched locks").  It has
   no clients since iput moved to the non-blocking acquiresleep, and it was
   the last thing standing on [SpecSched.wp_sched_locks], so both are
   deleted.  Sleep is entered at [cpu_own 0] and nowhere else, which is what
   makes that panic unreachable rather than merely permitted. *)

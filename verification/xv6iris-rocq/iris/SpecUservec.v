(* SpecUservec.v -- the public interface of uservec (trampoline.S), stated
   independently of its proof.

   uservec is the kernel's stvec handler for traps OUT OF USER MODE: it
   begins executing at virtual address TRAMPOLINE (= stvec's direct base)
   with the USER page table still installed, saves the 31 user registers
   into the TRAPFRAME page (through the user table's trapframe leaf),
   loads the kernel sp / hartid / usertrap pointer / kernel satp from the
   trapframe's kernel words, switches satp to the KERNEL table (the pt2
   window, roles swapped relative to userret), and jalr's to usertrap with
   ra pointing at userret (uva 0x9c).

   THIS SPEC CHAINS THROUGH usertrap AND userret DIRECTLY, the way any
   function-calls-function edge in this project works: uservec's own proof
   depends on USERTRAP's and USERRET's spec modules and invokes their WPs
   at its own call sites (ProofUservec.v becomes a functor over both).

   ==== THE PRECONDITION IS THE *BARE* RESIDUE, AND THAT IS THE POINT ====

   uservec IS THE VIEW CHANGE.  The user address space -- the page-table
   tree, the data pages, and satp/tlb -- is ONE resource that the kernel
   holds parked ([ProcPtOwn.proc_pt], inside [ProcInv.proc_priv], inside
   [usertrap_res]) while the kernel runs, and that
   [UserPtTree.user_pt_inv] holds installed while user code runs.  A spec
   naming BOTH is claiming it twice, so its precondition is unsatisfiable
   and the lemma is vacuous -- green, and applicable by nobody.  An earlier
   draft of this file did exactly that and "proved" the 44-instruction walk
   through it; see claude-notes/projects/uservec.md.

   So this spec takes [SpecUsertrap.usertrap_res_bare pt vksp]: the kernel
   residue with NO address space in it.  The two borrows close in one order
   around the call into usertrap and reopen in the mirror order before
   userret --

     bare --[_pt_close]--> parked --[_tlb_close]--> usertrap_res

   -- and both pieces are produced by the ONE instruction that changes the
   view, the [csrw satp] of the exit switch: it converts the user table
   from [utlb_inv_pt] back to a [pt_frame] and roots satp at the kernel
   table.  The user PAGES do not move at all; [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt_own_udata]
   is the whole of that conversion.

   THE TRAPFRAME PAGE IS NOT PART OF THIS, and that is why the walks work.
   [ProcInv.tf_page] is at the PHYSICAL tier (native [tf_pa]/[↦ₚ₈] cells --
   the SAME tier uservec/userret's own 44/31-instruction walks use, so no
   phys<->mem crossing at this boundary) and its leaf has U = 0, so user
   mode cannot reach it and [user_pt_inv] never claims it.  It stays in the
   BARE residue, available in exactly the window the address space is not,
   which is why [usertrap_res_tf_open] is stated there: the proof opens it
   for the SAVE walk's cells, reseals before calling usertrap, and repeats
   the open/reseal around the call into userret.

   [uservec_post] therefore is NOT userret's own exit shape (which exposes
   raw [tf_pa] cells) -- it is that shape with the trapframe folded back
   into a fresh bare residue and the address space handed back in the USER
   view.  Folding THAT into the user-mode loop (the outer Löb that
   discharges [UserExec.stvec_handler_wp]) is future work, once USER is
   folded in too; the [Rut] it will need is
   [fun p => ∃ ksp, usertrap_res_bare p ksp].

   THE TWO GAPS THIS CONTRACT USED TO TAKE AS PREMISES, AND NO LONGER DOES
   (2026-08-21).  [user_trap_frame]'s pure content used to be only
   [trap_mstatus_ok ms_v], and nothing tied the trapframe's four kernel
   words to a root / [KernelSyms.usertrap] / [cid_word]; so this spec took
   "trap_mstatus_ok -> sconf_ms_facts /\ SPIE = 1" and "every 36-word list
   is tf_kernel_words_ok" as bare premises.  BOTH WERE UNSATISFIABLE (see
   claude-notes/projects/forkret-park.md §4), which made everything above
   uservec vacuous.  Now:

   * [UserExec.trap_mstatus_ok] carries FS/VS/XS/SD/MPP and SPIE = 1 --
     the user tier never writes mstatus, so it preserves from userret's sret
     what [user_mstatus_ok] now records -- and
     [SpecUsertrap.usertrap_entry_ms_of_trap] derives the rest;
   * the residue carries [UsertrapRes.ut_tfk]: the four kernel words are
     [ProcGeom.tf_kernel_words_ok] at an existential root whose [kpt_inv]
     rides beside the fact.  prepare_return establishes it at the hart the
     process resumes on (usertrap's exit and forkret's tail seal it), and
     the openers hand it back -- which is also where the proof gets the
     kernel root it switches to, so this contract names no [kroot]. *)

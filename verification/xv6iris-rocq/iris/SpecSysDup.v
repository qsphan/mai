(* SpecSysDup.v -- the public interface of sys_dup(), stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     uint64 sys_dup(void) {
       struct file *f; int fd;
       if (argfd(0, 0, &f) < 0) return -1;
       if ((fd = fdalloc(f)) < 0) return -1;
       filedup(f);
       return fd;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.sys_dup = 0x80004bd6, 24 instructions (a 48-byte frame; the
   [struct file *f] local lives at s0-40, [f] rides in the callee-saved s1 and
   the descriptor in s2 across the filedup call).  Decode: CodeSysDup.v.

   THE WINDOW, AND WHY IT IS THE INTERESTING PART.  [fdalloc] stores the
   pointer BEFORE [filedup] bumps the count, so between the two calls two
   descriptors name one [struct file] and only one reference exists.  That is
   not a soundness problem -- the fd table is thread-local, so no other core
   can observe it -- but nothing in [ProcInv.proc_priv] can STATE it: the
   destination's cell names a file and [ofile_slot] then demands a reference
   that is not there.

   Worse, the reference [filedup] needs in hand is the SOURCE descriptor's, so
   that descriptor is payloadless too -- and it must stay that way ACROSS the
   fdalloc call, which itself wants the descriptor array.  A borrow with
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_ofile] cannot span the call (its wand demands the whole
   slot back first), which is exactly why the block is split at the fd table
   and the deficit tracked in [ProcInv.proc_ofiles_owe].  sys_dup is the
   function that forced that design; see claude-notes/design/file-table.md.

   THE LEDGER BALANCES WITH ZERO ALLOWANCE, and that is worth stating: the
   [fd_slot] fdalloc releases when it fills the destination descriptor is
   exactly the one [filedup] consumes to pay for the higher count.  So sys_dup
   needs none of the process's [FdSlots.FDSPARE] units -- unlike sys_open (one)
   or sys_pipe (two), which hold references in locals before installing them.
   The fd-slot conservation law never even wobbles here.

   DETERMINISM.  Which of the three exits runs is a function of the syscall
   argument and the process's own descriptor array, both of which the caller
   knows, so the postcondition says so ([SpecArgfd.arg_fd] and
   [SpecFdalloc.fd_frees]) rather than offering an unconstrained "duplicated
   it, or didn't": a kernel that always returned -1 would not satisfy this
   spec.  And the descriptor sys_dup returns is the LEAST free one, naming the
   very pointer the source held.

   THE FRACTION IS NOT OBSERVABLE, deliberately.  filedup halves the source's
   [file_ref] fraction, but [ofile_slot] existentially quantifies it, so the
   postcondition never mentions [q] -- which is what lets sys_dup be called any
   number of times without the spec accumulating halvings.

   ==== ONE CONTRACT ===================================================

   [Module Type SYSDUP] is sys_dup's only seal and [sys_dup_post] its only
   reading.  A caller that knows the row of the descriptor argument 0 names
   reads the post SHARPENED -- the bad-fd arm refuted by its own premise, the
   destination's new row spelled [FdOpen rb wb t] rather than [sts !!! fd0],
   the source pointer [fv] named rather than existential -- and that reading
   is the DERIVED [sys_dup_post_sharp], never a second contract against the
   code.  The premise-free post is what the seal states because it is what
   the DISPATCHER can call: a user's argument 0 may name no open descriptor
   at all, so a contract premised on [arg_fd ... = Some _] would cover only
   part of the syscall.  Nothing about dup is atomic in the file-system
   sense -- there is no bundle to hand in -- so the descriptor row IS the
   whole client-facing content.

   THE DRIVING CONSUMER is xv6's init.c: [dup(0); dup(0);] right after
   [open("console", O_RDWR)] returned fd 0.  After the two calls fds 0, 1 and
   2 all name the SAME open file description -- the console -- which is what
   makes the shell's stdin/stdout/stderr three names for one [struct file].
   Each call runs at [fd_frees]'s head (1, then 2) and returns the bundle
   with the new row at the source's state.

   ==== THE SAME OPEN FILE DESCRIPTION, AND WHERE IT IS SAID ===========

   After a successful dup, [fd0] and [fd1] name one [struct file] -- one open
   file description, hence a shared offset.  Each half of that sentence has
   its own home:

   - AT THE ARRAY ([pv_ofile], the sharp fact): the success arm's block is
     [proc_priv ... (us_ofile U fd1 fv)] with [fv] the pointer [arg_fd] read
     out of the SOURCE cell, so the destination cell now holds the very word
     the source cell holds.  [dup_same_cell] below spells it as the two
     lookups.
   - AT THE GHOST LEVEL (the client-visible echo): both rows of the returned
     bundle read the source's state ([dup_rows_both]).  Stated honestly, an
     EQUAL [fdstate] does not by itself pin an equal file description -- two
     separate opens of one inum have equal states too -- so the fdstate-level
     fact is the echo and the [fv] cell tie above is the identity.
   - THE SHARED OFFSET has no client-facing carrier: [f->off] lives in
     [fcontent] behind [file_ref].  Its consumer is landed all the same --
     the write chain's per-chunk EXISTENTIAL offset is priced exactly on the
     struct file being shared (dup, fork), and dup is the syscall that makes
     that sharing real.

   ==== WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY ==============================

   NO REFCOUNT: filedup's [f->ref++] is internal bookkeeping, swallowed by
   [ofile_slot]'s existential fraction on both ends (THE FRACTION IS NOT
   OBSERVABLE, above).  NOTHING ABOUT fs STATE: dup reads and writes no
   inode, no directory, no byte, so there is no instant to linearize and no
   observation to fire.  NOTHING ABOUT USER MEMORY: dup copies none, and the
   continuation accordingly binds no [M']/[P'] -- contrast the read and write
   frames.  NO STABLE COROLLARY: there is nothing to stabilize, since no
   commit closure exists whose receipts a share could pin. *)

     the third spends it: duplicating opens a NEW descriptor, so that
     descriptor's authority has to move from [FdClosed] to the source file's
     type ([ProcInv.proc_priv_settle]).  The SOURCE descriptor's state does
     not change and its authority round-trips through the loan, which is why
     one bundle access is enough for a two-descriptor syscall. *)
  (* THE TABLE IS NAMED, and the three arms differ in exactly one row.  The
     two failure arms hand [sts] back untouched; the success arm hands back
     [<[fd1 := sts !!! fd0]> sts] -- the DESTINATION becomes a COPY of the
     SOURCE, which is what dup means at this level: filedup only bumps
     [f->ref], so the two descriptors name one [struct file] and therefore
     have one state.  The source row is unchanged, and [list_insert] says
     every other row is too.  This is [UsysMemOk.usys_fd_ok]'s dup row.

     [sts !!! fd0] RATHER THAN A PREMISE naming the source's state: the
     total lookup needs nothing of the caller and it is the form the
     syscall table already uses, so the two compose without a translation
     step -- and it is what keeps the post callable where the caller knows
     nothing about the descriptor, which is every dispatch.  A caller that
     DOES know the row reads the premise form off [sys_dup_post_sharp].

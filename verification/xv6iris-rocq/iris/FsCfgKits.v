  (*  Consumed by [IcacheBoot.icache_boot_at] (after iinit, main+0x92),
      [BioInitAt.bio_init_at] (on binit's post, main+0x8e) and the four
      [WpLockAt.newlock_at]s (kmem / virtio_disk / itable / pr) that
      [ProofMain.mn_grp_fs] runs between +0x8e and +0xa2.  ONE opaque
      definition at the ambient names, [FsReady.fs_ready]'s own argument
      applied to the boot side; open it with [fs_kit_icache_open].

      *** WHAT (d2b) MUST ADJOIN, AND FROM WHERE ***  Every row below is a
      GHOST row, because [fs_cfg_alloc] holds no memory at all.  The
      PHYSICAL halves of the same three constructors join at the assembly
      site, and none of them can come from here:

        (P1) [icache_boot_at]'s five physical premises -- [itable_lock ↦₄ 0],
             [lock_name itable_lock "itable"], [lock_cpu itable_lock ↦₈ 0],
             the fifty [SleepLock.sl_fresh (i_lock (ientry k)) "inode"] and
             the fifty [IcacheInv.ientry_raw k].  Producer:
             [BootShared.boot_bss_carve]'s .bss rows plus iinit's own
             postcondition (the [sl_fresh]es exist only after [iinit] runs,
             fs-cfg-boot.md "What must NOT move here").
        (P2) [bio_init_at]'s physical premises -- [bcache_addr ↦₄ 0], its
             name and cpu cells, the thirty [sl_fresh (buf_lock (era_node k))]
             and the thirty zeroed [struct buf] rows, and
             [BcacheInv.bcache_lru bhead (blist 0 NBUF)].  Producer: binit's
             postcondition + [boot_bss_carve].
        (P3) each [newlock_at]'s three cells ([lk ↦₄ 0], [lock_name lk s],
             [lock_cpu lk ↦₈ 0]) and its RESOURCE: [KallocInv.kmem_res] for
             kmem (kinit's post), [DiskInv.disk_res] for virtio_disk
             ([SpecMainSecondary]'s [disk_res_boot], already at
             ProofMain.v:1346-1351), [SpecPrintk.pr_res] for pr.
        (P4) [IrefSlots.iref_slots_auth] and [iref_slots IREFSLOTS] -- NOT
             minted here: their home is [IrefSlots.iref_slots_alloc], run
             inside [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc] beside the [irefslotG]
             instance it returns.  [icache_boot_at] wants the auth; fsinit
             wants one [iref_slot] unit.  Adjoin both from the existing
             boot-shared row.

      The three PERSISTENT products of these constructors ([bio_ctx],
      [is_itable2], [itable_inv], [ic_escrows], [ic_sleeplocks], the three
      locks) go on to [SpecMainSecondary.main_deposit], not into a kit.   *)

      widening [FirstTok.first_tok]'s left disjunct (fs-cfg-boot.md
      "Transport to forkret's first arm"); the name says GHOST so the split
      against the physical rows is explicit at the call site.

      *** WHAT (d2b) MUST ADJOIN, AND FROM WHERE ***

        (A) THE RAW CELLS fsinit and initlog write: the 32 [.bss] bytes at
            [&sb] ([∗ list] i ∈ seq 0 32, pa_add sb_base i ↦ₘ _), and
            [log_addr ↦₄ _], [lock_name_field log_addr], [lock_cpu log_addr],
            [l_start], [l_dev], [l_out], [l_cmt], [l_ncommit], [lh_n_pa],
            the thirty [lh_block i].  Producer:
            [BootShared.boot_bss_carve] / [boot_shared_alloc]'s globals row.
        (B) [LogDefs.log_mirror_born].  Producer:
            [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc] -- it is the ERA's mirror
            variable ([RiscvPtsto.mirror_name] = [era_mirror_name
            riscv_eraGS]), which [RiscvAdequacy] mints at power-on AT THE
            PICTURE OF THE DISK THE ERA BOOTS ON and whose other half its
            custody hook puts straight into [FsCrash.P_fs] (durable-disk
            1a), so this fupd cannot mint it and must not try to.
        (C) [IrefSlots.iref_slot] (one unit, for ireclaim's iget/iput pair)
            and [BioDefs.bslots 35].  Producers: the boot-shared
            [iref_slots IREFSLOTS] row, and [bio_init_at]'s POSTCONDITION
            ([bslots BSLOTS_FS] is produced at main+0x8e, not at the era) --
            so the [bslots] must be carried from kit 1's consumption site.
        (D) PAID, and it is a row below rather than an owed one:
            [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], allocated in the era fupd from
            [BitmapInv.bitmap_res] at [used := FsImg.fs_bmap_set BSIZE
            (P fsc_bmapstart)], the bitmap block's OWN bit set.  Built by
            [bitmap_res_of_image] out of the coverage remainder, which is
            why [fs_kit_spent] now names [fs_bitmap_spent] (the bitmap
            block plus the whole free pool) -- those leave the remainder
            and enter the invariant.  Taking [used] to be the block's own
            bits is what makes the byte-level equation
            [P bmapstart = bitmap_bytes used] a THEOREM
            ([FsImg.bm_bytes_fs_bmap_set]) rather than a new image sweep.
        (E) [FsCrash.fs_crash_seam] and [RiscvPtsto.gen_cert] are
            PERSISTENT and reach fsinit through [main_deposit], not a kit.

      [ireg_inv] is persistent and also travels via [main_deposit]; it is

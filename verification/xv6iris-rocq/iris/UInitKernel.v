  (* ...AND THE ERA'S TURN RIDES THE SAME SLOT (lane CONS-IO milestone F).
     The bundle has ONE linear slot and the turn is the third thing the boot
     hands <init>: it is the APPLICATION's per-era credential, minted at the
     power-on step, carried through [App.Hinit_boot], and spent by the
     application's own ledger at init's first verified write.  Beside the
     console lease rather than in [UkRun.urun]'s boot row, because it is
     exactly as era-local as the lease is; an opaque [iProp] threaded the
     way [T] is. *)
  (* ...AND THE CREDENTIAL THE BANNER HANDS ON (lane IO-LEAF, M4a(2), step
     3; M6b) is [(cc_wp Cr) n], a family: what the payment's last byte leaves behind at
     line boundary [n] is the APPLICATION's to say, and this tier cannot
     name it. *)
  (* ...AND ITS THIRD CONJUNCT (lane IO-LEAF, M5) is the application's own
     per-position READ credential at 0 -- the [(cc_rd Cr)] half of the console
     lease's payload ([UkInit.init_rd (cc_rd Cr) (cc_wbn Cr)]), which the shell gets at
     every fork and gives back at every reap.  For the echo era it is
     [EchoOut.eturn]'s own [dl_cnt v (1/2) 0], which is why it arrives here
     on the SAME boot resource as the turn.  ITS FOURTH (step 3) is the
     write half of the same turn: the banner-owed credential at 0, [(cc_wbn Cr) 0],
     which the pair carries beside the read half and every later round
     gets back from the shell it reaped. *)

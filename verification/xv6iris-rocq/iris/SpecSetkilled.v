(* SpecSetkilled.v -- the public interface of setkilled(), stated
   independently of its proof.

     void setkilled(struct proc *p) {
       acquire(&p->lock);
       p->killed = 1;
       release(&p->lock);
     }

   @ KernelSyms.setkilled = 0x8000211e, sixteen instructions: a 32-byte
   ra/s0/s1 frame (slot 0 is padding), [c.mv s1,a0] to park [p] across the
   two calls, acquire, [c.li a5,1] + [c.sw a5,40(s1)] (p->killed = 1),
   [c.mv a0,s1], release.

   THE POINT, and the reason the postcondition is EMPTY.  [p_killed] lives
   in [SchedCtx.proc_pub], at the TOP LEVEL of [proc_lock_res] -- but
   [proc_pub] quantifies the flag EXISTENTIALLY, so the invariant says
   nothing about its value and there is nothing for a caller to learn.
   setkilled is therefore the mirror image of killed(): killed() reads a
   value the contract cannot constrain, setkilled writes one the contract
   need not report.  Both reach the cell by opening the lock and destructing
   one existential, and neither ever learns the process's state or touches
   either [proc_slots] guard -- which is exactly what the invariant's
   always-resident row is for.

   (The postcondition is not quite empty any more: the caller's quarter of
   [p->pid] is LENT to the call and handed back.  It says nothing about the
   write -- it is what shows the slot being written is LIVE; see the
   premise's note, lane SELF-KILL 4b'.)

   Making the write visible would mean giving [p->killed] a fraction that
   travels with the running thread (the [pid] discipline), and no consumer
   wants one: the only reader is killed(), which any hart may call on any
   proc.  See claude-notes/design/proc-struct.md, discipline 1.

   The panic credentials are threaded because acquire takes them (its
   "acquire" panic on a doubly-held lock). *)

     this function is one of the two writers, so it cannot re-bundle the

         caller is usertrap's fault arm on [myproc()], so a process that
         faults ON PURPOSE pays for its own death with no taint at all.

     holds, which its own trap deposit pays, so the row it founds is the
     SPENT one -- marker in, payload kept (it comes back below, for the
     kexit two critical sections later).  The taint's side founds the paid
     arm as any third-party killer does. *)
  (* KEYED on which party pays ([self]), so the post can say which side it

   one it is [boot_facts]' own RAM totality clause.  Carrying it in a ghost

  (* A request's lifecycle is a sequence of SEPARATE memory events
     (VirtioModel section 6): the POP reads the ring entry; the FETCH reads
     the descriptor chain and the header; a write's payload is READ at the
     capture; then the device WRITES the data buffer (for a read), the status
     byte, the used-ring element -- one [DiskStepWrite] each -- and finally
     the used index ([DiskStepComplete]).  So a hart, and the memory model,
     see every intermediate state: the index bump a driver waits for is
     ordered last because it IS last, not because a single transition put it
     there.  Which in-flight request each step advances is the device's
     choice ([h]): it serves what it has popped in whatever order it
     finishes (tools/vtest/README.md finding 5).

     THE POP: the device takes the next available-ring entry.  This is the
     phase that is STRICTLY IN ORDER -- QEMU's [virtqueue_pop] increments
     [last_avail_idx] by one -- and it is what xv6's reuse of
     [avail->ring[idx % NUM]] depends on: the entry the driver overwrites
     belonged to a position the device is provably past.

     The disk masters the bus.  It does not read the byte MAP -- it reads a
     total VIEW of the bus that agrees with the map wherever the map is
     defined and is UNCONSTRAINED everywhere else (VirtioModel section 4),
     and the view is quantified here, existentially.  So a DMA read of an
     address nobody has accounted for returns an arbitrary byte, which is
     what a real bus does, and what forces a driver proof to account for
     every address it hands the device.  The three READING arms -- pop,
     fetch, capture -- all take such a view; nothing after the fetch reads
     the bus again. *)

     carries no memory view at all.  WHEN the request may complete relative

(* THE LOADED IMAGE.  The ELF's loadable bytes -- text ([kernel_bytes]) and
   data ([kernel_data]) -- RESTRICTED to the file image [ram_lo, img_end).
   The restriction is what makes ".bss is zero-filled" a SYMBOLIC fact: at
   or above [img_end] the filter yields [None], so [boot_byte] is [byte0]
   with no lookup into either 20k-entry literal.  [img_end] is the single
   PT_LOAD's vaddr + filesz, and [.bss] runs from there up to
   [KernelData.kernelMemEnd].

   IT IS COMPUTED FROM THE DUMP, not transcribed from it: the dumper already
   emits the program headers as [KernelData.kernel_segments], so a literal
   here was pure duplication -- and a stale one surfaced as an unhelpful
   [lia] "Cannot find witness" deep inside BootCarve.v rather than at this
   line.  The [ltac:(eval vm_compute)] form is durable-notes.md's "compute
   the result ONCE into its own Definition" idiom: the body is a plain [Z]
   literal by the time anything downstream sees it, so [unfold img_end; lia]
   reduces exactly as it did before. *)
Definition img_end : Z :=
  ltac:(let x := eval vm_compute in

           | [] => 0%Z
           end) in exact x).

(* THE READ-ONLY/WRITABLE BOUNDARY inside the loaded image -- one past the
   last byte the kernel can never store to.  The PT_LOAD [img_end] is built
   from is a SINGLE RWX segment, so it says nothing about this; only the
   ELF's SECTION flags do, and [KernelData.kernelRodataEnd] is the dumper's
   reading of them (the lowest writable allocated section's address).  So the
   image splits THREE ways, not two:

     [ram_lo, rodata_end)   .text / .rodata / .eh_frame -- read-only image
                            material, immutable for the life of the image;
     [rodata_end, img_end)  .data / .got / .got.plt -- INITIALIZED but
                            WRITABLE (xv6's `first` and `nextpid` live here);
     [img_end, kernelMemEnd)  .bss -- zero-filled and writable.

   Only the first range may be resided at [DfracDiscarded]: a persistent
   points-to at an address the kernel stores to is an INCONSISTENT premise,
   not a failed proof, and it makes every contract that carries it vacuous.
   Computed from the dump by the same [ltac:(eval vm_compute)] idiom as
   [img_end], so [unfold rodata_end; lia] sees a plain [Z] literal. *)
Definition rodata_end : Z :=
  ltac:(let x := eval vm_compute in KernelData.kernelRodataEnd in exact x).

Definition boot_image : gmap Z (bv 8) :=
  base.filter (fun ab : Z * bv 8 => (ab.1 < img_end)%Z)
    (KernelInstrs.kernel_bytes ∪ KernelData.kernel_data).

Definition boot_byte (a : Z) : bv 8 := default byte0 (boot_image !! a).

   imported unqualified here -- see the header note) *)
Definition boot_w64 (z : Z) : SailStdpp.Values.mword 64 :=
  SailStdpp.Values.mword_of_int z.

(* THE PLATFORM'S PMA TABLE -- THE MODEL'S OWN, three regions and the holes
   between them.  [sail_model_init] ends with one [write_reg pma_regions] of
   exactly this list (the values come from the memory map in
   model-xv6iris/sail-config-rv64d.json).  It is the BOARD's table -- written by
   [ArchReset.board_init], since the anchored boot program does not run the
   model's initializers (see that file's header) -- and it is kernel-checked
   against them anyway by [ColdBoot.board_regs_after_sim], which RUNS
   [sail_model_init] and shows this write is a no-op after it.  So a config or
   model move that changes a base, a size or an attribute breaks the build
   rather than silently making this transcription a fiction (the discipline
   [RiscvFetchExec.MISA_C] / [ColdBoot.cold_boot_misa] follow).

   WHAT THE THREE REGIONS ARE.  The boot ROM at 0x1000 is IOMemory, read-only
   and NOT executable; nothing the proofs touch lives there, and it matters
   only because it is FIRST in the list and so has to be shown NOT to match a
   RAM or a device access.  The MMIO band at 0x2000000 (size 0x10000000) is
   IOMemory R/W with no atomics and no PTE access, and every device window sits
   inside it (CLINT, PLIC, UART, virtio-mmio -- [RiscvPtsto.mmio_base]).  The
   DRAM bank at 0x80000000 (size [ram_hi - ram_lo]) is MainMemory R/W/X with
   AMOCASQ atomics -- so every AMO the decoder can produce is permitted there,
   at every width up to 16 -- and PTE reads/writes, and its range is EXACTLY
   [RiscvPtsto.addr_is_ram]'s.  It also carries a 16-byte MISALIGNED ATOMICITY
   GRANULE (the two [..._granule_size_exp] fields = 4, per Zama16b), which the
   two IOMemory regions do not (= 0, i.e. absent): that granule is what
   [pmaCheck] consults to decide whether a misaligned access is split, and it
   is irrelevant to every access these proofs perform, all of which are
   naturally aligned and therefore never split.  BETWEEN AND OUTSIDE THEM THERE ARE HOLES,
   which is why the tower's obligation is per address class
   ([RiscvFetchExec.pma_allows_ram] / [pma_allows_io]) and why an
   all-addresses one could only ever have held of an idealization. *)

   remaining PREDICATES the boot proof needs of them ([pma_allows_all
   pma_boot], the MISA bit facts, mstatus's MIE/MPRV/SXL, menvcfg's LPE) are
   consequences, proved where those predicates live (they are above this file).
   ONE conjunct is stated AS THE PREDICATE ITS CONSUMER CONSUMES rather than as
   a value -- pmpcfg's [pmp_all_off] (above): the architecture gives A = OFF
   and L = 0 per entry and nothing more, so a pinned [pmpcfg_boot] would claim
   the other five bits of all 64 entries for no consumer.  Prefer that shape for
   any future hardware-attribute conjunct.
   NO VALUE BELOW IS TAKEN ON TRUST.  [ColdBoot.reset_regs_cold_boot] runs the
   Sail model's OWN cold-boot chain ([sail_model_init]; the board's reset vector
   and hart id; [init_model]; [init_boot_requirements]) with [RiscvExec.exec]
   and proves this predicate of the register file it produces -- so the
   justification of each value is a compiled theorem, not a table, and a model
   regeneration that changes one breaks the build.  NO conjunct is an explicit
   [register_set] patch in that theorem any more.  Read ColdBoot.v's header for
   the one platform hook the interpreter cannot step and for the COLD-vs-warm
   caveat. *)

   from hart [c]'s own steps and a PowerOn's whole-machine reset, the ONLY

   one of [plic_step]'s two wire writes -- [sig_seip] or [sig_meip].  This is
   the meta-level soundness of every batched register rule: a stretch of nodes

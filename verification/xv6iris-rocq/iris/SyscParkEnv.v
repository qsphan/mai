(* SyscParkEnv.v -- THE FOUR ROWS THE FILE SYSTEM DOES NOT CARRY.

   [ProofSyscall.syscall_env] is four conjuncts: [sysc_proc_env],
   [SpecFileread.console_ready_app], [sysc_fs_env], and [FirstTok.first_done].
   Almost all of it is derivable from [FirstTok.first_done] alone --
   [first_done] is [first_addr ↦₄□ 0 ∗ FsReady.fs_ready], and [fs_ready] is
   the whole file system -- which is what makes the environment payable by a
   party that has none of it yet.  That party is the one that PARKS a fresh
   process (userinit for the first, kfork for the rest), and it matters that
   the payment be in this shape: at userinit's park the file system DOES NOT
   EXIST (forkret's boot arm establishes it, after userinit has parked), so
   nothing owned outright can stand in for it.  See SpecForkret.v's last
   header section.

   WHAT [first_done] DOES NOT REACH is exactly four rows, and this file names
   them so that the [SYSCALL] Module Type can state its producer without
   naming any of the twenty-two arms' vocabulary:

     the "nextpid" lock       allocpid's counter, main's to create
     [procs_avail None]       the slot ledger, procinit's
     [is_tickslock]           the ticks lock, main's
     [console_ready_app]      consoleinit's

   ALL FOUR ARE PERSISTENT AND ALL FOUR EXIST BEFORE EITHER PARKER RUNS --
   main creates every one of them before it calls userinit, and kfork's
   parent holds them inside the [syscall_env] it is running on.  So this
   bundle is the honest statement of what parking a process costs beyond the
   file system, and it is nothing a parker does not have.

   THE OTHER ROWS [sysc_proc_env] AND [sysc_fs_env] WANT are not here on
   purpose: the [wait_lock], [is_ftable], [procs_inv] and [disk_geom] are
   ALREADY conjuncts of [UsertrapRes.ut_park_caps], which the same parker
   pays for [ut_caps] in the same breath.  Duplicating them here would make
   a caller hold two copies of four persistent rows and prove the same thing
   twice; the producer takes them as separate arguments instead.

   THIS FILE HAS NO PROOFS.  It is a definition and its persistence
   instance, placed below [SpecSyscall.v] so the Module Type can name it,
   and above nothing at all. *)

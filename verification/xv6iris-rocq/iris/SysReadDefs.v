(* SysReadDefs.v -- THE READ OBSERVATION'S PURE VOCABULARY: the count a
   transfer answers, the slice it delivers, the readi bridges, and the
   observation's side conditions and return tie.  A LEAF: pure Coq, no
   [iProp], no [Module Type], no contract.

   WHY THE READ'S VOCABULARY LIVES IN A LEAF OF ITS OWN.  Both the
   INVARIANT layer ([FsAbsReadFire.v], the commit and its fire point) and
   the CONTRACT ([SpecFileread.v]) need [ard_count], [ard_pre] and
   [ard_ret_tie], and a spec file may not own a definition the invariant
   layer needs (design/code-organization.md), so they sit here, below both.
   [SysWriteDefs.v] is the write side's twin.

   sys_read has ONE contract, [SpecSysRead.SYSREAD], whose caller input and
   armed output are keyed on the descriptor's state; the observation commit
   it is stated over is [FsAbsReadFire.aread_commit_at], at the gtop
   AUTHORITY (an [FsAbs.astate]-shaped commit is not dischargeable -- that
   file's header is the argument).

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 0-4
   (the read row of section 4, and its "ONE CONTRACT PER SYSCALL"
   paragraph).

   ==== THE RETURN TIE, AND THE SLICE VOCABULARY ========================

   On a FILE row the tie is an EQUALITY, inherited from readi's own
   exactness (SpecReadi: two arms, "a caller learns that a returning
   readi read everything there was to read"):

       r  =  ard_count (Z.to_nat n) off (length bs)
          =  min n (length bs - off)        (0 once off >= length bs)

   and the delivered bytes are the SLICE [take r (drop off bs)] --
   spelled with stdpp's take/drop directly (no landed slice function
   exists to reuse; [FsBlocks.blk_splice] is the WRITE-side sandwich, and
   this file deliberately mints no dual).  [file_bytes_slice] below is
   the pure half of the readi byte bridge: the slice of the flat byte
   view IS [file_byte data <$> seq off r], which is [rd_delivered]'s
   per-index clause ([rd_delivered_file]) summed into a list.

   WHAT "DELIVERED" DOES NOT MEAN: the read contract says NOTHING about
   the USER buffer's contents.  readi's user arm -- the one fileread takes
   -- promises only [uptd_ext] about the destination (SpecReadi's header;
   SpecFileread inherits the silence), so the slice is VOCABULARY tying
   the return count to the observed value, not a memory postcondition.
   A kernel-arm reader (kexec, dirlookup) that wants the bytes has
   readi's own contract.

   ==== ...BUT THE LENGTH IS SAID, AND IT IS THE ANSWER =================

   [SpecFileread] / [SpecSysRead] carry the exact-count conjunct

       r = mword_of_int (Z.of_nat d)  \/  r = mword_of_int (-1)

   beside the user-memory window it is about.  So the caller learns what
   "delivered" means for the DESTINATION, at the only granularity the
   kernel proves: HOW MANY bytes moved, never which.  Joined with the
   inode arm's receipt it is [ard_ret_tie_pos] (the -1 disjunct is refuted
   on an ok arm, so the window's length IS the answer, on every row) and
   [ard_ret_tie_exact_file] (on a file row the length is the ABSTRACT
   count -- the bytes the observed state had to give are exactly the bytes
   that landed).  The -1 arm keeps only the bound [d <= max 0 n] and that
   is the CODE's doing: readi overwrites its running [tot] with -1 when a
   copyout faults, discarding blocks it has already delivered, so a read
   really can return -1 with bytes in the buffer.

   ==== THE DIRECTORY ARM ===============================================

   A readable FD_INODE descriptor may name a DIRECTORY: xv6's open()
   maps T_DEVICE inodes to FD_DEVICE but keeps T_DIR under FD_INODE
   (ls reads directories through read()).  The landed fd-state fragment
   carries only the inum, so file-ness is NOT excludable by premise --
   unlike write, where the writable bit's [ity_shot] side condition
   ("a writable fd is not a directory", [SpecFileread.fileread_pay_carve]'s
   clause) does exactly that.  The observation therefore takes the WHOLE
   [anode] and the return tie is a match:

   - [AFile bs]  -> the exact count equation above (the whole slice
                    algebra applies);
   - [ADir _]    -> BOUNDS ONLY ([0 <= r <= n]) AS AGAINST THE ABSTRACT
                    SIZE: readi still answers exactly
                    [rd_clamp (dir's size)], but a directory's BYTE size
                    (nrec * 16) is not recoverable from its [aview]
                    reading (the first-match entry map forgets the dirent
                    encoding, deliberately -- doc section 1), so an exact
                    tie to the STATE is unstatable at this abstraction.
                    It is NOT bounds-only about the DELIVERY: the
                    exact-count conjunct relayed by the contract pins [r]
                    to the window's length on this arm too, and
                    [ard_ret_tie_pos] is where the bound's existential
                    witness becomes [Z.of_nat d];
   - [ADev _ _]  -> folded into the bounds arm rather than REFUTED.  An
                    FD_INODE descriptor never names a device row, but
                    the client-visible tie "FdInode => the row reads
                    AFile or ADir" is a custody fact no landed lemma
                    exports; refuting ADev would charge the seal for it.

   The blanket the tie folds back into is [PipeInvDefs.pipe_rw_ret], which
   is what [SpecFileread.fileread_ret] is defined as -- named here rather
   than through the contract, because the contract sits ABOVE this leaf. *)

   fail), and that answer names the byte it died on: a destination address
   the process's page table does not map for WRITING --- walkaddr answered
   0 on the round's table and vmfault could not back the page, or the
   re-walk's leaf has PTE_W clear ([SpecCopyout.copyout_wrote]'s header

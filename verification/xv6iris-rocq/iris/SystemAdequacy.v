(* THE POWER-ON TRANSPORT (sync SY3-A1, design/sync.md §4.5 "PowerOn").
   The PowerOn arm runs the application's ledger step and then the crash
   slot's swap, and since SY3-A1 the first LENDS its yield to the second:
   the transport is handed the era's turn [Tn] (what the ledger's on-arm
   produced) and hands back the turn the boot is given, [Tn'].  And it
   REPACKS the slot: the durable copy that goes back into the crash slot
   is at an instance [r_s] of the transport's choosing -- the one the
   PowerOn re-bases to the new era -- beside the clone [r'] and its boot
   resource.  [app_xfer_boot_raw_of_clone] is every application that
   passes the turn across and puts the copy back as it was.
   ...AT THE DURABLE-COPY PREDICATE [Okc] (sync SY3-A3b): the slot's copy
   comes in satisfying it ([AppDur.app_dur_raw]) and the repacked one
   [r_s] goes back satisfying it.
   ...AND LENT THE MACHINE'S STARTED AUTH (sync SY3-A3bc, design 4.5 ruling
   (iii)): the swap holds [mono_nat_auth_own_frac γst 1 (gen + 1)] for the era
   generation [gen] it runs at, and passes it in and takes it back -- what
   lets an application bound its durable copy's era certificate (the

       (i) IT HAS TO BE FOUNDED -- BY [Hpow] ABOVE (lane CONS-IO milestone
       E), not here: the founding moved to the power-on step, and the
       TRANSPORT premise this theorem used to take ([Hxfer], the clone at
       the trivial predicate with the two founded claims bolted on) went
       with it.  What is left of the transport is the CLONE, and at the
       generic application the predicate and the boot resource are both
       trivial, so it is [app_xfer_boot_raw_triv] outright and no premise
       at all: a premise provable from nothing is noise on the trusted
       surface.
       (ii) THE GENERIC SLOT'S WRITE HAS TO BE LICENSED.  Every user
       process here runs on the generic user-execution slot, whose
       [write(2)] on the console is paid out of [WpUart.cons_licence]; with
       [Ores] arbitrary only the client can say that its claim survives an
       arbitrary byte.  A client whose claim does NOT survive one does not
       use this theorem: it uses [App.xv6_app_adequacy] with a constraining
       [app_pred], where the SUPPLY is what gates the licence. *)

(* [adequacy_icfg] AND [adequacy_fscfg] ARE GONE, and their deletion is the
   point of fs-cfg-boot.md stage (d2b).  They were two [Local Instance]s of
   all-[1%positive] records -- an [IcacheRefDefs.icfg] with [icfg_nib = 0] and an
   [FsCfg.fscfg] nobody allocated -- and they existed only because [fileG]
   had to be RESOLVED here: nothing in the tree could produce either record,
   so the corollaries below could not be stated without inventing them.  At
   [icfg_nib = 0] an [IcacheHeld.inode_held] cannot exist, so the boot cone's
   one assumed contract ([SpecNameiRootBoot.v]'s [namei("/")]) was VACUOUS at
   exactly the instance the corollaries were taken at.  That was a defect in
   the top-level statement, not a missing convenience.

   [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc] now MINTS both records inside the era fupd
   (off the era's own disk, at the parsed superblock's geometry) and returns
   the reassembled [fileG] existentially, so this file resolves [fileGpreS]
   -- whose only instance is [subG] on the functor list -- and never
   [fileG].  The 400 GB nontermination hazard documented at [adequacy_fscfg]
   goes with it: the cycle it blocked was
   [fileG -> subG_fileΣ -> fscfg -> file_fscfg -> fileG], and with no site
   resolving [fileG] there is nothing to enter it.  The compressed note now
   lives where [FileInvDefs.fileG_of] is APPLIED (BootShared.v §5) and at the

   IT IS NO LONGER THE ASSUMPTION AUDIT'S TARGET.  [SystemAssumptions.v]
   now audits [xv6_fs_adequacy_xv6Σ] at the bottom of this file, which is
   the theorem with NOTHING left as a premise and so the only one whose
   axiom list is the whole story.  The cost of that is real and expected:
   naming [FsImgDisk.fsimg_dk] pulls Rocq's [PrimString]/[PrimInt63]
   primitives in (MEASURED: ten extra entries, on any constant naming the
   image), so the baseline the audit diffs against is THIRTEEN, not three.
   Those ten are structural -- the same set appears on every literal-image
   theorem ([ElfKernel.v] / [ElfUser.v] / [FsImgCheck.v]) -- and
   durable-notes' "adequacy-print baseline" lists them by name so a reader
   can tell them from a regression. *)

(* assumes exactly what a reader would expect: the initial disk is mkfs's.  *)
(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* THE SYSTEM THEOREM AT THE LITERAL mkfs IMAGE -- the end of the line, and
   the [Print Assumptions] target ([SystemAssumptions.v]).

   NOTHING ABOUT THE FILE SYSTEM IS ASSUMED BEYOND THE INITIAL DISK: the
   one hypothesis is that the machine is switched on with the image mkfs
   built.  [FsImgDisk.fsimg_dk] is kernel-rocq/FsImgRaw.v's 2,048,000
   bytes, zero-padded beyond them (a virtio disk reads zeroes past the file
   backing it, and [XV6_DISK_BYTES] is larger than the image).

   THE PARAMETERS, and why each is what it is:
     [logstart] is pinned to [2], the IMAGE'S OWN [logstart]
       ([FsImgCheck.fsimg_sb_logstart] is what checks that the superblock
       says so);
     [cov] is [fsimg_cov] (section 1), NO LONGER PARAMETRIC: stocking the
       inode pool from the image forces every block a live inode names into
       it;
     [sb]/[nib] are the parsed superblock and its inode region's 13 blocks.

   THERE IS NO [Hrec] TO DISCHARGE.  There used to be: a second generic
   theorem [xv6_fs_adequacy] took mkfs's recovery obligation as a premise
   and this corollary supplied it from [FsImgDisk.fsimg_recovery].  That
   theorem was [xv6_power_adequacy] with two premises its conclusion never
   used -- provable from it by [intros; eapply xv6_power_adequacy;
   eassumption] -- so it is gone, and with it the obligation.  Do not
   reintroduce a "FS-flavoured" generic theorem: the FS content of this
   statement is entirely in [phi], and [phi] is [xv6_trace_pure].

   What the image MEANS as a file system -- [FsImg.fsimg_wf], and that
   /init /sh /echo /sync hold exactly the tracked ELF raws the U-mode proofs
   reason about -- is [iris/FsImgCheck.v], which this file Requires. *)

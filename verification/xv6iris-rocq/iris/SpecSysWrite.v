(* SpecSysWrite.v -- the public interface of sys_write(), stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer and its
   callees' SPECS -- never a whole-function proof file -- so every function
   proof can be checked in parallel.

     uint64 sys_write(void) {
       struct file *f;
       int n;
       uint64 p;
       argaddr(1, &p);
       argint(2, &n);
       if (argfd(0, 0, &f) < 0) return -1;
       return filewrite(f, p, n);
     }

   @ KernelSyms.sys_write, 72 bytes / 25 instructions.  THE OBJECT CODE IS
   SYS_READ'S, INSTRUCTION FOR INSTRUCTION -- same 48-byte frame, same slot
   assignment ([f] slot 3, the [int n] the UPPER WORD of slot 4, [p] slot 5,
   slot 6 unused), same registers, same offsets, same hoisted [c.li a0,-1]
   above the branch.  Only the three [jal] targets differ, and only the third
   differs in kind: filewrite instead of fileread.  SpecSysRead.v carries the
   listing; CodeSysWrite.v carries this one's.

   ==== THE ONE PLACE THE WRITE SIDE IS BETTER OFF ======================

   sys_write does NOT carry fileread's [MAXFILE*BSIZE + n < 2^31].  That is
   not an oversight and not a weaker statement: filewrite CHUNKS its writes
   at [max = ((MAXOPBLOCKS-1-1-2)/2)*BSIZE = 3072] bytes, so writei's joint
   numeric premise is a CLOSED fact inside filewrite's own proof
   ([SpecFilewrite]'s [fw_chunk_joint]: [n1 <= 3072] by construction and
   [off <= MAXFILE*BSIZE] by [FileInvDefs.off_wf]) rather than something passed
   up.  fs-sysfile S3f banked exactly this: sys_write may take [n] straight
   from user input where sys_read cannot.

   AND AS OF XV6_REV 31f115a IT CARRIES NOTHING ELSE EITHER.  This contract
   used to take [0 <= sys_rw_count v2], because [SpecFilewrite] wanted
   [0 <= n < 2^31].  Nothing between argint and the call tests the sign --
   the function's only branch is argfd's -- so that premise was owed to a
   caller who could never pay it, which is not a contract about a syscall.
   31f115a's [if (f->writable == 0 || n < 0)] makes it a FACT OF THE CODE:
   [SpecFilewrite] now takes the whole [int] range,
   [SpecSysRead.sys_rw_count_range] supplies it for free, and the guard
   restores [0 <= n] past the branch, so sys_write's contract says NOTHING
   about the count the user wrote.  sys_read's is now the same shape.

   ==== THE REST OF THE SHAPE ============================================

   [pfd] is NULL, so argfd's [SpecArgfd.ofd_out] costs this caller nothing,
   and the error return is hoisted above the branch so both arms reach one
   epilogue with the answer already in a0.

   ==== THE ENVIRONMENT IS OWNED, NOT OPENED (fs-sysfile S4c) ============

   S4 froze this contract with an OPENER wand, because [filewrite_env] was
   indexed by the file's CONTENT and by its fd SLOT.  S4' overturned that,
   and for a reason stronger than taste: the opener promised back a
   [file_ref gf k q'] at a SMALLER fraction, and no such thing exists --
   [FileInvDefs.fref_tok]'s reference COUNT rides in the same map entry as
   the fraction.  SpecSysFstat.v's and SpecSysRead.v's headers have the full
   account.

   What this contract takes instead is [filewrite_fs_env gf fn], which names
   neither the content nor the slot, plus the device table's WRITE column
   [filewrite_devsw fn] (whose cell address is a function of the major, so it
   is the one thing that could not be made content-independent by restating
   it -- see SpecSysRead.v).  Everything per-inode that the old environment
   asked for -- the itable slot, the inum, the device, the region bound, the
   share, its GENERATION and the fd's recorded TYPE -- comes out of the
   reference itself, and filewrite carves it
   ([SpecFileread.fileread_pay_carve], the read side's carve grown by the
   [ty] output precisely so filewrite's [ity_shot] comes from the same
   place).  The [fwn_j] / [fwn_procs] equations the opener used to promise
   are now ordinary premises of this contract, where they belong. *)

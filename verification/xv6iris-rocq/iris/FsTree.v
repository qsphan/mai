(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.

    This is the FRAGMENT CAMPAIGN's F1a increment: the pure, resource-free
    vocabulary in which "the file system's shape" can be said at all.  It
    introduces no [iProp], no ghost name and no authority; [FsRep.v] one
    level up is where the reading becomes a resource.  [DirView.v] is the
    precedent for both the placement and the style -- a pure record view
    that imports [InodeInv] only for [file_byte], with no proofmode
    reasoning anywhere below.

    ---- THE TYPE IS A STORE PLUS A ROOT, NOT AN INDUCTIVE TREE (R1) ------

    [fstree] is a [gmap Z fsnode] keyed by INUM plus a distinguished root.
    Four things force that shape and none of them is a preference:

      1. every landed inum-indexed resource is [Z]-keyed
         ([InodeRegion.dinode_at] is a [ghost_map Z dinode] element,
         [Xv6Cameras.linkUR] is a [gmapUR Z _]), so a path-keyed abstract
         state would need a coercion at every one of them;
      2. hard links make files MULTI-PARENT, so an inductive [Tree] is
         already wrong at the leaves -- the object is a DAG;
      3. [".."] has to be IN [ents] rather than derived: the on-disk
         records are keyed by record INDEX, and nothing in the model places
         [".."] at index 1 (fs-icache.md §20.17.4(b));
      4. xv6 has no rename, so the only shape movers are insert-edge and
         delete-edge -- there is no tree surgery to be structural about.

    "Directories form a tree" is therefore a DERIVED, SEPARABLE predicate
    ([fs_dirs_acyclic] below), never a property of the type.  Nothing
    landed needs it; keeping it separable means no mover has to
    re-establish it.

    PATHS ADD NO NEW DATATYPE.  [PathElems.path_elems] is already the
    name-sequence vocabulary and [DirentEnc.bname 14] is already the
    canonical name, so [fname] is a definitional abbreviation and
    [path_at] is one [foldl].

    ---- THE ABSTRACTION RELATION'S ONE TRAP: DUPLICATE NAMES (R2) --------

    **xv6's on-disk format PERMITS two live records with the same name,
    and [dirlookup] returns the FIRST ([DirView.dir_first]).  A [gmap fname
    Z] therefore loses information the format admits, and a naive fold
    over the live records is WRONG -- it would model the LAST record, i.e.
    the one dirlookup never returns.**  [dir_view] below is defined so
    that the k-th record contributes only when it WINS its own name
    ([dir_wins]), and [dir_view_lookup] is the theorem that the resulting
    map is exactly dirlookup's answer at every name.  The relation is
    used ONE-DIRECTIONALLY, bytes -> tree, never tree -> bytes.

    ---- ...AND WHY UNIQUENESS IS CARRIED AS AN INVARIANT ANYWAY ----------

    First-match keeps [dir_view] TOTAL on every byte state, with no
    definedness side conditions -- which is why it stays the definition.
    But first-match alone leaves a real hole, THE UNMASKING ARGUMENT:
    zeroing the first record of a duplicated name leaves the name still
    mapped, to a DIFFERENT inum, so the tree delta of an unlink is not
    [delete name] and sys_unlink's friendly spec would be FALSE.

    So name uniqueness is carried as an INVARIANT ([dir_names_unique]),
    per-directory and over live records only.  xv6 cannot reach a
    duplicate-name state: every insertion goes through [dirlink], which
    refuses a present name under the caller's directory lock, and
    [SpecDirlink] already exposes the maintenance fact on both arms.
    Under the invariant [dir_view] is the exact ANY-match map
    ([dir_view_live]) and record-zeroing commutes with [delete]
    ([dir_view_zero]).  Those two are what F3's unlink triple rests on.

    ---- THE ONE REAL PROOF OBLIGATION -----------------------------------

    [node_rep_inj]: the tree is a FUNCTION of the bytes, so [fs_rep] is
    determinate.  It is the analogue of [InodeRegion.diblk_bytes_inj], and
    it is proved here in its sharpest form -- [node_rep_node_of], "any
    node representing (dn, data) IS [node_of dn data]".                    *)

    with [intros (_ & _ & ->)], discarding the type tag and the uniqueness

(* **WHAT dirlink DOES TO A DIRECTORY, AT THE RECORD VIEW.**
   [dir_written_at] says only that slot [k0] now reads [(s, z)] and that no
   other record's sixteen bytes moved; that alone is not an INSERT, for two
   reasons this clause adds:

     - the slot must not have been LIVE below the old count, or the write
       would have DESTROYED a name rather than added one.  Both of dirlink's
       arms give it: the REUSE arm's slot is the free record the scan
       settled on, and the APPEND arm's [k0 = nrec] makes it vacuous;
     - the records the count GREW over, other than [k0], must be dead --
       there are none at all when the count grows onto [k0] by exactly one,
       which is what [dir_insert_append] discharges.

   [z <> bv_0 16] is what makes the new record live at all.  The two
   constructors below are the two arms; everything else here quantifies over
   [nrec]/[nrec'] separately rather than being written twice. *)

   dirlink's own, and it is the WEAKEST that makes the equation true: [s]

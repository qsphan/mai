  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* [K ty] is what the fd arm hands the application -- the receipt at the
     descriptor's TYPE, which is where the file lane parks its moved deed
     ([FileOpen.file_open_create_au]'s second receipt arm, instantiated as
     [K ty := ∃ i γo, ⌜ty = FdInode i γo OffParked⌝ ∗ fown r (Some (i, []))]).

     [Kf] is what the [-1] arm hands it, and it is NOT [emp] for this
     application: the create may have fired before [filealloc] failed, so
     the honest instance is the DISJUNCTION
     [Kf := fown r s ∨ ∃ i, fown r (Some (i, []))].  A caller that does not
     move anything takes [Kf := emp] and gets exactly the landed shape. *)
  Definition ush_open_ans2 (N : uk_names Σ) (l : list fdstate)
      (K : fdtype -> iProp Σ) (Kf : iProp Σ) (r : mword 64) : iProp Σ :=

     ∨ (⌜ r = (mword_of_int (-1) : mword 64) ⌝ ∗
        UserFd.ustd (ukn_fd N) l ∗ Kf))%I.

  (* ...AND THE CALL.  [ShSyms.open]'s entry pc in, the stub's return
     address out; the cwd crosses unchanged (open does not move it) and is
     what an application's bundle is stated at
     ([UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_open_recv_img]). *)
  (* ...AND WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IT ABOUT THE NAME (the PROGRAM STREAM).
     The four premises below were MISSING and the definition was unusable
     without them: the call is given [a0 = file], an ADDRESS, and the
     kernel's open resolves a PATH -- so a supplier that knows only the
     address cannot say the call lands on `f`, and [ush_open_ans2]'s fd arm
     (which names the DEED at `f`) could not be produced by anyone.  What
     [UkFileOpen.wp_uk_ecall_open_create_deed_d] asks for is exactly this:
     the bytes at [file] as the image the ecall reads
     ([ArgPath.arg_path_of]), that path having no non-path elements, being
     resolved from the caller's own cwd, and ending in the name [nm] the
     line redirects to (any name of the class, cut W3).
     THE LEDGER'S ANSWER IS THE FIFTH: the fd arm says the descriptor is
     fd ONE, which is the caller's business ([UserFd.ualloc_std]) -- the
     redirect child closed fd 1 before it called, so 1 is the lowest closed
     slot of its own table. *)
  (* ...AND THE DEED IS HANDED AT THE CALL, not at the call's construction
     (the PROGRAM STREAM).  It used to be an outer premise
     ([fown r s -∗ ush_open_call2 …]), and that shape makes the walk
     unprovable: the caller would have to spend its deed to BUILD the call
     resource, so a walk that dies before reaching the open drops it, and
     the lend it is holding -- which at the file era CONTAINS the deed --
     can no longer pay the early exits.  Handed at the call instead, the
     deed flows lend -> call -> receipt and every exit before the call
     still holds the lend whole.  The index is abstract ([A], at [dst] for
     the file application) because this file names no claim. *)

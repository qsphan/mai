(*  (claude-notes/completed/namei-pinned-lookup.md §13.3)                 *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(*  WHY THIS EXISTS.  [KexecDefs.kexec_ok] is spelled in thirty-one places
    across the kexec cone, and every one of them is a phase lemma RELAYING
    kexec's own exit continuation:

      wp_next true pj (fun CID => ∀ mf V' entry spv szv',
         ⌜callee_saved m mf⌝ -∗ ⌜kexec_ok V V' (mf!!!a0) entry spv szv' ..⌝
         -∗ .. -∗ WP Loop)

    A client that wants to SAY something about [entry] cannot weaken its own
    strengthened continuation into that shape: the missing side is a pure
    fact about a universally quantified [entry], and no resource the exit
    hands over determines it.  So the strengthening cannot be threaded
    through one landed relay -- it has to be threaded through all of them,
    and the cheap way to do that is to punch a hole in the relation once
    and pass the plug down.  This is the eb-generic sweep's shape exactly
    (claude-notes/completed/eb-generic-sweep.md), on the exit relation
    rather than on the interrupt index.

    THE HOLE IS IN THE SUCCESS ARM ONLY, and that is what makes the sweep
    free: [kexec_ok]'s FAILURE arm does not mention [entry] at all, so all
    eight of kexec's [bad:] tails prove [kexec_ok_q Q] with the SAME proof
    term they proved [kexec_ok] with, at every [Q].  The one site that has
    to pay is the commit block's [ld a4,-408(s0)] -- and it pays with the
    premise [forall U', Q (kxq_entry ef) U'], which is a fact about the ELF
    header the walk read, i.e. exactly the fact the pinned walk brings.

    THE HOLE'S SECOND ARGUMENT IS THE FINAL PROCESS STATE.  [kexec_ok_q]
    itself stays a claim on the ENTRY word alone -- its [Q] is
    [mword 64 -> Prop], and every [bad:] tail's proof term is unchanged --
    but [kexec_closer], which BINDS the exit's [U'], plugs the hole with
    [fun e => Q e U'] for a client-supplied [Q : mword 64 -> ustate -> Prop].
    A client of [SpecKexec.v] needs to say things about the image the run
    built ([us_M U'], its size), and only the closer can see it.

    [KexecDefs.v] IS UNTOUCHED: [kexec_ok] stays what it is, and
    [kexec_ok_q_True] below is the row that says so -- at
    [Q := fun _ _ => True] the two relations are equivalent, which is what
    makes the hole a refinement of the landed relation rather than a
    different one.

    THE HOLE HAS ONE PLUG: [KexecBridge.exec_built_Q], the fact bundle
    the exec contract's postcondition is stated over.  It stays a hole
    rather than being specialised to that plug because [Q] and [QF] are
    parameters of [kexec_closer], which every one of kexec's eight phase
    files relays; specialising changes no statement's strength and rewrites
    all eight.                                                            *)

    pure fact about the file and the frame, WHY it jumped.

(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  The kexec cone lends the block's event counter to proc_freepagetable
    and uvmalloc, so a phase that ran one of them holds the block at the
    record [upd_ev V k] with [k >= pv_ev V].  The exit it was handed is at
    [V]; this is the one conversion it needs: a relation proved against
    the LATER record is one against the earlier (the failure arm's count
    only rose further; the success arm does not name [pv_ev], so its rows
    are the same by conversion). *)

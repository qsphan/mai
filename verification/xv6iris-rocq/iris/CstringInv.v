(* CstringInv.v -- the INVERSE of [StringBytes.cstring_bytes].

   [cstring_bytes] goes string -> bytes.  The tree had no way back, so every
   reader of a NUL-terminated byte buffer had to ASSUME the split existed:
   syscall()'s [printk("%s", p->name)] fallback did (as a module axiom), and
   [SpecProcdump.proc_dump_slot] has the same shape.  It does not have to be
   assumed -- a buffer with a NUL in it DETERMINES the string, and that is
   what this file proves.

   It is its own file, rather than a third section of StringBytes.v, because
   the recovered string's own shape is [PrintkFmt.nonul] -- and StringBytes.v
   is re-exported by RiscvPtsto.v, so printk's format model is exactly what
   must not be required there.  This is the one place that needs both. *)

Lemma byte_ascii_roundtrip (b : bv 8) :

Proof.
  unfold byte_ascii.
  rewrite Ascii.N_ascii_embedding.

    apply bv_eq. rewrite Z_to_bv_unsigned.
    apply bv_wrap_small. apply bv_unsigned_in_range.

(* SpecKkill.v -- the public interface of kkill() (xv6's kill(), renamed in
   this tree because the model already owns the name), stated independently
   of its proof.

     int kkill(int pid) {
       if (pid == 0) return -1;
       for (struct proc *p = proc; p < &proc[NPROC]; p++) {
         acquire(&p->lock);
         if (p->pid == pid) {
           p->killed = 1;
           if (p->state == SLEEPING) p->state = RUNNABLE;
           release(&p->lock);
           return 0;
         }
         release(&p->lock);
       }
       return -1;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.kkill = 0x80002194, forty-three instructions: the [pid == 0]
   guard at +0x00 branching to its own [c.li a0,-1 ; c.ret] tail at +0x68,
   then a 48-byte ra/s0/s1/s2/s3 frame (slot 0 is padding), s1 the proc[]
   cursor, s2 the [pid] argument, s3 = &proc[NPROC] (which the linker places
   at <tickslock>), acquire/release per slot, one shared release-and-return-0
   block at +0x4c reached from both arms of the SLEEPING test.

   THE POINT.  kkill is the second function -- with wakeup -- that walks
   procs it does not own, and like wakeup it reaches everything it touches
   at the TOP LEVEL of [proc_lock_res] and never opens either [proc_slots]
   guard:

     - [p->pid] is the invariant's permanent half of the cell, resident in
       [SchedCtx.proc_pub];
     - [p->killed] is resident in [proc_pub] too, and existentially
       quantified there, so the store needs no premise and reports nothing;
     - SLEEPING -> RUNNABLE keeps both guards' booleans fixed, so the
       transition is [SchedCtx.proc_lock_res_wakeup] -- literally the same
       lemma wakeup uses, which is what the flat two-boolean row was for.

   THE RESULT IS 0 OR -1 AND NOTHING MORE.  Whether some proc's [pid] cell
   matches the argument is not determined by anything the caller holds --
   [proc_pub] quantifies the pid, and no resource in the tree ties a pid to
   a slot -- so the return value is existential with that two-way
   constraint, the same honesty as sys_pause's and killed's.  Making it
   sharper would need a pid->slot ghost map that no consumer wants: the one
   caller, sys_kill, hands the value straight back to user space.

   The [pid] argument itself is unconstrained: the [beq] compares the full
   64-bit registers ([lw]'s sign-extended [p->pid] against whatever the
   caller left in a0), and since both outcomes are live the contract need
   not relate them.

   The panic credentials are threaded because acquire takes them. *)

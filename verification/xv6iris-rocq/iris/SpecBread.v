(* SpecBread.v -- the public interface of bread, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     struct buf *bread(uint dev, uint blockno) {
       struct buf *b = bget(dev, blockno);   // INLINED: both scan loops
       if (!b->valid) { virtio_disk_rw(b, 0); b->valid = 1; }
       return b;
     }

   bget is static with bread its only caller, so gcc inlined it: bread's
   body contains the forward hit scan, the backward LRU recycle scan, the
   "bget: no buffers" panic, and both refcnt++/field-rewrite critical
   sections (see claude-notes/projects/bio.md for the instruction map).

   The contract (claude-notes/design/fs-log.md): one [bslot] in, a
   [bio_locked] handle out -- the buffer's sleeplock held, valid = 1,
   disk = 0, dev/blockno pinned to the request, and the data bytes EQUAL
   TO THE BLOCK'S LOGICAL CONTENT (the client payload [bv_clean]/[bv_dirty]
   inside the handle indexes the same bytes).  No [disk_block] crosses the
   interface: the covered range's disk fragments live INSIDE the bio layer
   (pool / escrow / handles), which is also what makes two concurrent
   breads of the same block specifiable -- both get served off the one
   interior fragment.

   The requested block must be covered by the client view and on the
   view's device; a caller that knows the block's logical content (its own
   [fs_chalf] half against the handle's payload half) learns the returned
   bytes by agreement -- the bio layer hands the payload out opaquely.

   The function sleeps (acquiresleep; rw's two sleeps), so it threads the
   full running-process bundle; it enters and returns at noff 0. *)

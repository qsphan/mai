  (* Ownership of a finite set of PHYSICAL bytes, as a map from address to
     current contents.  The tier is [TsoCtx.phys_ledger] -- the physical byte
     WITH its latest-write timestamp element (A6.48 ruling 4).  A raw [↦ₚ]
     was right while the device's write was invisible to the memory model;
     post-flip the completion APPENDS to the era log, and the four ghost steps
     that append owes ([Wobl_ram]) need exactly those elements.  [phys_ledger]
     still carries [addr_is_ram] underneath, so a lease still cannot name a
     device register.  It licenses no plain LOAD (no clean/dirty bit, A6.20),
     which is correct: nothing reads a leased byte through the ledger -- the
     driver reads it back through its own ctx tier after reclaim. *)

  (* THE LEASE IS AN ACCESSOR NOW, NOT AN UPDATER (A6.48 ruling 4, the

     cannot any more, because a device write APPENDS to the era log and
     [TsoCtxStore.ledger_store_ok] moves [gen_heap_interp] and [tso_interp_at]
     TOGETHER -- the interpretation's own tie relates the flat cell and the
     timestamp element, so the two authorities cannot be split across two
     lemmas.  So the lease hands its written-to bytes OUT at the ledger tier,
     the CALLER performs the one store gate, and the wand takes the new bytes
     back.  The domain is unchanged (a write set inside the lease), so the
     same lease comes back with fresh contents. *)

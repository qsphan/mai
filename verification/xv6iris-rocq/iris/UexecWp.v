(*   * THE RESUME STATE IS forall-BOUND AND CONCRETE, not [user_inv].  The  *)

(*     weakens it into [user_inv]'s existentials to call the generic WP),   *)
(*     and a verified program's WP NEEDS the concrete state.  The generic   *)
(*     inhabitant re-packs the foralls into [user_inv] internally.          *)

(*     with the residue's data IS the type and there is no free-standing    *)
(*     pure precondition for anyone to discharge.                           *)
(*   * [Rut] IS forall-BOUND (abstract).  Both tiers treat the parked       *)
(*     kernel residue opaquely, and that is what keeps the RESIDUE out of   *)
(*     this definition: [uexec_wp] never names the residue, so the loop's   *)
(*     instantiation of [Rut] with a bundle that itself carries a slot is   *)

(*   * HART-FREE (the [forall h : CpuId] is INSIDE), like [uv_cap] and the  *)

(*     rides the hart-free half of the residue.                             *)
(*   * THE HANDLER PREMISE IS A RETURN CHANNEL, and it is what makes this   *)
(*     a GUARDED FIXPOINT.  The kernel re-entry contract arrives from the   *)
(*     loop's Loeb hypothesis under a later, exactly as it always did, but  *)
(*     what user execution hands BACK at its trap is now the PAIR           *)
(*                                                                          *)

(*     so the WP the loop resumes a process with is the one the previous    *)
(*     round RETURNED, not a freshly minted generic (MILESTONE G).  The     *)
(*     recursive occurrence sits under the handler's own [>], which is      *)
(*     precisely the guard [Contractive] wants -- so the definition is      *)
(*     [fixpoint uexec_F], on the model of [ParkCap.park_token].            *)
(*     [UserExec.stvec_handler_wp] is the UNPAIRED form and stays what the  *)

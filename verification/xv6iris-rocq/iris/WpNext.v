(* WpNext.v -- the continuation of every S-mode step.

   An instruction executed with interrupts ENABLED can be trapped, the thread
   yielded, and execution resumed on a DIFFERENT hart.  So a step's
   continuation quantifies the hart -- and, because the binder is named [CID],
   every resource written inside [K] is automatically about the hart we RESUME
   on, with no annotation and no change to any resource's spelling.  That
   includes the SIE ghost: it is the hart's CANONICAL name ([sie_name], hence
   [IntrDefs.sie_gname]), so rebinding [CID] rebinds the ghost too and no
   separate ghost binder is needed.

   With interrupts DISABLED no trap is taken, so the hart is pinned.  That is
   the [b = false] implication, and it is what lets push_off'd code read [tp]
   once and keep using the answer ([push_off(); c = mycpu(); c->noff++]).
   [wp_next_off] collapses the whole thing away, so an interrupts-off (or
   M-mode) contract is stated exactly as it is today, with no binder at all.

   THERE IS A SECOND WAY THE HART IS PINNED, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT SIE: a thread
   with NO CURRENT PROC cannot be yielded.  [kerneltrap] yields only when
   [myproc() != 0], so the scheduler thread -- whose [cpus[cid].proc] is 0 --
   provably stays where it is even with interrupts on.  That datum is already
   threaded through the whole S-mode tier as [sie_arm] / [sie_cap_gpr]'s [p]
   (the value of [cpus[cid].proc]), so [wp_next] takes it and offers the second
   escape hatch [wp_next_idle].  [scheduler()] needs exactly this and no
   crossing payload could serve instead: what it holds across its
   interrupts-enabled window is REGISTER state naming the ENTRY hart's [cpus[]]
   fields, so on another hart the [sd s1,48(s4)] at +0x68 would write the wrong
   hart's [cpu->proc] -- the code would simply be wrong, which is why this is a
   refutation of migration rather than a transport of resources across one.

   This WEAKENS nothing.  The condition under which the continuation is pinned
   got LARGER, so a consumer of [wp_next] receives a stronger hypothesis, and a
   leaf that PRODUCES one still produces it at its own hart, where the
   implication holds vacuously.

   The soundness obligation this creates lands on Stage 2's
   [intr_handler_spec]: NO CURRENT PROC IMPLIES THE TRAP RETURNS ON THE SAME
   HART.  That is a true statement about [kerneltrap]; writing it down here
   makes it a premise someone must discharge rather than an accident.

   THIS FILE IS THE ONLY PLACE THAT NAMES THE HART WE CAME FROM -- and it must
   therefore live outside any section that fixes [CpuId], because Rocq refuses
   to rebind a SECTION variable's name ("CID is already used"), which is
   exactly the shadowing every consumer relies on. *)

  (* THE ELIMINATION FORM AN ENGINE USES, at an EXPLICIT hart.  A layer whose
     own step neither pins nor moves the hart (it sits between two [wp_next]s)
     transports its caller's hart-generic continuation straight to whatever
     hart its OWN callback was instantiated at, carrying the guard along.
     Stating it once keeps the guard bookkeeping out of every Iris proof.

     [CID0] IS PINNED EXPLICITLY IN THE [wp_next] BELOW, and it has to be: with
     two [CpuId] hypotheses in scope, instance resolution would fill the
     definition's own [CID0] slot from the LAST one -- [CIDn] -- and the guard
     would silently degrade to the tautology [CIDn = CIDn].  Every statement in
     this file that mentions two harts is spelled out for that reason. *)

  (* ... and the SAME-HART instance of it: an engine that provably returns to
     the hart it started on (STAGE 1 -- the absorbing Löb is at a fixed hart,
     a trap returns where it came from) consumes the hart-generic obligation
     its STATEMENT demands of callers here, with the guard closed by
     [reflexivity].  Unlike [wp_next_off] this needs no condition on [b] or
     [p]: it is the direction that is always available.

     THIS IS THE LEMMA THAT MAKES THE FUNNEL'S OWN CONVERSION FREE, AND THE
     ONE THAT MARKS WHERE THE STAGING HAS TO STOP.  Wrapping
     [WpSmodeIntr.wp_instr_s_sconf]'s σ-callback in [wp_next b p] is provable
     by exactly this: the funnel consumes the leaf's hart-generic obligation at
     its own hart and its body is unchanged.  Wrapping the callbacks of the two
     engines BELOW it ([WpIntrInv.wp_exec_step_intr],
     [WpSmodeIntr.wp_instr_s_intr]) is NOT, and [wp_next_here] is precisely the
     step that is then unavailable: the funnel would have to PRODUCE a
     hart-generic callback for the absorbing engine, and its '1' arm frames
     PER-HART residue at the entry hart across that engine -- the [sret_bits]
     halves, the SIE eighth, [cpu_hart]'s per-cpu cells, [strans_bit], and
     [intr_res] itself.  Only the trap handler can hand those back at the
     resuming hart, so that half of the move belongs with [intr_handler_spec] /
     [intr_frame], not here. *)

  (* RE-ANCHORING A CALLER'S OBLIGATION AT ANOTHER HART.  A layer whose own
     step MOVED the hart -- a parking function whose [swtch] resumed
     elsewhere, and, at Stage 2, the absorbing engine re-entering its Löb on
     the hart the last trap returned to -- holds its caller's [wp_next] at the
     hart it STARTED on and has to discharge one at the hart it ENDED on.
     Those are different propositions (the guard's right-hand side names the
     anchor), so this is a TRANSPORT, not a frame: the third instance of the
     shape [IntrDefs.cpu_own_transport] / [IntrDefs.trap_csrs_ext_transport]
     already established -- A HART-INDEXED RESOURCE THAT SURVIVES A POSSIBLE
     MIGRATION NEEDS A TRANSPORT LEMMA, NOT A FRAME.

     Sound rather than a fudge, and both halves are worth seeing.  At
     [p <> zero_reg] and [b = true] the guard is vacuous, so [wp_next true p K]
     is just [forall CID, K CID] and re-supplying it anywhere is free -- which
     is exactly the case a parking function is in ([proc_addr_nonzero] refutes
     the idle hatch).  At [p = zero_reg] the mover's OWN [wp_next] guarantees
     it came back on the same hart ([wp_next_idle]), and that is precisely the
     hypothesis [Heq].

     THIS IS WHERE [wp_next]'s SECOND ESCAPE HATCH IS CALLED IN.  The hatch was
     introduced for [scheduler()] (claude-notes/completed/explicit-cpuid.md),
     which recorded "no current proc => the trap returns on the same hart" as a
     debt against Stage 2; [Heq] is the place that debt is paid, and Stage 2's
     [IntrDefs.intr_handler_spec] is what will discharge it for the trap
     arm. *)

(* THE CONSUMER-SIDE DISCHARGE.  A straight-line stretch accumulates one
   conditional equality per instruction; this closes the function's own
   [wp_next] obligation from however many are in context, at any [b], with no
   case split.  Plain [eapply wp_next_trans; eassumption] does NOT do it -- the
   hypotheses arrive spelled [@cpu_id CIDk] while the lemma is stated at the
   bare binder -- so chain them by congruence instead.  (Note there is NO
   [split] here: since the SIE ghost went canonical the per-step fact is a
   bare equation, not a conjunction, and a [split] on an equation is
   [constructor 1] = [eq_refl] and would fail on the first chained step.) *)
(* THE GOAL'S INDEX AND THE CHAIN'S NEED NOT BE THE SAME TERM.  A PARKING
   function's own [wp_next] index is the literal [true] (a swtch moves the
   hart whatever SIE was doing), while the leaves it ran carry its caller's
   [eb] -- so the hypothesis to discharge and the chain facts are
   disjunctions with DIFFERENT left components, and a plain [specialize]
   does not typecheck.  The fallback keeps only the RIGHT disjunct (the
   left one is [true = false], absurd) and re-injects it at whatever index
   the chain fact carries.  At a matching index the first branch fires and
   nothing changes. *)

                 end; reflexivity ].

(* THE MIXED-INDEX FALLBACK, and why the per-hypothesis one above it is not
   enough.  When the GOAL's index is the literal [true] (a parking function's
   own crossing) while the chain facts carry the caller's [eb], the only
   surviving case is the RIGHT disjunct -- and every chain fact needs it, not
   just the first.  Destructing [Hd] once, up front, and re-injecting the
   right disjunct at each fact is what closes the chain; doing it inside the
   loop leaves the chain half-specialized and [congruence] then fails with no
   indication of which link is missing.
     Found by probing ProofIlock's first [wp_next_shift] after ilock's
   crossing moved to [true]: all eight links were in context and the manual
   chain closed, while the loop above did not.  These two are now branches
   FOUR and FIVE, kept verbatim behind the goal-directed fast path described
   next, so no existing call site can regress. *)
(* THE GOAL-DIRECTED FAST PATH, and why the two [specialize] loops below it
   are now only a fallback (claude-notes/optimization.md, "wp_next_chain").
   Both of those loops walk the WHOLE context and rewrite EVERY conditional
   equality in it, and a whole-function walk accumulates one per instruction:
   at [ProofNamex]'s deepest point that is ~69 of them per call and 127 calls,
   i.e. 8800 [specialize]s -- 26 % of the file -- to prove one equation that
   needs a handful of links.  The chain is a PATH, so follow it from the goal
   instead: at [?x = ?z], the only link that can matter is the one whose
   conclusion is [?x = _]; [eq_trans] consumes it and leaves [?y = ?z], and
   the walk stops at [reflexivity].  Nothing is specialized that the goal
   does not reach, and no hypothesis is rewritten.
     [refine (eq_trans ...)], not [rewrite]: the equation lands in the proof
   TERM, so the context is never touched.  (Measured: the [rewrite] spelling
   of this same walk is a REGRESSION -- ssr [rewrite] in a 200-hypothesis
   context cost more than the [specialize]s it replaced.)
     [clear H] is what makes [repeat] terminate against a cyclic pair; the
   already-built term keeps its own reference to [H], so clearing it from the
   residual goal is sound. *)

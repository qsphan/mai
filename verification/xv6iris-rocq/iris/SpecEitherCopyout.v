(* SpecEitherCopyout.v -- the public interface of either_copyout(), stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     int either_copyout(int user_dst, uint64 dst, void *src, uint64 len) {
       struct proc *p = myproc();
       if (user_dst) {
         return copyout(p->pagetable, dst, src, len);
       } else {
         memmove((char * )dst, src, len);
         return 0;
       }
     }

   @ KernelSyms.either_copyout = 0x80002260, 31 instructions / 74 bytes; a
   48-byte frame with all six slots used (ra / s0 / s1 = user_dst /
   s2 = len / s3 = src / s4 = dst).

   THE ONE THING THIS CONTRACT HAS TO SAY that neither copyout's nor
   memmove's does: [dst] is a pointer into ONE OF TWO ADDRESS SPACES, and
   which one is a run-time argument.  So the flag is reflected into the spec
   as a ghost boolean [user] pinned to the register by one premise, and both
   the precondition and [either_copyout_post] are keyed on it:

   - [user = true]  -- [dst] is a user virtual address, about which the
     caller owns nothing.  What it must hand over instead is [proc_priv]:
     the copy runs through the process's own page table, may fault pages in
     on the way, and so gives back a descriptor EXTENDING the one that went
     out ([uptd_ext] -- see SpecCopyin.v).  The answer is copyout's, 0 or -1.
   - [user = false] -- [dst] is a kernel address and the caller owns [len]
     bytes there; the body is a bare memmove, [proc_priv] is never touched
     (p->pagetable is not even read), and the answer is always 0.

   Requiring [proc_priv] only on the user arm is deliberate and not just
   economy: a kernel-to-kernel either_copyout is correct with no process
   assigned to this CPU at all.

   THE SOURCE BUFFER is a kernel buffer on BOTH arms and comes back
   unchanged on both, which is what makes it the one conjunct outside the
   [if].  On the kernel arm the caller additionally learns the destination
   now holds [src_bytes] -- memmove's guarantee, carried through verbatim.
   On the user arm the caller learns what the PROCESS will read back
   instead: the block's image comes back as the image it went in at with
   the copied prefix written at [dst] ([either_copyout_post] below).  That
   is an EQUATION on the image, not a one-sided promise -- it pins the
   untouched bytes as firmly as the written ones.

   TWO PREMISES ARE ALSO KEYED ON THE FLAG, for one reason each:
   - the length bound.  copyout takes any [len < 2^64], but the kernel arm
     narrows the count with [sext.w a2,s2] before calling memmove, so it is
     the identity only below 2^31.  That is a real restriction of the
     COMPILED code, not of the model, and it is honest to state it where it
     bites rather than to impose it on both arms.
   - [p->sz <= MAXVA] is NOT a premise at all: it lives inside [proc_priv]
     ([proc_priv_sz_bound]) and this proof pays copyout's premise out of it,
     exactly as fetchaddr does. *)

(* either_copyout's own frame is 6 slots (`addi sp,sp,-48`); copyout wants 52
   below it and myproc 10, so 52 covers every call it makes.

   52, NOT 50, AND ITS TWIN IS STILL 56 -- the asymmetry is real, not a typo.
   copyout keeps [psz] alive across walkaddr / vmfault / memmove, so gcc parks
   it in s11 and copyout's frame grew to 14 slots (`addi sp,sp,-112`), making
   its budget 14 + 38 = 52 (SpecCopyout.v).  copyIN's and copyinstr's extra
   argument dies before their first call, so their frames stayed at 12 slots
   and their budget stayed 50 -- which is why [either_copyin_stack] is
   correctly still 56 while this one is 58. *)
Notation either_copyout_stack := (58%nat) (only parsing).

(* HOW MUCH OF THE SOURCE REACHED THE PROCESS, as a pure fact about the
   returned a0.  copyout writes page by page and can give up on a later
   page (bad va, no backing, a read-only leaf), so a -1 means SOME prefix
   crossed -- and STRICTLY less than all of it, since the failure exits
   with bytes still to go ([SpecCopyout.copyout_wrote]).  A 0 means all of
   it did.  At [len = 1] the two arms are therefore "wrote the byte" and
   "wrote nothing", which is what consoleread's and piperead's one-byte
   copy loops need to say they wrote exactly what they return.  This is
   the ONLY existential left in the user arm's memory story -- a prefix
   LENGTH, not an image. *)
(* ...AND THE -1 ARM SAYS WHERE IT STOPPED AND WHY (app-echo.md, lane
   CONS-SWALLOW, W1): the byte at [dst + d] is at a page the kernel cannot
   copy to -- not mapped for the user, or mapped read-only -- in the table
   the call was ENTERED at ([SpecCopyout.copyout_wrote] says why the entry
   table is the right one).  At [len = 1] this is exactly "the one byte was
   lost, and here is the reason", which is what consoleread's swallowed-byte
   arm carries out to its caller. *)

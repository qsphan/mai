   MEANS in the boundary's own terms: the ring's 128 live bytes are echoed
   log entries no read has delivered, so the log has at least 128 echoed

   refute that input; it can say WHEN it happened -- before any byte reached
   the console's wire -- and how many bytes it was.  [flush_lost h f]: [f]
   inputs of this era were lost, and if any were, some prefix of the era's
   segment holds exactly those [f] inputs and NO console output.  The

   [log_ok] asks every entry's echo to be a LEGAL echo of its byte; but a
   legal echo is not prefix-closed -- the erase arm's [cs] is a multiple of
   the three bytes [consputc_bs], and stopping one or two bytes into an
   erase leaves something that is no echo of anything.  So the arm is
   stoppable exactly where its partial echo is itself legal, which is what
   the live contract already demands ([WpUart.in_claim_append] and
   [uart_inv_append] both take [ConsLog.cons_echo c cs] for the [cs] they

   the accepted bytes it is echoing into.

   THE WIRE CLAUSE IS WHY [acc] IS AN ARGUMENT.  [EvOpen] takes "what the
   application has accounted for is already on the wire the kernel is about
   to extend" as a premise; the application needs it again at EVERY byte of
   the arm, and between two bytes an unrelated writer's [EvOut] may have
   grown [acc].  Carrying it here is what makes it survive: every event
   either leaves [acc] alone or appends to it, and a prefix of a list is a
   prefix of its extension. *)

   ---- WHY THE CONTRACT IS THE UNION OF THREE ---------------------------

   dirlink is the campaign's widest precondition: it calls dirlookup (hence
   readi, namecmp and iget), iput on the found arm, and readi/strncpy/writei
   on the other.  So it threads dirlookup's bundle, writei's log +
   inode-region + bitmap bundle, and iput's itrunc geometry, all at once.
   It runs INSIDE A TRANSACTION (writei's bmap can allocate).

   TWO PREMISES ARE QUANTIFIED OVER RECORDS RATHER THAN NAMED, because the
   record dirlookup stops at is not known until it stops:

   - [DirView.dir_inums_ok] -- iget's argument bound (see SpecDirlookup.v).
     Since fs-icache.md §15(a) a caller gets it out of the icache: it is
     the conjunct [DirView.dir_ok icfg_nib dn data] riding in
     [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded];
   - [ireg_blocks_ok] -- iput's [IBLOCK inum inodestart] membership facts,
     stated for EVERY inum the region covers rather than for the one child.
     That is strictly the better shape: it is a fact about the superblock
     layout, provable once, instead of a fact about a directory's contents.

   ---- THE GRANULARITY PREMISE IS GONE (fs-icache.md §15(b)) -----------

   [16 | di_size dn] used to be a premise here too, refuting
   panic("dirlink read") at +0x60 (the [bne a0,s3] at +0x3e).  It is not a
   system invariant -- dirlink's OWN short-write arm is what breaks it (see
   the APPEND arm below: on [tot < 16] the new size is [16*k0 + tot]) -- so
   the short-readi turn is now a LIVE panic arm, discharged with
   [SpecPanic]'s own contract, and no caller owes granularity.  A dirlink on a
   directory a previous short write corrupted therefore PANICS rather than
   returning; that is what the C does, and it is the honest post-state.

   ---- THE ARMS ---------------------------------------------------------

   FOUND (the name is already there): a0 = -1, the directory's data, block
   map and metadata are UNCHANGED, the child reference dirlookup minted has
   been spent by iput ([used' <= used], iput's spend-at-most budget), and
   the ledger unit comes back.

   APPEND: [dir_first data nrec s = None], and writei ran at
   [off = 16 * dir_slot data nrec] -- the first FREE record, or [nrec]
   itself when every record is live, which is where the scan's own [s1]
   lands.  TWO failures answer [a0 = -1 /\ tot < 16]: a SHORT WRITE (bmap
   out of blocks), and writei's OWN -1 return.  The second is the FULL
   DIRECTORY and nothing else -- [off <= size] because the slot is at most
   [nrec], so writei's first reason ([size < off]) is dead, and its second
   ([MAXFILE*BSIZE < off + 16]) forces [off = size = MAXFILE*BSIZE], since
   [off] and [MAXFILE*BSIZE] are both multiples of sixteen and
   [size <= MAXFILE*BSIZE].  It returns with EVERYTHING unchanged at
   [tot = 0], which is what this arm's [tot = 0] corner already says, so it
   needs no arm of its own: [wi_dinode] is the IDENTITY there (the append
   offset is in range, so the size does not move, and the map is the one
   [di_addrs] already names).

   (Until D₀-a this contract carried a premise [size + 16 <= MAXFILE*BSIZE]
   that killed writei's -1 return outright.  It was UNSUPPLIABLE: it is a
   fact about [dp], the record nameiparent finds at RUN TIME, which no
   caller's contract has a word for -- and dirlink itself destroys the
   proposition by growing the directory, so it is not even preservable.  See
   projects/fs-sysfile.md, the eleventh stop.)

   On [tot = 16] the window holds [dirent_bytes (de_of_name inum s)] --
   strncpy NUL-pads, so the stored record IS [DirentEnc.de_of_name] -- and
   the size is raised by writei's own [wi_dinode].

   ---- THE RANGE CLAUSE IS EXACT (fs-icache.md §15.1(i), retrofitted) ----

   writei's postcondition concedes a DISTURBED REGION of up to BSIZE
   unspecified bytes above the written window, because a user copy that
   faults part-way is committed without advancing [tot].  dirlink writes
   from a KERNEL buffer ([user = false]), where either_copyin cannot fail
   at all, and SpecWritei now says so: [user = false -> dist = 0].  So the
   clause below is TWO-way, not three-way, and the third arm -- the SHORT
   write, [tot < 16] -- differs from the old file in exactly the [tot]
   bytes it wrote and NOWHERE ELSE.

   That is what a writer needs to re-park [DirView.dir_ok] over a
   middle-slot link: under the old clause the write could have clobbered
   up to 64 FOLLOWING records with arbitrary bytes and dir-wf was
   underivable (§15.1(i)).  [DirView.dir_ok_dirlink] is the derivation the
   tightened clause unlocks; create (fs-sysfile S5) is its first caller.

   ---- THE LINKED INUM'S RANGE PREMISE ---------------------------------

   [bv_unsigned inum < 16 * nib] on the mword-16 argument is NOT used by
   dirlink's own proof -- the [sh] stores sixteen bits whatever they are.
   It is here for the WRITER: [dir_ok] over the new directory needs every
   live record's inum inside the inode region, and the record dirlink just
   stored carries [inum].  (On a one-byte short write the stored halfword
   is [inum mod 256], which the premise still bounds -- the free slot's
   old high byte is zero.  See [dir_ok_dirlink].)  Stating it now keeps
   S5 from having to reopen this contract.  It is free for every caller:
   create's inum comes from ialloc, whose payout carries exactly this
   bound.

   NOTE ON THE NAME.  [s] is DEFINED as [bname 14 fn], the canonical view of
   the caller's own buffer, so the design's two extra caller obligations
   ("length s <= 14", "nonul s") are NOT premises: they are
   [DirentEnc.bname_length_le] and [DirentEnc.cut_nul_nonul], free.  What
   makes the stored record exactly [de_of_name inum s] is that strncpy's
   post ([SpecStrncpy.snc_post]) forces [bview 14 h = name_pad (bname 14 fn)]
   on both of its arms -- [DirView.snc_bview] is that step.

   THE BUDGET.  writei's [wi_cost off 16] is SEVEN whenever [16 | off]: the
   sixteen bytes never straddle a block, because 1024 = 64*16.  iput wants
   three.  So one constant, [dirlink_units = 7], covers both arms, and the
   postcondition is spend-at-most -- and that is what the COUNTED contract
   takes.

   THE SET-FORM CONTRACT TAKES [dl_need] INSTEAD, and it has to.  Seven is
   not a bound create can meet: its mkdir chain runs its second and third
   [dirlink]s with SIX and FIVE units in hand, so the constant makes the
   whole allocate half unprovable at every path length.  [dl_need crb ind]
   is what the call really wants -- the append arm's [wi16_need] or the
   found arm's [iput_units], whichever is larger -- and it is FOUR wherever
   the append stays inside the directory's direct blocks, which is every
   dirlink create makes on the CHILD.  The two booleans are not new
   parameters: they are [dl16_post]'s own [crb] and [ind], read off the
   entry set and the append slot, so the premise says exactly what the
   postcondition already accounts.                                        *)

(* ---- WHAT A *FAILING* APPEND SPENDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT [dl_spend].
   TWO routes reach [tot = 0].  The cheap one is writei's own -1 return (the
   FULL DIRECTORY, see the header): it answers before its loop and spends
   NOTHING.  The other is the bmap-out-of-blocks break -- writei's remaining
   break, the part-way [either_copyin], cannot happen here ([user = false])
   and is the one that log_writes before it leaves.  So the loop broke
   BEFORE its own [log_write] and the only log_writes that ran are bmap's
   (the bitmap block and the bzero'ed block, on the arm where it allocated
   one -- an allocated INDIRECT block followed by a failed data block is
   exactly that arm) and the trailing [iupdate]: [dl_spend] minus its
   data-block term, i.e. strictly less than the success arm.  That is the
   larger of the two, so it is the one the constant has to cover.

   THIS CONSTANT IS NOT THAT NUMBER, and the difference is the point.  The
   credit-aware figure IS available at zero now
   ([SpecWritei.wi16_spend_any], which is what the walk relays this clause
   from), but it is a figure and this clause is a CONSTANT -- and four is
   the honest maximum of that figure ([wi16_spend_le4]), reached by an
   allocating INDIRECT window at an unpaid bitmap block.  So no constant
   does better, and the per-call variation is what a caller would have to
   read instead.  Four buys create's non-directory [fail:] entry (+0xc4)
   and the first of its mkdir entries; the two INTERIOR mkdir entries run
   with six in hand and need three, which every DIRECT window (and every
   window at an already-logged bitmap block) provably gives --
   [CreateBudget.cr_fail_mkdir_closes] / [_ind] are that arithmetic.
   THE COLLAPSE HAS SINCE LANDED (D₀-b), so [dl16_post] no longer states
   this constant at all: its spend clause is the credit-aware figure,
   UNGUARDED, exactly as [SpecWritei.wi16_post] / [wi16_spend_any] are
   split.  What survives here is the constant itself, which
   [CreateBudget]'s [cr_fail_closes_at_zero] / [cr_fail_mkdir_at_zero_
   busts] are stated at, together with the two bridges a caller that
   prefers the constant to the figure still reaches it by. *)

(* ElfUser.v -- THE SANITY CHECK, U-MODE SIDE: each generated user-program
   dump IS that program's ELF, read through the general ELF64 semantics.

   Sibling of [ElfKernel.v], which does exactly this for the kernel; read
   that file's header first -- the motivation (the dumper's reasoning is
   what the proofs call "the program", so a dumper bug is invisible to
   them), the method ([pstring_hex_bytes] over the raw blob, the general
   semantics of [ElfFile.v] on top, [vm_compute]d decidable checks bridged
   with [bool_decide_eq_true_1]), the [Typeclasses Opaque] discipline, and
   the leaf-by-design rule (NOTHING IMPORTS THIS FILE, and nothing should)
   are all identical here and are not repeated.  This file is the same
   theorem set six more times, for the six verified user programs:
   [sync], [echo], [sh], [init], [cat], [grep] -- and a seventh time for
   [seccomp], the binary the seccomp round execs (inum 23).

   WHAT IS NEW HERE, AND WHY IT IS WORTH FOUR MORE INSTANCES.  These are
   not just four more binaries: their SHAPES exercise parts of the general
   semantics that the kernel's single RWX PT_LOAD never reaches.

     - TWO PT_LOADs per program, not one.  A text segment R-E at vaddr 0
       and a writable segment above it holding .data + .bss.  So
       [elf_file_image] / [elf_zero_image] / [elf_image] are genuine
       [segs_union] FOLDS over two segments here, and the disjointness
       side conditions of [elf_image_split] are doing real work rather
       than degenerating to a one-element list.

     - The text segment has [filesz = memsz], so ITS zero map is EMPTY.
       The whole .bss comes from the second segment; the [∅ ∪ _] leg of
       the fold is on the critical path of every zero-image theorem.

     - [sync], [echo] and [cat] have a PURE-BSS writable segment:
       [filesz = 0].  It contributes NO file bytes at all --
       [seg_file_bytes] is an empty [take] -- so their entire file-backed
       image comes from the text segment, while their .bss comes from a
       segment with no file window.

     - The ENTRY IS NOT THE LOWEST TEXT ADDRESS ([syncEntry] = 0x12,
       [echoEntry] = 0x7c, [shEntry] = 0x9ac, [initEntry] = 0xbc,
       [catEntry] = 0xf6): xv6
       links `start` ahead of `main`, and [elf_entry] must report the
       header's [e_entry], not [elf_mem_base].

     - FOUR program headers, only two of them PT_LOAD: a
       PT_RISCV_ATTRIBUTES and a PT_GNU_STACK sit in the table and MUST be
       filtered out by [elf_loads] / [elf_segments].  The kernel's table
       has nothing to filter, so this is the first check that the filter
       is right.

   As in [ElfKernel.v], each raw is the LITERAL file [user/_<p>] -- the
   binary exec() runs and mkfs packs into fs.img, byte for byte, DWARF
   included.  The files are byte-identical across build trees because the
   xv6 build passes [-ffile-prefix-map=$(CURDIR)=.] (DWARF would otherwise
   embed the absolute build directory); the dumper refuses a file that
   embeds its own build directory.

   These files are smaller than the kernel's -- 34-58 kB against 285 kB --
   so the whole file stays cheap even though every theorem re-decodes its
   program's raw.

   If a [vm_compute] here ever fails, DO NOT weaken the statement.  A
   mismatch between a dump and its binary is precisely the event this file
   exists to catch: find the disagreeing address (compute both sides'
   lookup) and fix the dumper.  *)

(*  ONE REDUCTION, NOT TWO -- the same [vm_eq] [ElfKernel.v] carries, and
    its header is where the reasoning lives.  In short:
    [vm_compute. reflexivity.] reduces the goal in the tactic engine and
    the KERNEL then re-runs the same reduction at [Qed] to check the
    [vm_cast] the tactic left behind, so every sentence below pays its
    [vm_compute] twice; [vm_cast_no_check] hands the kernel that cast
    directly and typechecks nothing at tactic time.  Same proof term, same
    VM, this file 25.1 s -> 14.0 s.

    IT MUST BE THE **RIGHT** SIDE: [eq_refl rhs] casts [rhs = rhs] to
    [lhs = rhs] and the VM evaluates the heavy side once, where [eq_refl
    lhs] evaluates it TWICE and lands worse than the [vm_compute] it
    replaces (measured on [ElfKernel.v]: 54.0 s baseline, 28.7 s right,
    78.3 s left).

    THE COST: a disagreement now surfaces at [Qed] as a kernel conversion
    failure with no goal in view.  Put [vm_compute. reflexivity.] back on
    the ONE failing lemma to see it -- and then fix the dump, never the
    statement (the note at the top of this file). *)

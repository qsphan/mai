(* LockSet.v -- THE PER-CPU HELD-LOCK SET, ORDERED.

   Every hart owns a ghost set of the NAMES (the string [initlock] was given)
   of the spinlocks it currently holds; the ORDER on those names is
   [LockRank.lock_rank], and it lives in [locks_below] rather than in the set.
   The
   authority rides in [IntrDefs.cpu_hart] -- with the running kernel thread
   while interrupts are off, inside [sie_arm true] while they are on -- and a
   lock whose [lk->cpu] field is SET keeps the matching fragment
   [lk_in i s] inside its own invariant ([WpLock.lock_inv]).  So

       "lk->cpu = &cpus[i]"   and   "name(lk) is in hart i's held set"

   are ONE fact, not two: the fragment cannot be forged and cannot be
   duplicated, and agreement against the authority reads the membership off it
   ([cpu_locks_in]).

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   WHY RANKS, AND WHAT THAT DELETED

   [gset_disj] gives exclusivity and unforgeability, but minting a fragment
   needs [r ∉ S].  That is supplied by acquire's ORDER PREMISE
   ([LockRank.locks_below S r], via [locks_below_not_elem]) -- "everything you
   hold ranks strictly below the lock you are taking", which is the deadlock
   discipline itself and is trivial at [S = ∅].

   This is the whole reason the set is cheap.  The predecessor keyed on lock
   ADDRESSES and had no order premise, so it had to DERIVE [lk ∉ S] from the
   machine: the hart co-owned HALF of every held lock's [lk->cpu] cell, pinned
   at [cpus_ptr i], and freshness fell out of the cell disagreeing at 0.  With
   the premise supplying freshness directly, that half-cell apparatus
   ([lk_stake], [lk_cpu_half], the 1/2 fractions and the two exchange wands in
   the cpu-word store leaves) is gone: the lock invariant owns its [lk->cpu]
   cell WHOLE in every state, and the set is pure ghost -- [cpu_locks_at] is
   the authority and nothing else, with no big-op over held locks.

   Two consequences worth knowing:

   - the fragment's exclusivity now says NO TWO LOCKS OF THE SAME FAMILY may
     be held at once, which is a restriction xv6 satisfies (LockRank.v's
     header) and which acquire's premise already implies;
   - [set_solver] WORKS here.  Over [gset (mword n)] it crashes with "No
     matching clauses for match" -- Sail's [Decidable_eq_mword] against
     stdpp's [bv_eq_dec] -- which is why the durable notes carry a
     discharge-by-named-lemma rule for this file.  With [nat] elements that
     rule no longer applies and the named-lemma spellings below are ordinary
     stdpp.

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------
   THE TIE IS STILL A FACT ABOUT THE MACHINE, and it is what makes acquire's
   [if(holding(lk)) panic] arm DEAD rather than merely discharged: a hart
   whose set omits [rank lk] cannot have [lk->cpu = cpus_ptr i], because the
   only state in which the cell reads [cpus_ptr i] is the one whose invariant
   holds [lk_in i (rank lk)] -- and that agrees against the authority.  See
   [WpLock.lock_inv] for where the fragment sits. *)

  (* ---- THE LEVEL/SET COUPLING -------------------------------------------

     [size lks <= n]: the hart holds no more locks than it has outstanding
     [push_off]s.  It is TRUE because every acquire pushes exactly once and
     every release pops exactly once, while a BARE push_off/pop_off pair moves
     [n] without touching the set.

     WHAT IT BUYS, and it is the reason it exists: at [n = 0] it reads
     [size lks <= 0], i.e. [lks = ∅].  That is exactly what pop_off's
     re-enabling branch must produce -- [cpu_own]'s [b = true] arm demands an
     empty held set -- so "you may only turn interrupts back on holding no
     spinlock" becomes DERIVED from the counting discipline rather than
     imposed as a separate conjunct.

     WHY IT IS BUNDLED WITH THE AUTHORITY rather than added as a third
     conjunct of [cpu_priv]: 24 sites across 8 files destructure the cpu
     bundle positionally, and keeping [cpu_priv] at two conjuncts leaves every
     one of those patterns matching unchanged.

     IT IS NOT PRESERVED BY A BARE [pop_off] ON ITS OWN -- unwinding [S n] to
     [n] with the set untouched needs [size lks <= n], which the invariant at
     [S n] does not give.  pop_off therefore takes it as a PREMISE, and that
     premise is the honest content of "you may only unwind a push once
     whatever it was paired with is gone": release discharges it because it
     has just deleted a rank ([size (lks ∖ {[r]}) = size lks - 1 <= n]), and a
     bare pusher discharges it from its own pre-push fact, which is pure and
     therefore still in context at the pop. *)

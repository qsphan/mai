(* SpecConsoleinit.v -- the public interface of Consoleinit, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

     void consoleinit(void) {
       initlock(&cons.lock, "cons");
       uartinit();
       devsw[CONSOLE].read  = consoleread;
       devsw[CONSOLE].write = consolewrite;
     }

   consoleinit is the first thing main() calls, and it is a pure composition:
   its contract is exactly initlock's on [cons.lock] (which sits at offset 0 of
   the [cons] global, so [&cons.lock = &cons]) + uartinit's, plus the two
   function-pointer stores.  So it carries uartinit's DEVICE transit one level
   up, verbatim: in come [WpUart.uart_inv Uart0], the "everything accepted has been
   transmitted / the transmitter is mine" pair at [l], and the UNFROZEN DLAB
   half at an arbitrary [b0]; out come the tokens at the same [l] (uartinit
   writes no THR) and the frozen [uart_dlab_off].  See SpecUartinit.v for why a
   raw [uart_frag] shape is not viable here: the UART thread runs from step 0,
   so the fragment can never sit raw in a CPU's precondition, and the
   FIFO-clear / DLAB-set writes are discharged by ghost arithmetic instead.

   The devsw[] slots are handed back as the raw 8-byte cells holding the two
   function addresses.  Nothing yet says what a [struct devsw] entry MEANS --
   consoleread/consolewrite are unproven and the fs-side dispatch that reads
   these slots does not exist -- so anything richer would be a predicate with no
   consumer.  When one arrives it is built at the caller from these cells.

   TWO LOCKS ARE INITIALIZED UNDER THIS CONTRACT: [cons.lock], by consoleinit
   itself, and [tx_lock], by the uartinit call it makes.  tx_lock is a [struct
   spinlock] and uartinit ends with [initlock(&tx_lock, "uart")], so its
   storage rides through here as [SpecProcinit.lk_raw] in and [lk_fresh] out
   -- three cells over 24 bytes.
     It is PURE TRANSIT: consoleinit never names a field of it, and the round
   trip costs this contract nothing at all -- not even a stack slot, since
   [initlock] is no deeper than the frame consoleinit already reserves for
   uartinit.  What it BUYS is that [lk_fresh] reaches a caller that can run
   [WpLock.newlock], which is the missing half of
   [WpLock.newlock], once a boot assembly wants the transmit lock.

   ProofConsoleinit.v proves it as a functor over [INITLOCK] and [UARTINIT];
   consoleinit touches no MMIO of its own, so the device side is pure transit
   into and out of the uartinit call. *)

       struct proc *p = myproc();
       intr_off();
       w_stvec(TRAMPOLINE + (uservec - trampoline));

       x |=  SSTATUS_SPIE;         // interrupts on in user mode

     }

   @ KernelSyms.prepare_return, 116 bytes / 42 instructions (CodePrepareReturn.v).

   IT IS THE HAND-OFF OUT OF THE KERNEL-TRAP REGIME, and that -- not the
   stores -- is what the contract is about.  Everything it does splits in
   two:

     (a) FOR THE sret THAT FOLLOWS (userret): mstatus.SPP := 0 and
         mstatus.SPIE := 1, so the sret lands in User with interrupts on;
         sepc := p->trapframe->epc, the user pc to resume.
     (b) FOR THE NEXT TRAP IN (uservec): stvec := TRAMPOLINE, and the four
         KERNEL words of the trapframe re-armed -- kernel_satp, kernel_sp,
         kernel_trap, kernel_hartid -- which is the state uservec reads on
         its way back in ([SpecUservec.v]).

   THE EXIT INDEX IS [false] AT EITHER ENTRY INDEX, and that is the
   load-bearing fact of the whole contract: whatever SIE was, prepare_return
   leaves with interrupts off, holding the trap CSRs.  The entry index [b] is
   a PARAMETER because both values are reachable --

     - [b = true]  forkret, and usertrap's SYSCALL path (which does its own
                   [csrsi sstatus,2] before the [jal syscall]);
     - [b = false] usertrap's devintr / vmfault / unexpected-scause paths,
                   which never re-enable interrupts after the trap cleared
                   SIE.

   A contract pinned at [b = true] covered only the first, which is what made
   usertrap unprovable against it.

   WHERE THE FUNCTION'S RESOURCES COME FROM, PER ARM.  Everything it needs
   beyond the process block is the trap-CSR bundle, and
   [WpIntrOff.wp_intr_off_lvl0_s_sconf] delivers it at either index:

     - at [b = true] the [csrci] is a REAL flip and pays out [trap_csrs] --
       the trap-scratch cells, [intr_res] (which OWNS the stvec cell, since
       30041d61), and the KPT RECEIPT [strans_bit_kpt] (IntrDefs §6b).  So
       the caller supplies neither stvec nor satp access: the function's own
       [intr_off] hands it both, and [trap_csrs_ext true = emp];
     - at [b = false] the [csrci] clears a bit that is already clear, so
       nothing is paid out and the caller brings the same bundle itself
       ([trap_csrs_ext false = trap_csrs]) -- which a trap handler always
       holds, the TRAP having given it to it.

   Either way the code from +0x10 on runs at [false] over one bundle, and is
   proved once.

   ...WHICH IS WHY THE POST HANDS BACK [trap_csrs_raw] AND NOT [trap_csrs].
   After prepare_return this hart has NO KERNEL TRAP HANDLER INSTALLED --
   traps now go to uservec, whose contract is not [intr_handler_spec] (it
   never returns to the interrupted pc; it runs usertrap and sret's to user)
   -- so claiming [intr_res] at TRAMPOLINE would be FALSE.  What comes out
   is the four cells, the written stvec cell, the SIE quarter that lived in
   [intr_res], and the receipt.

   AND THAT DANGLING QUARTER IS THE SAFETY ARGUMENT.  [sie_ghost_flip] needs
   all three fractions, so with the quarter loose nothing can set SIE = 1
   until it is folded back into a real [intr_res] -- i.e. interrupts cannot
   come back on before the sret, which is exactly what the C comment claims
   and what the ORDER of prepare_return's own instructions establishes:

       // because a trap from kernel code to usertrap would be a disaster,
       // turn off interrupts.
       intr_off();

   The [csrw stvec] is legal only after that [csrci], and the proof cannot
   be rearranged to do it the other way round.  Note the argument survives
   the [b = false] entry unchanged: there the quarter arrives inside the
   caller's own [intr_res] and leaves dangling all the same, so the invariant
   "no [intr_res] between here and the sret" is established on both arms.

   WHAT THE CALLER STILL OWES: the process block (for the trapframe page and
   [p->kstack]) and the scheduler/cpu context myproc() reads.  Nothing
   about the kernel page table -- the receipt out of the flip opens the
   translation slot's KPT arm ([IntrDefs.strans_inv_acc_kpt]) and
   [KptShare.tlb_res_pt_satp_acc] reads satp off it, so [kernel_satp] lands
   [satp_rooted] at an EXISTENTIAL root.  That root stays existential on
   purpose: the sconf tier is deliberately root-free, and the caller
   identifies it with [kroot] at the boundary where [kroot] is named
   ([SpecUsertrap.v]'s [satp_rooted vksat' kroot]). *)

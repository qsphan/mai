  (* [ProcInv.proc_priv_core] with [cwd_ref] taken off -- so: the two size
     invariants, the thread's HALF of [p->pid], the scalar fields, the
     address space and the trapframe page, and nothing else.

     IT LIVES HERE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT.  What wants it is the
     sleeplock chain: acquiresleep does [lk->pid = myproc()->pid], so it
     needs read permission on [p->pid], and the honest premise is the block
     the caller actually has rather than a bare fraction of one field --
     [p->pid]'s permission is split permanently between this block and
     [SchedCtx.proc_pub] behind [p->lock], so a threaded fraction can only
     have been BORROWED out of here, and every caller had to extract it and
     splice it back.  Worse, a contract asking for the block AND a fraction
     was asking for three quarters of a cell of which two are reachable:
     unpayable, and unrefutable by any proof (3/4 <= 1).  sys_close and
     sys_pipe both shipped with exactly that defect.

     But [proc_priv_core] itself cannot be that premise for the block layer,
     because [cwd_ref] is an INODE REFERENCE: taking it would put [fileG],
     [icfg] and the whole file layer into the binder list of every contract
     from acquiresleep and bread up -- fifty-odd files that have no business
     knowing what a working directory is, and a build that serialises the
     buffer cache behind [ProcInv].  Dropping the one file-shaped conjunct
     removes all of it: this file requires [ProcGeom]/[UserPtTree]/
     [ProcPtOwn] and nothing above them, and [ProcInv.proc_priv_core_bare]
     is the [⊣⊢] that puts the two back together.  A caller holding
     [proc_priv] therefore hands the chain THIS and keeps [cwd_ref] and its
     descriptor array in hand -- one iff, no borrow, no closer, no
     fractions. *)
  (* ---- THE MEMORY CONJUNCT IS THE **LAZY** VIEW ----------------------
     [ProcPtOwn.proc_ptm P sz M] rather than [proc_pt P M]: the image is
     the process's OWN view of its memory -- one byte per user virtual
     address below [p->sz] (rounded up), reading 0 wherever the table has
     no leaf yet, because that is what the process will read there once
     vmfault has done its work ([UserPtTree.umem_lazy]).
       WHY.  At the mapped-domain view a page FAULT extends [M], so
     copyin -- which faults pages in mid-copy -- could only promise "the
     image grew", which says nothing about the prefix it had already
     copied.  At this view vmfault is a NOOP on [M]
     ([SpecVmfault.wp_vmfault_sconf_mem]: same [M] on both arms), so
     copyin and every fault-only path preserve the block's state exactly.
     That is the whole reason [proc_priv] names the image at all.
       The size index is [p->sz], which is already a field of [V], so
     this adds no argument.  The MAPPED view does not go away: it is what
     the user-facing seam ([UserPtTree.user_pt_inv], uservec/userret) and
     the sub-[proc_priv] copy cone keep speaking, and the crossing is
     [ProcPtOwn.proc_ptm_at_of_pt_at] / [proc_pt_at_of_ptm_at] (a submap
     is pinned by its domain, so the round trip is lossless). *)

(* SysLinkBudget.v -- THE OP-WIDE LOG LEDGER OF sys_link, ARM BY ARM,
   MACHINE CHECKED AT EVERY CORNER OF THE REPORTED BOOLEANS.
   [CreateBudget.v] is the model; everything here is stated at the figures
   the LANDED contracts state, never at an arm's assumed booleans.

   sys_link's transaction is

     begin_op                                     ten units, empty set
     namei(old)          success                  [SpecNamei.wp_namei_gen]
     ip->nlink++; iupdate(ip)                     [SpecIupdate.wp_iupdate_link]
     iunlock(ip)                                  nothing logged
     nameiparent(new, name)                       [SpecNameiparent.wp_nameiparent_gen]
     ilock(dp)                                    nothing logged
     dirlink(dp, name, ip->inum)                  [SpecDirlink.wp_dirlink_gen]
     iunlockput(dp); iput(ip)                     [SpecIunlockput] / [SpecIput]
     end_op

   with [bad:] -- [ilock(ip); ip->nlink--; iupdate(ip); iunlockput(ip)] --
   reachable from the nameiparent failure and from either dirlink failure.

   THE CORRELATION CLAUSE.  Neither walk takes a bitmap credit, so both may
   report [w = true] and spend a unit; but a walk that DID spend it reports
   [bmapstart ∈ Sb'], so at the one corner where the dirlink runs
   UNCREDITED both [walk_spend]s were zero and the count is two higher.
   That is [sl_corr], and every arm below is checked at both corners --
   the same device [ProofCreate]'s mkdir arm needed ("`bmapstart ∈ Sb3 \/
   9 <= n3`", fs-sysfile step 1a).

   THE VERDICT.  Every arm closes, and three of them EXACTLY.  The one
   that decided a contract is dirlink's FOUND arm: it is payable only
   because [SpecDirlink]'s post states the found arm's own spend
   ([found = true -> ncount - iput_units <= n']).  Against the counted
   [dirlink_units] alone it is unpayable at every corner --
   [sl_found_counted_busts] / [sl_found_counted_busts_by_one] are that
   refutation, kept for the reason [CreateBudget.cr_fail_counted_busts] is
   kept -- and [sl_found_at_four_busts] is why three, not four, is the
   figure the clause had to state. *)

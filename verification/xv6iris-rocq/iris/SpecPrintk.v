(* SpecPrintk.v -- the public interface of Printk, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof
   file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int printk(char *fmt, ...);

   THE POST SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THE OUTPUT, and returns 0.  At XV6_REV 163d39b
   printk's character sink is [prputc] -- uartputc_sync at the SECOND 16550 --
   and nothing in the system tracks that wire (claude-notes/projects/
   xv6-bump-163d39b.md, "THE OWNER'S RULING: UART1's output is
   unconstrained").  So the trace claim this contract used to carry --
   a sublist trace claim in, its extension out, with the bytes existential
   -- is gone in both directions, and with it the [γl]/[γd]/[γv]/[bs]
   parameters that existed only to state it.  What replaces the three console
   credentials is ONE: [SpecPrputc.prputc_env].

   THERE IS ONLY ONE PATH NOW.  printk.c's two [volatile int] globals are
   deleted:

       -volatile int panicking = 0;
       -volatile int panicked  = 0;
        printk(...) { -if (panicking == 0) acquire(&pr.lock);  +acquire(&pr.lock); ... }

   so printk ALWAYS takes [pr.lock], and the whole panic-path story this file
   used to tell -- "printk then takes NO pr.lock, and uartputc_sync does no
   push_off/pop_off, which is why no lock resource and no [intr_count] appear
   here" -- describes code that no longer exists.  Three things follow.

   (a) THE FLAG CELLS ARE GONE.  No [panicking]/[panicked] points-to premises,
       no postcondition copies of them, and no [eq_vec]/[neq_vec] refutation
       premises selecting the path.

   (b) THE LOCKS ARRIVE.  Two of them, and both are persistent credentials
       rather than resources: [pr.lock] itself, which after the transmitter
       moved out of it protects NOTHING ([pr_res] below is [emp] -- see
       (c)), and, inside [SpecPrputc.prputc_env], the SECOND port's tx_lock,
       which every byte below needs.  With them comes the ordinary
       spinlock-caller accounting: [cpu_own] threaded net-zero (printk leaves
       the interrupt level as it found it), and a transient bound on [noff] --
       [+2] here, not [+1], because printk holds pr.lock while the cone below
       takes that tx_lock.

   (c) THE TRANSMITTER IS NOT THREADED, AND NEITHER IS A TRACE.
       [uart_tx_own] is [tx_lock]'s resource, so it is neither a premise nor a
       postcondition.  And the trace claim is not weakened but ABSENT: the
       bytes go to UART1, whose wire is unconstrained by ruling, so there is
       nothing for printk to promise and nothing for a caller to accumulate.
       [SpecPrputc.v]'s header carries the ruling and the reasoning; the
       justification chain uartputc_sync still asks for is built inside
       [ProofPrputc] out of nothing at all.

   THE REST OF THE PRECONDITION is unchanged, and it has exactly three parts
   beyond the usual capability/config boilerplate.

   1. THE FORMAT STRING is a real C string: [fmt ↦ₛ{dqf} f] with [nonul f].  It
      is handed back untouched -- printk only reads it.

   2. THE VARARGS.  A variadic call has no types at the call site, so the caller
      DESCRIBES its arguments: [descs] says, for each vararg in order, whether it
      is an integer-ish value ([PkANum] -- %d/%u/%x/%p/%c and the long forms), a
      null [char *] ([PkANull], which printk prints as "(null)"), or a [char *]
      to a string it owns ([PkAStr dq s]).  The description must MATCH the
      format string --

          pk_kinds f = map pk_desc_kind descs

      -- which is the honest statement of C's unchecked contract: a "%s" whose
      argument is not a string is undefined behaviour, and here it is simply
      unprovable.  The [PkAStr] resources are handed back with the same
      fractions.

      The varargs themselves are not extra parameters: the ABI puts them in
      a1..a7, so vararg [j] IS [m0 !!! a(j+1)] ([pk_vararg]).

   3. AT MOST SEVEN VARARGS.  printk spills a1..a7 into its own frame and walks
      [ap] up through them; an eighth [va_arg] would read the CALLER's frame,
      which printk does not own.  So [length descs <= 7] is a genuine caller
      obligation -- and one every call site in xv6 meets with room to spare. *)

(* ========================================================================
   THE WEAK COROLLARY.  [wp_printk_sconf_body] above is the real, code-derived
   contract, and it is what ~15 non-trace callers (main's boot banners,
   usertrap's unexpected-scause diagnostic, and several fs.c error arms) do
   NOT want to carry in full: threading a general [n] and the return-value
   postcondition through a whole proof cone just to call printk once is pure
   overhead.  (Until 163d39b the gap was much wider -- [γl], [bs] and a trace
   postcondition too -- and it is worth noting that the ruling on the second
   port's wire has made the FULL contract nearly as cheap as this corollary.)

   [wp_printk_gen_sconf_body] is [wp_printk_sconf_body] with [n := 0] baked in
   and the return-value postcondition dropped -- the strictly weaker fact
   those callers actually need.  [printk_env] bundles the two persistent
   credentials that instantiation wants (pr.lock's [is_lock] and
   [SpecPrputc.prputc_env]) as ONE.  [LinkPrintk.v] proves the contract once, as a
   corollary of [PRINTK] above, and every consumer threads that proof (or, for
   main/main-secondary/usertrap, the [PRINTK_GEN] functor it also seals).

   ITS ARGUMENT LIST DID NOT MOVE AT 163d39b, and that is deliberate: [γd] and
   [γv] survive as parameters of [printk_env] (and hence of this corollary)
   even though the credential no longer names the console's device bundle,
   because ~55 files thread them and a premise that is merely unused is still
   provable.  What changed is the DEFINITION of [printk_env], one file, no
   fan-out -- and the one construction site, [ProofMain.v]'s [mn_grp_printk],
   which now has to supply the second port instead of the console. *)

(* the [pr] lock, the one object the general path touches that panic's own
   call site does not thread explicitly.  [static struct { struct spinlock

     IT NAMES THE SECOND PORT NOW.  What used to be here was the console
     quadruple -- [uart_dlab_off γd], [dev_inv γd γv], an existential
     [is_txlock γl γd] and the trivial justification chain.  printk prints
     through [prputc] at XV6_REV 163d39b, so every one of those is the wrong
     port's, and [SpecPrputc.prputc_env] (UART1's invariant, UART1's tx lock
     with its frozen DLAB, and the .data word UART1's MMIO base is loaded
     from) is what the cone actually consumes.  The trace witness is not
     re-pointed but DROPPED: nothing tracks that wire, so nothing below asks
     for one.

     [γd]/[γv] STAY IN THE ARGUMENT LIST even though only [pr_res γd] still
     mentions one, and [pr_res] is [emp].  Keeping the arity is what makes
     this a one-file change: ~55 files name [printk_env γpr γd γv] and none

     same [prputc_env].  So any site already carrying the general printk
     credential can call panic without gaining a premise -- which is what
     makes the first conversions free, and what kept this derivation working
     across both the 06ea57f emptying and the 163d39b refill. *)

(* PipeOut.v -- THE PIPELINE APPLICATION'S CONSOLE CLAIM, ITS TAG, ITS
   TURN, ITS STEPS AND ITS LEDGER.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-pipe.md sections 4.1 and 5.5,
   lane PIPE-STAGE, deliverable 2.  This is [EchoOut.v]'s Iris half at
   [PipeDisc.sessp]: the same merged console claim over one
   [ConsLog.cons_hist], the same per-era authorities, the same ledger shape.

   WHAT IS REUSED AND WHAT IS NEW.

   - THE FIXED PART IS THE ECHO APPLICATION'S, unchanged: [EchoOut.echo_gn]
     (the taint counter's gname and the era map's).  Upstream's FILE
     application needed a SECOND gname for its own per-era map; a pipe dies
     with its era, so there is no second map, no second per-era record, no
     boot value and no typed witness.  [pipe_cl_all] IS [AppEcho.echo_cl]
     and [pipe_birth_all] IS [AppEcho.echo_birth].
   - THE STAGE RECORD IS [EchoOut.ostage], REUSED VERBATIM.  Nothing is
     added per era, so [postage] below is a definitional alias and every
     one of [EchoOut]'s [cs_len_ok] lemmas applies unchanged -- only
     [cs_len_ok_echo], which reads the block a completed line owes, needs a
     twin ([cs_len_ok_p_echo]), because the "no alternative prints nothing"
     fact is the pipeline model's.
   - THE PROLOGUE LENGTH LAW NEEDS A TWIN ([ps_len_ok_p]): it names
     [pro_idx] and the round-opening test [cs !!! _ = 3], which at this
     model are [PipeDisc.pro_idx_p] and [palt_panic (palt_at cs _)].
   - THE GHOST ALGEBRA IS IMPORTED WHOLE: [EchoOut.era_pins], [era_pin],
     [turn]/[turn_auth]/[turn_lb], [cs_auth]/[cs_lb], [ps_auth]/[ps_lb],
     [Elist_auth]/[Elist_lb]/[inp_lb], [dl_cnt], [eturn], [pin_map],
     [era_full] and the whole [ch_E] layer (which is about the console log
     and knows no discipline).  [pturn] IS [EchoOut.eturn].
   - THE RANGE CONDITION is [PipeOutPure.alts_pre_p] where the echo claim
     carried [Forall (fun i => i < 4) (o_cs so)].  Out of range [!!!] reads
     [0], which decodes to [PipeDisc.PEcho 0], and after PIPE-MODEL-2's
     ruling [palt_ok (LPipe _) (PEcho 0)] is FALSE -- so no total condition
     works and the pointwise one plus [alts_pad_p] is the route, exactly as
     at the file application.

   NOTHING IS TAKEN AS A HYPOTHESIS: the ledger's counter reads
   [PipeDisc.disc_p_dec] (lane PIPE-DEC).  Per that lane's warning, no
   [decide] on this file's path is ever EVALUATED -- every ledger step
   rewrites with [decide_ext] at one of [PipeOutPure]'s closure laws, and
   the birth step rewrites with [decide_True] at [PipeDisc.disc_p_nil]. *)

(* HartLift.v -- the per-node proof-interface kit, item 1: the reflective
   silent stepper and the batched WP rule.

   Design: claude-notes/design/main-cycle-port.md §5.  THE SEMANTICS IS
   PER-NODE AND STAYS THAT WAY (settled decision recorded there): batching a
   stretch of silent nodes into one rule application is a THEOREM, proven
   here once, not a coarsening of [prim_step].  Pattern source: the weak
   branch's WeakEvLift.v §3-§4 (measured at the spike; carried over shape
   for shape, minus all weak-memory content).

   THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS TO ENFORCE (spike finding F8, MANDATORY):
   **no call site ever writes a residual monad down.**  A batched rule
   taking the equation [hrun_silent n D rs m = (rs', m')] forces the caller
   to NAME [m'] -- a Sail continuation whose readback normalises the rest of
   the instruction symbolically (measured on the spike: did not finish in
   110 s, against 0.1 s for the same run projected to a number).  So the
   interface is a CURSOR [hcur = regstate * M unit] with TOTAL functions
   ([hsil], [hcur_read], [hcur_write], [hcur_loop]) -- a certification is a
   chain of applications, never normalised -- plus TOTAL PROJECTIONS with
   small outputs ([hnode_tag] : a number; the request records) and
   once-proven inversion lemmas by which rules match the residual's head.

   THE FOOTPRINT [D].  Every register a stretch touches must lie in a
   declared [gset register] footprint, because that is where the caller's
   ownership lives ([hreg_frame]).  Two boundaries fall out structurally
   rather than by discipline (design doc §5, the settled note):
     - [sig_seip] sits at [DfracOwn 1] inside [WireInv.wire_inv], so no
       caller can put it in a frame -- a stretch reading the wire makes the
       batch rule inapplicable, which is exactly right: [plic_step] writes
       it cross-thread ([RiscvLang.prim_step_hart_regs_frame] is the licence
       lemma: it is the ONLY cross-thread register write).
     - the [MinstretInv] cells (minstret, minstret_increment, mcycle,
       mtime, mip) live in invariants; nodes touching them take single-node
       rules that open the invariant around exactly that step.

   TWO DELIBERATE RESTRICTIONS, matching cuts the tree already makes:
     - [Choose] is EXCLUDED: with it, the successor is not determined by
       the pre-state and a functional stepper cannot exist.  [exec] already
       treats [Choose] as stuck, so certified paths contain none.
     - [Barrier] is SILENT here -- at SC a fence is semantically inert
       ([mnode_step] says so).  This is a DELTA against the weak branch's
       stepper, where fences move views and are events; the weak port pulls
       [Barrier] back out of the silent class, which is a change inside
       this file's successor, not in the language. *)

(* THE VIEW EFFECT OF A SILENT NODE (tso-machine-flip.md §2).  Every node
   [hsil_node] accepts leaves the memory-model state alone EXCEPT ONE: under
   Ztso a BARRIER with a W→R edge DRAINS, and [mnode_step]'s arm takes the
   view to [fence_post].  So the silent stretch can no longer PIN the view;
   it CARRIES it, and [wp_hsil_node] below pays the (monotone) view update
   for a draining fence.

   WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it does not mint a [hart_view_lb] receipt.  §6's
   barrier leaf is a SEPARATE rule over the same node, for the proof that
   wants the acquire receipt; keeping [Barrier] silent here is what keeps
   every existing silent-stretch proof (which walks over fences it does not
   care about) working unchanged.  See the §6 amendments in

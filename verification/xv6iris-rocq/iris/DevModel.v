(* THE BOARD HAS TWO 16550 PORTS, and everything about a UART below is
   INDEXED BY WHICH.  [Uart0] is the one at 0x1000_0000 that every board
   profile has; [Uart1] is the second port the QEMU virt machine
   instantiates at 0x1000_a000 when a second serial backend is attached
   (`qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt ... -serial <a> -serial <b>`;
   tools/vtest/vtest.py's `uarts=2` knob).  The two ports are IDENTICAL
   CHIPS -- the same [uart_state], the same [uart_read]/[uart_write], the
   same autonomous transitions -- and differ only in the two board facts
   below, the window they answer and the PLIC source they drive.  So
   nothing about the 16550 is written twice: the index is a parameter of
   the fabric, never of the chip.

   more interrupts, never fewer.)

   -- the last queued byte leaves, or an FCR write clears the FIFO -- and
   when IER bit 1 is written while it is already idle, since there is no
   later edge to arm it then.  It is CLEARED by a THR write (the transmitter

(* NOTE (deliberate, load-bearing): there is NO general monotonicity lemma for
   [uart_write].  An FCR write (offset 2) with bit 2 set CLEARS the tx FIFO,
   which in general SHRINKS [uart_acc] -- the queued bytes are discarded, never
   sent -- so an invariant holding a monotone [uart_acc] ghost forbids it.
   xv6's [uartinit] performs exactly that write (FCR_FIFO_CLEAR = bits 1|2),
   and is verifiable anyway, because a proof that OWNS the transmitter can show
   the FIFO empty at the write ([uart_write_2_stable] below, whose [u_tx u = []]
   premise comes from [uart_tx_empty_of_out]) -- and a clear of an empty FIFO
   shrinks nothing.  What stays forbidden is a FIFO-clearing write by code that
   cannot prove the FIFO empty. *)

(* -- CONFIG WRITES: which of the three tracked quantities each offset moves --

   The three quantities the UART ghosts track are [uart_acc], [u_out] and
   [uart_dlab] (see WpUart.v's [uart_ghosts]).  A leaf-level device store hands
   its caller a [uart_write u off b = Some u'] equation and asks for the ghosts
   back at [u']; the four lemmas below are what turn that equation into
   "nothing moved" (or, for the LCR, "exactly DLAB moved"), one per offset the
   16550 init sequence writes.  Together with [uart_write_out] they cover every
   offset [uartinit] touches: 1 (IER/DLM), 0 with DLAB set (DLL), 3 (LCR) and
   2 (FCR). *)

   the owner may perform one.  Then the FIFO is still empty at that later
   point: the device can only have moved bytes from [u_tx] to [u_out], and
   [u_out] has already reached [l], so there is nothing left to move.

   This is what makes "polled THRE, therefore the write will not be dropped"
   sound in the presence of a concurrently draining device and other harts. *)

(* The same conclusion phrased at ONE state: if the accepted trace is [l] and
   [l] has already all been transmitted, the FIFO is empty.  This is the form a
   THR write uses -- it needs no witness of an earlier polled state, only what
   the transmitter token ([uart_acc u = l]) and the carried [uart_out_lb l]
   ([l `prefix_of` u_out u]) give at the write's OWN state. *)

(* SysMknodDefs.v -- the mknod/create family's PURE VOCABULARY LEAF: the
   device-number reading of a syscall argument, the abstract child
   [FsAbsCreateFire.create_made] leaves behind, and nameiparent's hop-name
   family.  It re-exports [FsAbsDelta], so every consumer of the create
   delta and its row algebra sees the same names through this file.

   Definitions and small pure lemmas only -- no contract, no walk, no
   [Module Type].  sys_mknod's ONE contract is [SpecSysMknod]'s
   [SYSMKNOD]; the commits the bundle carries are [FsAbsCreateFire]'s
   authority-shaped family, re-exported by [FsAbsMknodFire].

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 0-5
   ("ONE CONTRACT PER SYSCALL") and section 7's mknod row.  The abstract
   vocabulary is FsAbs.v: [anode]/[abs_of], [aview], [nview],
   [astate Γ av], [apath_at].

   ==== THE DELTA, AND THE FRESHNESS SHAPE ==============================

   [delta_create d nm i c av] (FsAbsDelta, re-exported) is the fused
   delta, type-parameterized in the child's [absnode] [c] so mkdir ([ADir]
   with dots, parent bump) and open(O_CREATE) ([AFile []]) reuse it
   verbatim; [acre_bump] is the mkdir-only parent-nlink increment, fused
   as the design asks.

   The design sketch writes the success arm as [exists i not in dom av].
   That is NOT statable over the landed [astate]: the gtop authority
   carries a row for EVERY inum of the region (free records read as bare
   nodes), so [dom av] is the whole region and no inum is ever outside it.
   The honest per-instant condition -- and the one the machine realizes --
   is [cre_pre]'s third conjunct: at the fire instant the row at [i]
   ALREADY reads as the freshly-minted child ([MkAnode c 1], the orphan
   create built before dirlink runs).  Under that observation the fused
   delta COLLAPSES to the one-row parent insert ([delta_create_dev] --
   [insert_id] on the child's row), which is why ONE ghost move at ONE
   instant realizes it: the fire point is dirlink's successful entry
   write, the only retag the delta needs.

   What the success arm therefore does NOT claim is "i was free at the
   start of the call".  Its freshness content is: the child's row reads
   [ADev ma mi] at nlink 1 at the instant, and the parent's entry map did
   not contain [nm].  A client that needs "i is none of MY nodes" gets it
   from agreement: its own pinned values are visible in the SAME [av], so
   any pinned node whose value differs from the child's is not [i].

   ==== THE HOP-NAME FAMILY ============================================

   [npar_elems pl = removelast (path_elems pl)] covers the PARENT
   PREFIX only: create resolves with nameiparent, which fires dirlookup on
   every element but the last; the LAST element is the created NAME, tied
   in the post arms by [last (path_elems pl) = Some nm] (SpecNamex's bname
   ruling makes the tie provable).  It is the family the era nameiparent
   walk ranges over ([FsAbsNpar.np_elems] is the same function), and
   unlink, open and create all state their walks over it.

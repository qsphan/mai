   ==== THE nlink GUARD, AND WHAT IT DOES TO THE DECODE BELOW (9da28f5) ====

   The `if (dp->nlink == 0)` above is upstream `9da28f5`'s second guard
   (`kernel-defects.md` D2; namex has the twin, and `ProofNamex` walks it).
   It grew create from 312 bytes to **332** and it moved every offset in the
   listing below, so:

   **THE DECODE BLOCK THAT FOLLOWS IS AT PRE-9da28f5 OFFSETS AND MUST BE
   REGENERATED BEFORE ANY WALK.**  It is kept because its FIVE structural
   findings are all still true (four dirlink call sites for three source
   calls; `dp->nlink++` last; create never stores `ip->type`; one register
   carries the answer; a0 is not reloaded before either ilock).  What moved:
   the register allocation (the answer now lives in s2, not s3) and every
   address from the prologue on.  Read `CodeCreate.v`, not this comment.

   What IS verified against the regenerated `CodeCreate.v` at this revision:

     +0x00  c.addi16sp -80                   FRAME STILL 80 BYTES / 10 SLOTS
            (0x715d), and **SEVEN** callee-saves in the prologue --
            ra 72, s0 64, s1 56, s2 48, s4 32, s5 24, s6 16.  SLOT 40 IS
            s3's AND THE PROLOGUE DOES NOT WRITE IT: the [c.sdsp s3,40(sp)]
            is at +0x8a, i.e. on the ALLOCATE HALF ONLY, and it is reloaded
            per-arm (+0xd0 C-OK, +0xdc A-FAIL, +0x144 FAIL) rather than by
            the shared epilogue, which restores the same seven.  s3 is
            therefore callee-saved on ARMS N / G / F-BAD / F-OK for the
            trivial reason that they never write it.
     +0x1c  jal nameiparent  / +0x20 mv s1,a0 (dp) / +0x22 beqz -> ARM N
     +0x26  jal ilock                        (a0 still dp)
     +0x2a  lh  a5,74(s1)                    dp->nlink                 [GUARD]
     +0x2e  c.beqz a5 -> +0x76               [ARM G, the guard's exit]
     +0x30  li a2,0 / addi a1,s0,-80 / mv a0,s1 / +0x38 jal dirlookup
     +0x62  mv a0,s2                         THE EPILOGUE FUNNEL, s2 = answer
     +0x76  mv a0,s1 / +0x78 jal iunlockput (dp) / +0x7c li s2,0
     +0x7e  c.j +0x62                        (the epilogue funnel)

   **ARM G IS A MEMBER OF THE ok = false FAMILY, AND THE CONTRACT ALREADY
   ADMITS IT** -- this is the whole reason `wp_create_sconf_body` does not
   move for the fix.  Its exit is `iunlockput(dp); return 0`, i.e. ARM N's
   payload one call later, so the failure arm's "a0 = 0 and create holds
   nothing -- every inode it touched has been iunlockput" is literally true
   of it; the slot ledger is untouched (nameiparent spends two and returns
   one, the `iunlockput` returns the second, so `ns' = ns`, well inside
   `ns - create_slots <= ns' <= ns`); `Sb` grows and `u` falls only by
   whatever flush the `iput` inside `iunlockput` runs, which is exactly what
   `Sb ⊆ Sb'` / `u' <= u` were written for.  The failure family is therefore
   **N / G / F-BAD / A-FAIL / FAIL**, five arms where the text below says
   four.  Design: `fs-icache.md` §20.17 step 1.

   The guard's DECISION is `ProofNamex`'s at +0xce/+0xd2 verbatim -- the
   halfword comes out of the `i_nlink` conjunct of `ic_loaded`'s
   `inode_meta`, and `sign_extend' 64` is injective on `mword 16`, so the
   `c.beqz` decides `di_nlink dn = 0` exactly (`ProofNamexParts.nx_nlz_eq` /
   `nx_nlz_ne`, hoisted there by stage B' precisely so both walkers can
   name them).  The FALL-THROUGH is the interesting half: it hands the walk
   `bv_unsigned (di_nlink dn) <> 0` at the SAME `dn` that `ic_loaded` names
   in its `dinode_at` and quantifies its `dlinks` over -- which is the
   raw material §20.17's step 4/5 consume.

   Inode field offsets in play: dev @ +0, inum @ +4, type @ +68, major
   @ +70, minor @ +72, nlink @ +74.

   FIVE THINGS THE C SKETCH DOES NOT SHOW, all verified against the decode:

   1. **FOUR dirlink call sites for THREE source calls.**  The compiler
      DUPLICATED `dirlink(dp, name, ip->inum)` into the two arms of the
      `type == T_DIR` test (+0xb4 for the non-directory, +0x102 for the
      directory) so that the second `if(type == T_DIR)` needs no re-test.
   2. **`dp->nlink++` and `iupdate(dp)` come LAST** (+0x10a..+0x116), after
      every dirlink has succeeded -- not before the `.`/`..` links as in
      the older xv6.  So NO cleanup arm ever has to undo the parent's link
      count, and the `fail:` arm touches only the CHILD's.
   3. **create never stores `ip->type`.**  +68 is READ once (+0x50, the
      found arm) and never written: the type is installed on DISK by
      `ialloc`, and reaches memory through ilock's fill.  This is the
      whole reason [SpecIalloc.ialloc_fresh] exists -- and the reason for
      the ONE open item recorded below.
   4. **s3 carries the answer, and the two `return 0` arms at +0xc6 and
      +0x132 never re-zero it.**  They are 0 because control reached them
      only through the +0x3c `c.beqz` (dirlookup missed), whose +0x3a
      `mv s3,a0` already stored 0.  `s3 = 0` is a live invariant across
      the whole +0x80..+0x132 region.
   5. **a0 is NOT reloaded before the ilock at +0x2a nor the one at
      +0x8c**: it is the live return value of nameiparent / ialloc.

   ==== THE RETURN IS A *LOCKED* INODE ====================================

   Both success arms return with the child's SLEEPLOCK STILL HELD and its
   entry CHECKED OUT -- create is the only fs.c function that does.  So
   this contract's success payout is, verbatim, [SpecIunlock]'s /
   [SpecIunlockput]'s PRECONDITION:

     is_sleeplock .. ∗ sleeplocked_q .. pidv ∗ ic_deposit ∗
     i_dev/i_inum halves ∗ i_valid ↦ true ∗ ic_loaded ∗ ity_shot ∗
     inode_ref_short_gen k (qi + s) qi dev inum g

   i.e. exactly what sys_open must present to `iunlock(ip)` before it
   parks the inode in the file struct, and what sys_mkdir / sys_mknod
   present to `iunlockput(ip)`.  The reference is the RETAINED PARENT of
   the share the deposit holds: [IcacheRef.inode_ref_gather] re-forms the
   canonical reference the caller later spends.

   IT IS GENERATION-NAMED, AND AT THE *SAME* [g] AS THE DEPOSIT AND THE
   [ity_shot].  Erasing the name here cost nothing to the two callers that
   only [iunlockput] (they weaken it back with
   [IcacheRef.inode_ref_short_gen_forget], one line), and it BLOCKED the
   one that does not: [FileInvDefs.inode_pay_alloc] wants
   [inode_shr_held_gen v Q g] and [ity_shot g ty] AT ONE [g], and sys_open's
   O_CREATE arm has no other route to that name -- its else arm keeps the
   gen-named parent across its own [ilock], and this arm cannot, because
   the name was thrown away inside create.  The general rule: a payout
   that already names a generation in one conjunct must not erase it in
   another, because no consumer can put it back.

   ==== THE OP-WIDE SET (fs-icache.md section 18 clause 1) ================

   create is section 18's named consumer: ONE begin_op..end_op around the
   whole body lives in the CALLER (sys_open / sys_mkdir / sys_mknod), and
   create threads ONE [LogInv.log_opS] across ialloc + iupdate x3 +
   dirlink x4 (+ the writei and iupdate inside each dirlink).  The op's
   DISTINCT-BLOCK set is at most SIX, whatever the counted per-call sums
   say:

     IBLOCK(ip)   ialloc's claim, ip's iupdate, and the iupdate inside
                  each dirlink on ip
     IBLOCK(dp)   dp's nlink++ iupdate and the iupdate inside dirlink(dp)
     bmapstart    the one bitmap block (bitmap_geom_ok's 0 < size <= BPB)
     ip's block 0 the new directory's first data block ("." and "..")
     dp's block   the block holding the new entry
     dp's indirect  only when the parent is past NDIRECT blocks

   against MAXOPBLOCKS = 10.  The counted sum is far past it (4 x
   dirlink_units = 28 alone), which is exactly why the seam is SET FORM.
   The arm-by-arm ledger, and the two callee retrofits it needs, are in
   projects/fs-sysfile.md's S5a section.

   The postcondition offers [Sb ⊆ Sb'] and [u' <= u] and NO CEILING on
   [Sb' ∖ Sb]: S3l's finding is that no obligation anywhere consumes a
   ceiling (callers claim MEMBERSHIPS), and a ceiling here would have to
   name loop-carried block maps.  Budget soundness rides the counter --
   [LogInv.log_spend_step] refuses to grow [Sb] without spending.

   THE FLOOR ON [u'] IS OFFERED ONLY AT [ok = true], AND THAT GUARD IS
   FORCED.  The success arms hand back a LOCKED inode, so their caller
   must run its own [iunlockput] before [end_op] -- sys_mkdir at +0x2e and
   sys_mknod at +0x46 both do -- and [wp_iunlockput_*] wants [iput_units]
   in hand.  Nothing between create's return and that call mints a unit,
   so without this clause neither walk can reach its own [iunlockput].
   (The superseded justification here read "create's caller runs [end_op],
   which takes [log_op] at ANY count".  That describes the LAST call those
   callers make, not the one before it.)

   The failure arms owe nothing of the kind -- they hold no inode -- and
   they could not pay it: create's [fail:] tail runs TWO [iunlockput]s and
   the second, on the PARENT, is entered with neither [cru] nor [crz],
   because no route into [fail:] has logged [IBLOCK dp].  [dl16_post]'s
   membership trio is guarded on [0 < tot] and every route into [fail:]
   has [tot = 0]; SpecDirlink's own header explains why that guard is
   forced rather than inherited.  So the call spends one whatever it
   reports, and [CreateBudget.cr_budget_fail_late] -- which prices the arm
   at [ip_need <= u7 /\ u7 = 3] -- says that call can RUN, not that three
   survive it.  Two survive, and an unconditional floor would be false.

   ==== THE ONE OPEN ITEM, STATED HONESTLY ================================

   The `made = true` arm claims [di_type dn = ty].  create does not write
   the type (decode fact 3), so that identity has to arrive from ialloc's
   claim through ilock's THIRD FILL ARM -- and today's [SpecIlock]
   postcondition binds [dn] EXISTENTIALLY, so it does not.  Without it
   the mkdir path cannot even call [dirlink(ip, ".")], whose first
   premise is [di_type dn = T_DIR].  The repair (an additive
   [wp_ilock_fresh] fed by a half-fragment claim receipt out of
   [InodeRegion]) is designed and sized in projects/fs-sysfile.md's S5a
   section; this contract states the TRUE post-state and the proof stage
   inherits the retrofit.  Nothing else in this file depends on it.

   create SLEEPS everywhere, so it threads the full running-process
   bundle and takes the parking premise.  It enters and returns at
   noff 0. *)

     create is the one function whose child is MID-BUILT across a call: a

     entries only at the interior [dirlink]s, and in between it is a
     directory with a link count and no dots -- exactly what
     [FsStateInode.inode_local] rules out.  So create SUSPENDS that inode's
     row for the window ([InodeRegion.ireg_arm]), which parks this token,
     and hands it back at the disarm.  Every other walk in the tree leaves
     its inode well-formed at each write and needs none of this.
     THE TOKEN COMES BACK ON EVERY ARM: create's caller ends the operation,
     and end_op takes the whole [LogInv.log_op]. *)

(* ArrCursor.v -- the strided array cursor that an initializer loop walks, and
   the two pure facts such a loop needs about it.

   Every "initialize each element of a global array" loop in the kernel --
   binit over bcache.buf[], iinit over itable.inode[] -- keeps a pointer
   register stepping by the element stride and stops when it reaches a
   precomputed end pointer one past the last element.  [acur base stride i] is
   that pointer at element [i]; [acur_step] is the loop's [addi cur,cur,stride]
   and [acur_neq] turns its [bne cur,end] test into the index comparison
   [i =? n], which is what the fuel induction runs on.

   Stated over an arbitrary base/stride (no no-wrap assumption beyond the one
   the compare genuinely needs) rather than per array, so a new array-walking
   loop reuses it instead of re-deriving the bitvector arithmetic. *)

(* the cursor at element [i] of an array of [stride]-byte elements based at
   [base]; [acur base stride n] is the loop's end pointer for [n] elements. *)

  mword_of_int (base + stride * Z.of_nat i).

(* the loop's pointer bump.  [o] is the increment as the instruction spells it
   (a sign-extended 12-bit immediate at the use site), passed as a premise so
   the caller discharges the widening by [vm_compute] on its own literal. *)

(* [mword_of_int] is [Z_to_bv], so its value is the wrapped literal.  (The same
   identity is proved inside [WpMemsetS]'s Iris section as [moi64_unsigned]; this
   file is deliberately Iris-free, so it carries its own copy rather than
   pulling a whole WP file in for one bitvector fact.) *)

(* the cursor's numeric value: in range for every index the loop visits,

(* the loop's exit test.  Both cursors are in range (the array does not wrap),

(* the cursor is injective on the indices a loop visits: distinct elements of
   the array are distinct addresses.  ([acur_neq] gives this for the end
   pointer; this is the general form, used to keep the per-element resources

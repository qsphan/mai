(* PrintkArgs.v -- the vocabulary a CALLER of printk speaks: how it describes
   its varargs, what resource each description costs, where the ABI puts them,
   and the address of pr.lock.

   Split out of SpecPrintk.v because it is not about printk's weakest
   precondition at all -- it is the shared language in which printk's callers
   state their obligations, and panic (SpecPanic.v) needs it while sitting
   BELOW printk's spec in the dependency order.  SpecPrintk.v [Require Export]s
   this file, so nothing that used these names through it changes.

   A variadic call has no types at the call site, so the caller DESCRIBES its
   arguments: [descs] says, for each vararg in order, whether it is an
   integer-ish value ([PkANum] -- %d/%u/%x/%p/%c and the long forms), a null
   [char *] ([PkANull], which printk prints as "(null)"), or a [char *] to a
   string it owns ([PkAStr dq s]).  The description must MATCH the format
   string --

       pk_kinds f = map pk_desc_kind descs

   -- which is the honest statement of C's unchecked contract: a "%s" whose
   argument is not a string is undefined behaviour, and here it is simply
   unprovable. *)

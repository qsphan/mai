   WHAT IS HERE.  The application's DATA and every obligation of
   [App.xv6_app_adequacy] that is provable without any of the lanes:

     the DISCIPLINE [disc]      -- every power cycle's input bytes so far
                                   parse as admissible lines
                                   ([EchoDisc.disc_input]); decidable,
                                   prefix-closed, and unmoved by output
                                   bytes and power events;
     the FIXED PART [echo_cl]   -- the taint counter's name, born once at
                                   0 by [echo_birth] (app-instances.md
                                   section 6 ruling 1, round D0: what used
                                   to be the machine's client counter is
                                   this application's own);
     the LEDGER [echo_R]        -- that counter at 0 while the input keeps
                                   the discipline and at 1 from the first
                                   byte that breaks it, so the counter at
                                   0 IS "untainted" and its lower bound at
                                   1 is the taint;
     its four steps             -- birth, the power arm, the tx arm, the
                                   rx arm ([echo_R_alloc] -- exactly the
                                   theorem's [HR0], out of [echo_cl] --
                                   [echo_R_pow], [echo_R_tx], [echo_R_rx]),
                                   each a basic update over the ledger
                                   alone: the theorem's wands frame the
                                   UART ghosts around them;
     the PREDICATE [echo_pred]  -- TAINTED OR PINNED: either the taint
                                   ([echo_taint], the ledger counter's
                                   lower bound at 1) or the binaries are
                                   the image's -- the era-0 pins of /init,
                                   /sh and /echo ([FsInitPinBoot.era0_pins],
                                   [FsShPin.era0_sh_pins],
                                   [FsEchoPin.era0_echo_pins]) read on the
                                   abstract state's VIEW ([FsAbsDefs.aview],
                                   app-instances.md round A).  The taint
                                   arm is what makes the claim SUPPLIABLE
                                   after the console discipline breaks
                                   (app-echo.md "ARM-c"): [echo_taint ⊢
                                   app_sup_raw (echo_pred γ) r], which no
                                   closed hypothesis proves;
     the BOOT obligation AT ERA 0 -- the founded map satisfies the pins
                                   when the disk is the mkfs image
                                   ([echo_fs_era0], [echo_init]), and at
                                   the theorem's own literal shape
                                   ([echo_init_img]);
     the RECORD [app_echo]      -- the [App.xv6_app] value, with every
                                   hypothesis of [App.xv6_app_adequacy] but
                                   [Hinit_boot] and [Hphi] discharged as a
                                   lemma at its fields.

   WHAT AN APPLICATION OWES, and what echo can pay.  The obligations of
   [App.xv6_app_adequacy] are [Hbirth], [Happ_xfer], [Happ_init],
   [Hinit_boot], the trace ledger's five and [Hphi] -- there is no parked
   license any more, and no SUPPLY either, and those two retirements are
   what make a CONSTRAINING application an instance at all: the blanket
   promise admitted every one-row move, which no pin survives, and the
   supply says the claim is trivially true, which [taint ∨ pins] is only
   after the taint is minted.

   THE ONE OPEN HYPOTHESIS, and which lane closes it.  Every other
   hypothesis of [App.xv6_app_adequacy] is a lemma in section 6 below, at
   the theorem's own binder with [A := app_echo].  The one that is not
   ([Hphi]'s entry is kept for the record: it was open until lane ECHO-OUT
   part 5):

     [Hinit_boot] -- LANE E2 (ARM-c (1b), INIT-BOOT).  Echo's own PINNED
       exec bundle at "/init": [PinnedExec.pinned_exec_bundle] over the
       era-0 pins, with [UInitKernel.init_slot_of_kexec] as the slot piece
       and the taint arm paid by [echo_sup_of_taint].  Mirrors [UInitSh],
       which is the same construction at /sh.
     [Hphi] -- CLOSED (lane ECHO-OUT part 5).  [echo_phi] is the real
       conclusion -- if the input kept the discipline for the whole run,
       every power cycle's output is a prefix of the console stream its
       input calls for ([EchoDisc.good_out]) -- and the obligation is read
       off the LEDGER by [echo_R_phi]/[echo_Hphi_R] here and discharged at
       [UInitBootAdequacy], which is where the adequacy literal lives.

   WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a theorem.  [Hphi] at the placeholder
   would go through, but [Hinit_boot] is open, and a theorem taking it as
   a hypothesis would be durable-notes.md's GAP-premise trap -- so the
   application is a DEFINITION with its obligations as free-standing
   lemmas, and the two above are the worklist. *)

  (* ...AND WHAT THE KEY BECOMES WHEN /init's MKNOD FAILS: THE SEAL.
     app-echo.md, lane SH-OPEN's finding -- sh's own console preamble has
     to be able to prove ITS first [open] misses, and sh cannot hold the
     key (it is exclusive, and it would have to cross init's [box]-ed exec
     supply).  So on the repair arm's failure /init SPENDS the key into
     the claim: the key's own name is advanced from [[]] to [[0]], the
     AUTHORITY at [[0]] goes into a fourth, SEALED-ABSENT arm of
     [cons_state], and the LOWER BOUND at [[0]] -- persistent -- is handed
     out as [cons_never].

     WHY THE SEAL LIVES AT THE KEY'S NAME [r.2] AND NOT AT THE FLAG'S
     [r.1] AT A SENTINEL INUM: a sentinel in the flag would have to be
     refuted against the PRESENT arms, whose inum is existential and which
     nothing constrains to be non-negative, so "the sentinel is not an
     inum" is not provable.  At the key's name it is one exclusion and no
     arithmetic: every PRESENT arm holds [cons_key r = ●ML []] at [r.2],
     and a lower bound at [[0]] does not compose with it.

     ABSENCE IS STABLE UNDER THE SEAL because law (f) -- the only step
     that puts the console under `console` at the root -- DEMANDS the key,
     and after the seal nobody holds one.  A power cycle does not inherit
     the seal: the transport mints a FRESH key for the clone at every
     view whose [cons_inum] is [[]], so a sealed era does not seal the

(* THE CONCLUSION, at last: if the console input kept the discipline for the
   WHOLE run, then every power cycle emitted, on the CONSOLE's wire, a
   PREFIX of the session transcript that cycle's input calls for
   ([EchoDisc.good_out]) -- and nothing else, because the kernel's own
   messages go to the other UART.  It was [True] until 2026-09-12, and at
   [True] the whole theorem said SAFETY AND NOTHING ELSE.

   THE GUARD IS THE WHOLE HISTORY'S, NOT THE CYCLE'S (the owner's ruling,
   lane ECHO-OUT part 5: "there's no per-cycle form -- once we get taint in
   one era, it's tainted forever").  Until part 5 this was the PER-CYCLE
   form [Forall (fun seg => disc_seg' seg -> good_out seg) (cycles_of h)],
   which the ledger cannot pay: the taint is a run-wide monotone counter,
   so what the ledger holds is "the input was disciplined THROUGHOUT, or
   the taint" -- and that is exactly the implication below
   ([EchoOut.echo_led_phi]).

   [App.app_phi] takes the operational state as well; echo's conclusion
   reads only the trace, so the state argument is dropped -- the durable
   half of the claim is [echo_pred] in the crash slot, not here.

   THE OBLIGATION IS CLOSED (lane ECHO-OUT part 5).  [App.xv6_app_adequacy]'s
   [Hphi] is discharged at [UInitBootAdequacy] from [echo_R_phi] above, via
   [RiscvAdequacy.obs_ledger_at_phi]: the ledger is a pure reading, so the

     THIS IS THE STATEMENT LANE TL-8 REFUTED, and what changed is not the
     token count but where the tokens may be spent.  The node is handed
     the round's credential ([UkInit.init_lend_cred]) and its conclusion
     is an UPDATE now, so the credential can be turned into the taint
     INSIDE the node: the console row reads it ([UInitTree.tree_cc_wp]),
     the closed row MINTS it ([UInitTree.tree_cc_wbn_mint] -- the row where
     the banner was never written, so the era's licence is still unspent),
     and the taint arm hands it over.  [UInitTree.tree_lend_taint] is all
     three, and the lend it gives back is what the deposit's REFUND still
     needs ([UkInit.init_lend_ref]) -- which is why the mint had to run
     here and not before the node.

     WHAT IT COSTS THE ERA: nothing that the dance does not already pay.
     The taint is persistent once minted, so the [box] over this supply
     re-derives it per round from whatever credential that round carries;
     and on the rounds where the banner HAS run the credential is already
     the taint and the mint does not fire at all. *)

  (* ...AND THE PAYLOAD THE SLOT IS SPENT AT.  Six conjuncts, and only TWO
     of them cost the era anything: the console dance and the banner-owed
     credential [cc_wbn 0].  The banner law and the two diagnostics are
     [UInitTree]'s, off the deposits, and the read credential is [True].

     ONLY ONE OF THE TWO COSTS A LICENCE NOW (lane TL-9), and that is what
     retires TL-8's wall (section 9.7(4)).  The dance is taken AS TL-7
     LANDED IT, at [Cns := True] ([UInitTreeBoot.tree_init_cons_dance_all]),
     whose linear credential is the era's DEED and not the taint -- so the
     era's single licence ([AppTree.tree_licence_mint], one row per
     power-on) goes where the design always said it goes: into [cc_wbn 0],
     the banner-owed credential, which is what makes the banner the mint
     (section 9.5(3)).  [UInitTree.tree_cc_wbn_of_turn] is the one step. *)

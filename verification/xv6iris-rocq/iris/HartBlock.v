(* HartBlock.v -- THE SOLO-BLOCK BRACKET.

   [RiscvLang.mnode_step] steps a hart ONE Sail-monad node at a time; the
   pre-port machine ran a WHOLE instruction ([RiscvLang.run (riscv_step
   tick)]) in one step.  This file relates the two: a CONTIGUOUS run of node
   steps, boundary to boundary and with NO INTERFERENCE, is exactly one old
   [run].

   WHAT IT IS FOR.  Every certification in the tree -- the [exec_*] catalogue,
   the decode bridge, the per-instruction interpreter-run facts the leaves are
   proven with -- is a fact about [run]/[exec] over a whole instruction.  The
   bracket is what lets the adapter that rebuilds the whole-instruction WP
   CONSUME those facts unchanged instead of re-deriving them node by node.  It
   is the SC analogue of an interpreter/LTS bracket, and it is pure: no Iris.

   DIRECTION.  Only the SOUND direction (block => run) is proven here, and it
   is the unconditional one: whatever the new machine does in a solo block,
   the old machine also did.  The converse (run => block) is deliberately not
   stated here; its honest witness is the language's own functional
   interpreter (the reflective stepper), and it belongs with that stepper.

   INTERFERENCE.  "No interference" is not a hypothesis of any lemma below --
   it is built into the shape: [mblock] chains [mnode_step] on ONE hart's
   [mstate] with NO OTHER HART'S RESERVATION in force ([oth = ∅], design
   §3a), so there is nowhere for another thread's effect to enter and no
   self-loop arm is ever enabled.  The hart's OWN reservation is threaded
   existentially: with nobody else reserving, it changes what the memory arms
   RECORD but never what they DO, so [run] -- which has no reservation --
   is reached regardless.  A caller in the logic earns that shape by owning
   what the block reads.

   THE TSO PORT (tso-machine-flip.md RULING 3).  [run] and [exec] STAY FLAT:
   they read [s.(mem)], the flat cache.  Post-flip that is no longer what
   every read arm of [mnode_step] does -- the PLAIN EXPLICIT RAM LOAD reads
   [tso_read img log h tv'] at a nondeterministically advanced view -- so the
   bracket is no longer unconditionally true, and RULING 3 says to re-prove
   it under whichever premise the proof actually needs.  IT NEEDS TWO, both
   about the era the block runs in, and both discharged per step:

     [c.2.(mem) = flat img log]   the FLAT TIE -- [RiscvLang.mm_ok]'s first
                                  conjunct, i.e. the machine invariant, so
                                  it is free at every reachable state;
     [all_own h log]              the SOLO ERA -- every message in the log is
                                  this hart's own.

   Together they are exactly [TsoMemPa.tso_read_all_own]: the sole author of
   the log sees all of it at EVERY view (own-always-visible IS store
   forwarding), so its plain load reads the flat cache no matter where the
   arm's nondeterministic drain put the view, and the arm folds back onto
   [run]'s [s.(mem)] read.  The alternative premise RULING 3 offers -- "the
   run touches no plain RAM data loads" -- would also do, and is STRICTLY
   STRONGER here: it would exclude every load-bearing instruction, whereas
   the solo era excludes only concurrency.  The solo era is the boot
   bracket's and the device-conformance tester's actual situation, which is
   what the bracket exists to serve.

   WHY PER STEP AND NOT THREADED.  Both ties are stated inside [mstep1]'s
   existential rather than as parameters of [mblock], which makes the bracket
   the WEAKEST statement: a chain only has to be a chain of good steps, and
   nothing forces the same [log] on two neighbours.  A caller that has the
   ties at the block's START gets them at every step for free -- the flat tie
   by [RiscvLang.mnode_step_mm] and the solo era by
   [TsoMemPa.all_own_app] (the only arm that appends is the RAM write, and
   it appends [PWMsg _ h]), which is [mnode_step_all_own] below. *)

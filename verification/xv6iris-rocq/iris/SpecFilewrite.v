   308 bytes.  fileread's four arms plus a LOOP, and the loop is the whole
   difference: each iteration is its own log transaction, so [begin_op] and
   [end_op] bracket every chunk and the reservation is minted and spent
   inside the body rather than threaded across the call.

   ==== DECODE FACTS THIS CONTRACT IS STATED AGAINST ====================

   Read off the tracked dump; the four that a reader of the C would get
   wrong are recorded in claude-notes/projects/fs-sysfile.md (S3a's list):

   1. The [!writable] return at +0x00/+0x04 is BEFORE THE PROLOGUE, so its
      [ret] at +0x124 runs with sp untouched.  Nothing in the frame exists
      on that path, which is why this contract's environment must already
      contain everything the postcondition promises.
   2. [devsw[major].write] is at OFFSET 8 -- [.read] is the first of the two
      function pointers -- so the device arm's cell is [devsw + 16*mj + 8]
      and is NOT [SpecFileread.a_devsw_read].
   3. [panic("filewrite")] at +0x11e is the ELSE arm (the type is none of
      FD_PIPE / FD_DEVICE / FD_INODE), exactly like fileread's.  It is NOT a
      short-write panic: a short write [break]s the loop at +0xc0 and the
      tail at +0xf4 answers -1.
   4. [max = ((MAXOPBLOCKS-1-1-2)/2)*BSIZE = 3072], materialised TWICE
      ([lui]/[addi] into s7 and s9) at +0x42..+0x4e.

   ==== WHAT THE FD_INODE ARM NEEDS THAT FILEREAD DID NOT ===============

   (a) THE TYPE WITNESS (design fs-icache.md §17, closed by §17.6/§17.7 after
   five iterations).  The arm re-parks [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded], whose
   [DirView.dir_ok] conjunct constrains a DIRECTORY's data bytes -- and an
   arbitrary user write into a directory breaks [dir_inums_ok].  writei
   cannot change [di_type], and the record is ilock's OUTPUT, so "not a
   directory" cannot be a premise about a caller-held record.  The real xv6
   invariant is five frames up: sys_open refuses writable directory fds.

   It crosses as a resource.  The lent share is GENERATION-NAMED
   ([IcacheRef.inode_shr_gen] at [fwn_g]); SpecIlock's postcondition hands
   back [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot fwn_g (di_type dn)] at that same generation
   (pinned by [live_gen_agree], with no itable fact anywhere); this contract
   carries the fd's own [ity_shot fwn_g fwn_ty] with [fwn_ty <> T_DIR];
   [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot_agree] joins them and [DirView.dir_ok_not_dir]
   finishes.  A generation sees AT MOST ONE FILL (§17.6), which is what makes
   that agreement mean anything.

   The witness is CONDITIONAL ON [fc_wbool Cf], exactly as
   [FileInvDefs.inode_pay] states it: an O_RDONLY directory fd is legal and
   fileread never needs the fact.  filewrite discharges the condition from
   its own [f->writable] test at +0x00 -- past that branch the bool is true,
   and it is true in the caller's [fcontent] because the content fraction is
   what the [lbu] read.

   The re-park then closes for free: [SpecWritei.wi_dinode] is
   [MkDinode (di_type dn) ...], so the flushed record's type is
   DEFINITIONALLY the fill's and every chunk re-parks with the shot it was
   handed (§17.6 constraint 8).

   (b) THE ALLOCATOR AND THE LOG.  writei calls bmap, which calls balloc, so
   the arm carries the bitmap, [sb.size], [sb.bmapstart] and balloc's printk
   credentials; and it is bracketed by begin_op/end_op, so it carries
   [log_ctx], the crash seam and the generation certificate.  The bitmap
   is a persistent invariant ([BitmapInv.bitmap_inv]), so nothing about
   it comes back.

   ==== THE NUMERIC PREMISES, AND THE ONE FILEREAD HAD THAT THIS DOES NOT ==

   writei's joint bound is [off + n1 < 2^31].  Here it is DISCHARGEABLE
   RATHER THAN INHERITED, and that is the chunking's doing: [n1 <= 3072] by
   construction and [off <= MAXFILE*BSIZE] by [FileInvDefs.off_wf], so the sum is
   at most 277504 -- a closed fact.  So this contract does NOT carry
   fileread's [MAXFILE*BSIZE + n < 2^31] premise, and sys_write will be able
   to take [n] from unchecked user input where sys_read cannot.  (See
   claude-notes/design/file-table.md; this is the one place the write side is
   BETTER off than the read side.)

   [f->off] stays inside [off_wf] for the same reason from the other end:
   writei answers -1 rather than writing when [MAXFILE*BSIZE < off + n1], so
   a chunk that returns a count has [off + tot <= MAXFILE*BSIZE].

   ==== WHAT THE POSTCONDITION SAYS =====================================

   [filewrite_ret n r]: minus one, or a count between 0 and n --
   [PipeInv.pipe_rw_ret] verbatim, as fileread.  The inode arm is strictly
   inside it and in fact answers [n] or [-1] and nothing between (decode fact
   3), but stating the sharper fact would buy a caller nothing: sys_write
   returns the value unexamined, and the pipe and device arms are not sharp.

   The WRITTEN BYTES are not describable here, and that is inherited rather
   than lost: writei's range clause is about [data'], which lives inside the
   escrow's parked payload and no caller-held resource names.  The file's
   OFFSET likewise stays in its inode's off LEDGER (off-ledger ruling). *)

(* filewrite's own frame is 12 slots ([c.addi16sp sp,sp,-96]: ra, s0, s1,

   -- not consolewrite at 72, which is what it was before [K_writei] grew
   (SpecReadi.v's header traces the chain: printk's real stack need, 48, now
   dominates bmap, which dominates balloc's out-of-blocks arm, which
   dominates bmap's callers).  consolewrite's own sixteen-slot frame (a
   32-byte bounce buffer lives in it) sits under either_copyin's 56, and
   neither of its calls is made with interrupts off, so nothing of

     below: the chunk chain's two posts on an inode, the caller's own
     cursor on the console, the landed blanket and nothing more anywhere
     else.

     was settled inside the view shifts the caller supplied at the store,

     hands back the cursor.  Every chunk was FULL (a short one ends the loop
     at -1), so the chain resumes exactly at [length bss].

     THERE IS NO PER-CHUNK RECEIPT BUNDLE, and none is needed: whatever the
     caller wants to record per chunk it records in the PREFIX CURSOR [Q],
     inside the phase 2 that builds the next node, and

     the reason a copy gave up ([FsAbsWriteFire.awrite_part_at]).  Nothing

  (* =================================================================== *)

  (* WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IN, by [st] -- the same key the CODE branches on
     ([f->type] after the [f->writable] test).

     - an open, writable INODE: the commit CHAIN at the cursor [Q], one node
       per possible chunk ([wchunks n] of them);
     - an open, writable CONSOLE DEVICE: the trace seed, and nothing else.
       THE DEVSW PIN IS NOT HERE: [filewrite_dev_env] carries the honest
       disjunction "the slot is null or it is consolewrite"
       ([ConsoleInv.devsw_write_val_cases]) and a null slot is a -1 return at
       +0x12a that no console arm allows, so the pin is REQUIRED -- but it
       is a PURE fact about the names record and it rides this contract's
       Coq premise list ([Hconw] below), not its caller-supplied input.
       That is the piece-shape rule's corollary at the console arm: an
       arbitrary user process supplying this bundle under the ARM knows
       nothing of the kernel's [fwrite_names], so the input may not mention
       one.  A caller discharges the premise from the table it already owns
       ([fwn_wp fn = devsw_write_val] plus
       [ConsoleInv.devsw_write_val_console]).
     - everything else -- a pipe, another device major, an unwritable or
       closed descriptor -- costs nothing and gets the landed blanket back.
       A PIPE AU IS OUT OF SCOPE and deliberately not invented here. *)
  (* ...AND THE DEVICE ARM IS NOW THE INODE ARM'S TWIN (lane OUT-FUPD, F3):
     both arms are a CHAIN over the caller's own cursor family [Q], one node
     per unit of progress -- a chunk on the inode arm, a BYTE on the device
     arm (port [Uart0]'s transmit lock is per byte).  The trace seed [tr0]
     is GONE with the located receipts, and with it the record field
     [UexecExecInst]'s trace-seed field: [wf_Q] serves both arms.

     AND IT IS ASKED FOR AT EVERY MAJOR, not only the console's.  The
     [decide] the seed carried was affordable because the seed was FREE;
     the chain is not.  What the walk actually does is read
     [devsw[major].write] and CALL it, and [filewrite_dev_env] pins that
     cell only to "null or consolewrite" -- at EVERY major, because nothing
     in the kernel's own invariant says a non-console slot is null.  So a
     writable device descriptor at ANY major can reach the console UART,
     and the honest premise is the chain at any major.  (The OUTPUT side of
     the match keeps its [decide]: what is REPORTED is the console's arm
     alone, because only there does the caller know the callee was
     consolewrite.) *)

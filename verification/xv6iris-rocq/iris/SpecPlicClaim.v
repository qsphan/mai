(* SpecPlicClaim.v -- the public interface of plic_claim.
   [plic_claim] (xv6-riscv/kernel/plic.c) asks the PLIC which interrupt this
   hart should serve, and returns its source id (0 = nothing to serve):

     0x800054cc <plic_claim>:
       ...prologue...
       jal    cpuid            a0 = hart id
       slliw  a0,a0,0xd
       lui    a5,0xc201
       add    a5,a5,a0         a5 = PLIC + 0x201000 + hart*0x2000
       lw     a0,4(a5)         a0 = *PLIC_SCLAIM(hart)
       ...epilogue...

   Like plicinithart this runs on every hart concurrently, so it takes the
   device invariant [dev_inv] (WpUart.v) rather than owning [plic_frag] -- see
   SpecPlicinithart.v for why.  The claim READ is a state-changing MMIO
   transaction (the model clears the source's pending bit and marks it claimed),
   so it too is done with the invariant open; the mutation touches no enable
   word, so the kernel's plan [plic_ok] (PlicPlan.v) survives it.

   THE RETURN VALUE IS THE POINT.  A claim hands back the id of the source it
   took, and the plan says a hart's context can only ever have the machine's own
   three sources enabled -- so the id is 0, [uart_irq_id Uart0],
   [uart_irq_id Uart1] or [virtio_irq_id], and nothing else
   ([plic_claim_ret_ok]).  That is exactly what makes devintr()'s branch on
   the result exhaustive, and it is the one fact the loose shared invariant is
   strong enough to deliver.

   The returned word is the 32-bit register value sign-extended into a0 by
   [lw]; all four admissible ids are small and positive, so the post states
   them as the concrete 64-bit words 0, 10, 12 and 1.

   BOTH UARTS' CLAIMS HAND OUT A PAYLOAD, and it is the SAME payload
   ([WpUart.plic_payload_uart], the pop token plus the consumer's high-water
   half): uartintr drains the receive FIFO at BOTH ports -- only the `u->rx`
   hook call is skipped at the port with no consumer -- so a claim returning
   12 must deliver the second port's writer or [SpecUartintr]'s port-generic
   premise is unsuppliable there.  Hence the second ghost bundle [γd1] and
   the second post arm.  Only the disk's source (1) delivers nothing.

   THE PLIC INVARIANT IS TAKEN BARE, beside the bundle.  [WpUart.dev_inv] is
   the CONSOLE bundle and ∃-packs the second port's names, so a contract that
   must NAME them -- this one does, in its post -- takes [plic_inv γd γd1]
   itself.

   Requires only the definitional layer + SpecCpuid -- never a whole-function
   proof file. *)

Definition plic_claim_a0_ok (v : mword 64) : Prop :=
  v = (mword_of_int 0 : mword 64) \/

(* INTERRUPTS MUST BE DISABLED.  plic_claim's very first instruction is an
   unbracketed [jal cpuid] -- there is no push_off/pop_off anywhere in its
   body -- and [cpuid]'s own contract (SpecCpuid.v) is [b = false]-ONLY (it
   reads [tp] mid-body; see the porting guide, "A function that READS tp
   mid-body must be stated at b = false").  A caller-supplied [b] cannot meet
   that precondition, so plic_claim itself can only be called with interrupts
   already off.  This holds transitively at every real call site: plic_claim
   runs from devintr(), reached only from {user,kernel}trap() before
   interrupts are turned back on (usertrap's [intr_on()] sits in the syscall
   arm, never the device-interrupt arm; kerneltrap() PANICS if interrupts are
   found enabled, "kerneltrap: interrupts enabled") -- see
   claude-notes/projects/explicit-cpuid-porting-guide.md. So the contract is
   stated at the literal index [false] rather than a generic [b], with no
   [wp_next] wrapper (it would collapse via [wp_next_off] anyway, since the
   hart cannot move). *)

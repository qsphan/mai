(* SpecBalloc.v -- the public interface of balloc, stated independently of
   any proof.  balloc IS PROVEN: [ProofBalloc.v]'s [BallocProof] functor is
   the single instance of the [Module Type] below, and [LinkBalloc.v]
   carries no [Axiom].  A NEW [Parameter] HERE IS THEREFORE A PROOF
   OBLIGATION ON THAT FUNCTOR, not a free contract widening -- widening this
   interface costs work in a 4100-line proof file.  (It is still not an
   assumption in anyone's [Print Assumptions] cone: a [Module Type]
   parameter discharged by a real proof adds nothing.)

     static uint balloc(uint dev) {
       int b, bi, m;
       struct buf *bp = 0;
       for(b = 0; b < sb.size; b += BPB){
         bp = bread(dev, BBLOCK(b, sb));
         for(bi = 0; bi < BPB && b + bi < sb.size; bi++){
           m = 1 << (bi % 8);
           if((bp->data[bi/8] & m) == 0){    // is the block free?
             bp->data[bi/8] |= m;            // mark it in use
             log_write(bp);
             brelse(bp);
             bzero(dev, b + bi);
             return b + bi;
           }
         }
         brelse(bp);
       }
       printf("balloc: out of blocks\n");
       return 0;
     }

   THE CONTRACT (claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md, "balloc's contract").
   Two arms, on the returned a0:

   - SUCCESS -- a nonzero block b, with the two facts every FS-layer
     consumer of a block number needs ([b] is covered, and it is NOT one of
     the log's own storage blocks), plus b's own [fs_chalf] half at ALL
     ZEROES: bzero has already log_written the block as a zero block, so
     the caller receives a zeroed block and not an arbitrary one.  Spends
     TWO budget units -- the bitmap's log_write plus bzero's.

   - FAILURE -- returns 0, spends nothing, gives nothing: the reservation
     comes back at its full [2 + u].  The arm-dependent budget costs
     nothing to state because the postcondition is already a two-arm
     disjunction on the return value.

   *** THE OUT-OF-BLOCKS ARM IS LIVE, AND IT CALLS printk. ***  Nothing in
   [BitmapInv.bitmap_res] prevents every bit below [sb.size] being set --
   the free pool is then all-[emp] -- so the
   scan CAN fall out of the loop and reach
   [auipc a0,0x4 / addi a0,a0,1350 / jal printk] on "balloc: out of blocks".
   That is the GENERAL printk path ([SpecPrintk.v]), not the panic path,
   so this contract takes:

     - [γpr] and the two PERSISTENT credentials [kernel_data] and
       [printk_env γpr γu γd] (the format string itself needs no premise:
       [KernelDataInv.kernel_data_string_all] mints its persistent string out of
       [kernel_data]);

   THE BITMAP IS AN INVARIANT, NOT A PREMISE.  balloc reads BOTH superblock
   fields out of memory ([sb.size] at sb+4, [sb.bmapstart] at sb+28), so
   the two cells are premises, as plain FRACTIONAL cells the way
   SpecInitlog.v takes [sb + 20].  The bitmap block and its FREE POOL live
   in [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], a persistent Iris invariant at an
   EXISTENTIAL set: the contract says nothing about which bits are set,
   and the postcondition's byte run comes out of the pool at log_write's
   own ghost step ([BitmapInv.bitmap_alloc_au], the supplier for
   [SpecLogWrite.wp_log_write_au]).  This is [InodeRegion]'s shape,
   one layer over; claude-notes/design/fs-bitmap.md has the argument.

   ONE BITMAP BLOCK, AND A THIRD DEAD ARM.  [FSSIZE = 2000 < BPB = 8192],
   so [0 < size <= BPB] is a premise, BBLOCK collapses
   ([BitmapInv.BBLOCK_single]) and the outer loop runs a single iteration:
   b starts at 0, the inner scan exits on [b + bi >= sb.size] or on
   [bi == BPB], and [b += BPB] then makes [b >= sb.size] unconditionally.
   The [0 < size] half of that premise also kills balloc's OWN
   [beqz a5,+0xf6] at +0x12 -- the [sb.size == 0] jump straight to the
   printk, skipping the s2..s8 restore -- which is dead in the same sense
   as log_write's two panics, bmap's "out of range" and bfree's "freeing
   free block": the premise makes the arm unreachable, so it is refuted
   rather than proved.

   balloc SLEEPS (it breads), so it threads the running-process bundle
   exactly as SpecBread.v does: procs_inv / p_pid, the disk fabric
   (dev_inv / disk_geom / the virtio_disk lock), and the trap-CSR complement
   ([trap_csrs_ext eb] / [cpu_claim_ext eb pj], index-free -- see
   claude-notes/completed/eb-generic-sweep.md) that bread's own contract now
   demands.  It enters and returns at noff 0 but PARKS internally, so its
   own crossing is the literal [true], not [b].  The parked scheduler record
   is not threaded -- it lives in the running proc's own [p->lock]. *)

(*  SET carried through it, [SpecBfree.wp_bfree_gen]'s shape verbatim.    *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* WHY.  balloc log_writes exactly TWO blocks, and a caller that is
   allocating several blocks in one transaction pays far less than
   [2 * blocks] for them:

   - THE BITMAP BLOCK.  [BBLOCK] collapses to [bmapstart] for every
     allocatable block ([WriteiBudget.one_bitmap_block], from this
     contract's own [0 < size <= BPB] premise), so EVERY balloc of the
     transaction log_writes THE SAME block.  Only the first pays; the rest
     absorb.  That is what [cr] claims, exactly as in bfree.

   - THE FRESH BLOCK, log_written by the inlined bzero at +0x4c.  It is
     never credited (a freshly allocated block cannot already be in this
     op's set in any way the caller can know), so it always costs one --
     but the caller LEARNS the block is now in the set, and can therefore
     absorb its OWN later log_write of the very same block.  That is the
     data-block absorption without which a four-block chunk of writei does
     not fit MAXOPBLOCKS ([WriteiBudget.wi_cost_noabs_busts]).

   The FAILURE arm log_writes nothing, so both the budget and the set come
   back untouched.  [wp_balloc_sconf] is this at [cr = false] with the set
   forgotten, and is unchanged: every existing caller keeps threading
   [log_op]. *)

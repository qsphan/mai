(* WriteiBudget.v -- THE LOG BUDGET writei ACTUALLY COSTS, and the ledger
   algebra that lets a loop carry it.

   ==== WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ============================================

   [SpecWritei.wi_cost off n = 6 * wi_blocks off n + 1] is a WORST-CASE
   over-approximation: it charges bmap's five (two ballocs at two units
   each, plus bmap's own log_write) for every straddled block, plus
   iupdate's one.  For dirlink -- sixteen bytes at a sixteen-aligned
   offset, so one block -- that is 7 and fits.  For the chunk filewrite's
   own code hands writei ([n1 = min(n - i, max)] with
   [max = ((MAXOPBLOCKS-1-1-2)/2)*BSIZE = 3072]) it is 13..25 against a
   [begin_op] grant of [MAXOPBLOCKS = 10], and NO chunk spanning more than
   one block is payable.  That is filewrite's last blocker.

   The over-approximation is not the code's fault.  The three facts it
   ignores are all already in the tree:

   1. THERE IS EXACTLY ONE BITMAP BLOCK.  [BitmapInv.bitmap_geom_ok] --
      a premise of balloc, bmap, writei and dirlink alike -- contains
      [0 < size <= BPB] with [BPB = 8192], so [BitmapInv.BBLOCK] collapses
      to [bmapstart] for EVERY allocatable block ([one_bitmap_block]
      below).  All five ballocs of a four-block chunk log_write the SAME
      block.  This is the fact the S3i sizing missed, and it is why the
      honest cost is [B + 3] and not [2B + 3].
   2. THE INDIRECT BLOCK IS ALLOCATED AT MOST ONCE PER FILE, and bmap's own
      [log_write(bp)] on the indirect path writes the very block balloc's
      [bzero] just wrote.
   3. balloc's [bzero] LOG_WRITES THE FRESH DATA BLOCK, and writei then
      log_writes THE SAME BLOCK.  The log absorbs the second.

   All three are ABSORPTIONS, and [LogInv] already models absorption: an
   op's ledger entry carries the set of blocks it has appended in this
   batch ([LogInv.log_opS]), [SpecLogWrite]'s credited arm hands the unit
   straight back when the block is in that set, and [LogInv.op_sum_absorb]
   is what keeps the header's sum tie inductive across it.  Nothing new is
   needed at the invariant level -- only a way for a LOOP to carry "these
   particular blocks are paid for" without case-splitting on how many
   iterations have run.  [SpecItrunc.bm_paid] is that shape for ONE block;
   [log_amort] below is it for a SET, which is what writei needs (the
   bitmap block AND the indirect block).

   ==== THE ALGEBRA =====================================================

   [log_amort γ F u] reads

       "u units are genuinely free, AND one unit is still held back for
        each block of F this op has not yet logged."

   as the potential function [u + size (F ∖ Sb) <= v] over the op's real
   remaining budget [v] and its real already-logged set [Sb].  It is
   IDEMPOTENT under a log_write of a block of F ([log_amort_present]):
   from the unpaid state the unit is spent and the block joins Sb, so the
   potential is unchanged; from the paid state log_write's credited arm
   absorbs and the unit comes back.  Either way [u] does not move, so a
   loop invariant mentions [log_amort γ F u] and never splits on which
   iteration happened to be the first to touch the bitmap.

   [log_amort_spend] is the other half: a log_write of a block OUTSIDE F
   costs one unit of [u], which is exactly the per-data-block charge.

   [log_amort_adopt] is what lets F GROW at the moment balloc returns the
   indirect block: enlarging F by a block that is already in Sb leaves the
   potential untouched, so writei can enter its loop reserving capacity for
   an indirect block whose identity it does not yet know.

   ==== THE RESULTING BUDGET ============================================

   [wi_cost_tight off n = wi_blocks off n + 3]: one unit per straddled data
   block, plus one each for the bitmap block, the indirect block and the
   inode block iupdate flushes.  [wi_cost_tight_fits] is the theorem that
   matters -- for any chunk of at most 3072 bytes, at ANY offset, it is at
   most MAXOPBLOCKS.  The worst case the code can produce is 7 of the 10
   begin_op pays, and dirlink's site drops from 7 to 4.

   [wi_logset_size] is the honest statement of WHY: the whole transaction's
   write set is the B data blocks plus three, whatever the interleaving.

   The two accountings recorded at the bottom ([wi_cost_armaware],
   [wi_cost_noabs]) are the intermediate repairs sized in the S3i ledger,
   both of which STILL bust 10 -- kept as machine-checked evidence that all
   three absorptions are load-bearing and none may be dropped.

   NOTHING HERE IS A STATEMENT CHANGE.  This file is additive: no existing
   contract mentions it, and [SpecWritei.wi_cost] is untouched.  It is the
   seam the writei/bmap/balloc retrofit plugs into. *)

(*  8. THE PER-ITERATION COST, AS A FUNCTION OF THE ARMS bmap CAN TAKE    *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* What ONE iteration of writei's loop costs the ledger, split by the four
   facts a caller can observe at the call site.  Read [ai] as "bmap
   allocated the indirect block", [ad] as "bmap allocated the data block",
   [ind] as "this file index goes through the indirect block", and the two
   credit bits as "the bitmap / the indirect block is already in this op's
   logged set".

     - the FIRST balloc of the call pays for the bitmap block unless it is
       credited; every later one absorbs, because there is exactly one
       bitmap block ([one_bitmap_block]);
     - each allocation pays ONE for its own bzero;
     - bmap's own [log_write(bp)] of the indirect block runs only when it
       installed a data block on the indirect path, and absorbs when the
       indirect block is credited -- which it always is when bmap itself
       just bzero'd it;
     - the caller's OWN log_write of the data block absorbs exactly when
       bmap allocated it (balloc's bzero put it in the set), and otherwise
       costs one.

   [bm_iter_cost_one] is the theorem: NET OF THE TWO CREDITS, every arm
   costs exactly ONE.  That one unit is the [B] of [wi_cost_tight]; the two
   credited bits are the [+2] writei's [log_amort] holds back, and the
   [ai] unit is paid out of the same reservation the first time. *)

(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  9. WHICH CREDITS ARE ACTUALLY LOAD-BEARING                            *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* Section 5 showed both of S3i's weaker accountings bust.  This is the
   other end of the question: [wi_cost_tight]'s 7 buys three slots of
   slack, but the retrofit does NOT have to buy all of it.  The absorptions
   split into three, and only TWO of them are load-bearing:

   (a) THE BITMAP CREDIT, across the whole call.  Every balloc of the
       transaction log_writes the same block ([one_bitmap_block]), so the
       first pays and the rest absorb.  REQUIRED: without it a four-block
       chunk pays five bitmap writes instead of one and lands at 14.

   (b) THE DATA-BLOCK ABSORPTION.  balloc's bzero of a fresh block and
       writei's own log_write of it are the same block, so exactly ONE of
       the two is ever paid -- and a block that is NOT fresh skips the bzero
       and pays the log_write instead, which is why the charge is one per
       straddled block either way.  REQUIRED: without it, 14 again.

   (c) THE CROSS-ITERATION INDIRECT CREDIT.  bmap's own [log_write(bp)] of
       the indirect block runs on EVERY iteration that installs a data block
       on the indirect path.  When bmap allocated the indirect block in the
       same call it absorbs against balloc's bzero of it -- that is the case
       [WriteiBudget]'s header calls absorption (2) -- but when the indirect
       block was allocated by an EARLIER ITERATION of the same writei call,
       the absorption is against that earlier iteration's write and needs a
       credit that survives across iterations.

   (c) IS NOT REQUIRED.  With (a) and (b) alone the honest cost is
   [2 * B + 2]: one for the bitmap, one for iupdate, and TWO per straddled
   block (its own write, plus one indirect write that did not absorb).  At
   B = 4 that is EXACTLY MAXOPBLOCKS -- it fits, with ZERO slack.  So a
   cheaper bmap contract carrying ONE credit instead of two is sound, and
   the second credit's whole value is the three slots of headroom between
   [wi_cost_bmonly = 10] and [wi_cost_tight = 7].

   Recording this because "which absorptions must I model?" is exactly the
   question the S3i sizing got wrong in the other direction, and the answer
   is not "all of them". *)

(* [wi_cost_bmonly] itself now lives in [SpecWritei], beside [wi_cost] whose
   replacement it is: writei's PUBLIC contract is stated on it, and this
   file REQUIRES SpecWritei, so the definition cannot sit here.  Everything
   below is its arithmetic. *)

   one-credit accounting stops fitting, while the two-credit one still has

(* ===================================================================== *)

(* Section 9 says the accounting fits at [2B + 2]; this section is that
   accounting AS A LOOP INVARIANT, discharged arm by arm against
   [SpecBmap.bmap_cost], so that the [ProofWritei] retrofit is an
   application of five lemmas rather than five re-derivations.

   THE POTENTIAL.  The bitmap block is paid for AT MOST ONCE in the whole
   call, but WHICH iteration pays is not known in advance -- it is the
   first one that allocates, and a call may never allocate at all.  A case
   split on "has the bitmap been paid yet" would infect every clause of a
   loop invariant that already has fourteen; instead the unpaid bitmap is
   carried as ONE unit of held-back capacity, [bm_pot], which is 1 while
   [bmapstart] is outside the op's logged set and 0 forever after.  Both
   step lemmas below are then uniform in the arm.

   This is [log_amort]'s potential (section 7) at [F = {[bmapstart]}],
   written out on the raw set instead of behind the sealed predicate,
   because the set-form contract of section 18 has to EXPOSE [Sb] and

(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  THE ITERATION, AS THE LOOP ACTUALLY TAKES IT: bmap THEN log_write      *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* The two step lemmas above bound the WHOLE iteration -- bmap's arm-wise
   spend plus writei's own [log_write] of the chunk.  Getting from one to
   the other needs the fact that the log_write ABSORBS on exactly the arm
   where it must, and that fact is not arithmetic: it is a property of the
   block map.

   THE PROBLEM ARM is [al = true, ind = true, crlw = false] -- bmap paid
   for the bitmap AND an indirect write, and then writei paid again for its
   own chunk: three units plus one, against the [2 + bm_pot] the accounting
   allows.  It cannot arise.  On the indirect path, an allocating call
   allocated the DATA block, so balloc's [bzero] already logged it and
   writei's [log_write] is free.

   WHY: [bmap_alloced] is [ai || ad].  If [ad] we are done.  If [ai] then
   the indirect BLOCK was 0 on the way in, and [blkmap_wf]'s "no indirect
   block => no entries" conjunct ([InodeInv.blkmap_wf_ind_nz], read
   backwards) makes every indirect ENTRY 0 too -- so the data block was 0
   on the way in, is nonzero on the way out (the success arm), and [ad]
   holds after all. *)

(* THE ALLOCATING ITERATION's spend, bmap and log_write together.  [nB] is

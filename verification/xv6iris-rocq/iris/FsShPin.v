(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS.  [FsInitPin.v] proved, about era 0's durable map
    [era0_D] and about EVERY abstract state that map denotes, that

      the PATH PIN     ["init"] resolves, in the root directory, to inum 7
      the CONTENT PIN  inum 7's row is [MkAnode (AFile init_bytes) 1]
      the WALK         [arun av ROOTINO ["init"] [ROOTINO; 7]] -- exactly
                       the premise [FsAbsPins.apr_walk] takes

    and [FsInitPinBoot.v] identified the map a BOOT founds its file system
    at with [era0_D], off either of the two routes the boot uses.  THIS
    FILE IS THE SAME THREE SENTENCES FOR THE SHELL, at inum 13 with
    [ElfUser.sh_elf]'s bytes, plus the transport corollaries -- and it is
    written to REUSE both files rather than to restate them.

    WHY IT IS WANTED.  /init's whole job is [exec("/sh")], and a verified
    /init answers kexec's contract for the shell out of its own pins, so
    the lemma names below are that bundle's inputs -- deliberately
    [FsInitPin]'s shapes with [init] replaced by [sh] throughout.

    WHAT IS REUSED, AND WHY NOTHING IS RESTATED.
      - [FsInitPin] section 1's [img_*] lemmas ([img_astep_root],
        [img_apath_root], [img_abs_file], [img_dur_node]) were stated at an
        ARBITRARY [(P, sb)] precisely so that only the LITERAL corollaries
        pay for a computation.  The shell is a second literal corollary and
        pays exactly its own two [vm_eq]s (§2), nothing more.
      - [FsInitPin]'s [era0_D], [era0_arow], [era0_dur_root],
        [era0_root_row], [node_at_nondir] and [nfile_inj] are cited.
      - [FsInitPinBoot]'s [era0_boot_snap_ok] / [era0_recovery_D] /
        [era0_lend_D] / [era0_dblk_full] carry §4's transport with no new
        reasoning about the boot at all: they say "the era-0 map is
        [era0_D]", which is a fact about the map and not about which file
        pins what inside it.
      - R10: no landed statement moves.  This file is a THIRD LEAF over the
        same cone ([FsInitPinBoot]'s, which is [FsInitPin]'s), required by
        nothing.

    THE TWO MEASURED TRAPS, both inherited and both respected here.
      (1) [FsInitPin] §3's PERFORMANCE RULE.  [Some (NFile _)] must be
          injected AT VARIABLES: an [injection]/[exact] against an equation
          one of whose sides is the file's literal does not finish, because
          conversion is free to unfold [FsTree.file_bytes], which is
          QUADRATIC in the file size.  The shell is the biggest of the four
          user programs -- 58,312 bytes against /init's 35,976 -- so the
          margin here is worse, not better.  [nfile_inj] is CITED from
          [FsInitPin] (it is already proved at variables) and §2's instance
          closes by transitivity through [node_at], where both sides are
          the same term syntactically and the kernel compares nothing.
          Likewise [Some_inj], never [injection], in §5.
      (2) [FsInitPinBoot]'s LEAF-RULE trap, recorded in that file's
          worklist entry: in an [FsImgCheck]-consumer leaf, [set_solver] is
          UPSTREAM's (the [FastSetSolver] override is a [Tactic Notation]
          and needs IMPORT, which the intermediate [Require Import]s
          break), and one [set_solver] closing [b ∉ ∅] beside the
          1,999-element [fsimg_cov] literal cost that file 3.2 s -> 3 m
          49 s.  THIS FILE CONTAINS NO [set_solver]: the one place that
          would want one is inside [era0_boot_map] / [era0_dblk_full],
          which are CITED, not re-proved.

    WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here says the shell is still at inum 13
    after any write: every sentence is about [era0_D], the map era 0's
    durable extent IS, or is hedged behind the era-0 disk equation
    [fs_blocks dk = fsimg_P] that [SystemAdequacy]'s power-on takes.      *)

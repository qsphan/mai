   ==== IT DIVERGES, SO THE CONTRACT IS A CONSUMPTION LIST ==============

   Like scheduler()'s, this spec has no continuation: the postcondition of a
   function that never returns is [mWP Loop], full stop
   (claude-notes/completed/scheduler.md).  What that makes the precondition
   is a list of everything kexit CONSUMES, and the interesting entries are
   the process's own:

   * [proc_priv] goes in and does not come back.  It is the ONE resource
     kexit exists to retire: every descriptor's [file_ref] goes to
     fileclose, the cwd reference goes to iput, and what is left --
     the scalar cells, the emptied array with the fd units fileclose handed
     back, the user page table and the trapframe page -- is exactly
     [ProcInv.proc_dormant _ ZOMBIE] minus its context cells, which is what
     the park deposits in [p->lock] for kwait()/freeproc to reclaim.  The
     [FDSPARE] allowance travels beside it (FdSlots.v) and is retired the
     same way.

   * [own_ctx] and the hart tag go in and do not come back either, for the
     same reason they come BACK from yield and sleep: the difference between
     a park you return from and a park you do not is entirely in whether the
     resume ever happens, and kexit's does not.  Its saved context is
     nonetheless real memory, and the parked slot owns it -- see
     [SchedCtx.proc_slots_park_gen], which forgets the RECORD and keeps the
     cells.

   * The whole file-system stack rides through because of the three
     instructions [begin_op(); iput(p->cwd); end_op();]: [bio_ctx],
     [log_ctx], the crash seam, the disk fabric and three buffer slots are
     end_op's and iput's premises verbatim.  Nothing about the log survives
     the call sequence -- the reservation is opened and closed inside kexit
     -- so none of it appears in a postcondition that does not exist.

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   THE TRAP-CSR COMPLEMENT [trap_csrs_ext eb] / [cpu_claim_ext eb pj], and
   NOT [eb = true ->].  At level 0 with an enabled base the pushing acquire
   hands out the trap CSRs the chain payload demands: kexit's own
   acquire(&wait_lock) produces that pay and the release(&wait_lock) before
   sched() spends the SECOND acquire's, so at [eb = true] kexit is balanced,
   the complement is [emp], and it asks the caller for no [arm_pay] -- the
   sys_pause rule.  With the base DISABLED the acquire mints nothing, and
   the pair has to come from the caller, which is the trap.  That is what
   lets usertrap call kexit(-1) on the paths that have not run intr_on() --
   the whole point of the eb-generic sweep.  Nothing is handed back, because
   kexit does not return.

   [is_lock γw wait_lock_addr ... wait_res_at] -- kexit is the second consumer
   of the parent table after kwait, and takes it exactly as kwait does.

   The [initproc] cell at any fraction: kexit reads it for the panic test and
   reparent reads it again for the new parent.  It is write-once (userinit is
   the only writer, and is one of the tree's assumed contracts), so a
   fraction is all any reader needs and nothing here has to say who holds the
   rest.  Same premise, same spelling, as SpecReparent.v's.

   NOTE the panic arm is NOT ruled out.  kexit's caller does not have to
   prove [p <> initproc]: [panic] never returns, so the no-postcondition
   convention closes that arm at zero cost (SpecPanic.v), and the honest
   reading of the contract is "exits the calling process, or panics".  The
   same convention closes the [panic("zombie exit")] that follows sched --
   which is the arm a resumed zombie would take, and the reason its saved
   context can be forgotten rather than proved unreachable. *)

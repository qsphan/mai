(* HartStepFull.v -- THE CYCLE RULE WITH ALL SIX ARMS, AND THE WAITING HART.

   [HartStepAny.swp_try_step_any] offers two of [try_step]'s arms
   ([Step_Execute (Retire_Success tt, _)] and [Step_Pending_Interrupt]) and
   refuses the rest with [| _ => False].  The user tier needs four more --
   the two execute-produced faults ([Illegal_Instruction], [Trap]), the
   failed fetch ([Step_Fetch_Failure]) and the wait entry
   ([Step_Execute (Enter_Wait wr, ib)]) -- plus the step a hart that is
   ALREADY waiting takes.  This file is those two rules.

   THREE THINGS THE MODEL SAYS THAT THE ARMS HAVE TO MIRROR (read off
   [rv64d.try_step], and cross-checked against the proved [exec] facts
   [UserTrap.exec_riscv_step_fetch_failure] / [_execute_illegal] /
   [_execute_trap] and [UserStep.exec_riscv_step_enter_wait] /
   [_wait_stay] / [_wait_wake]):

   - THE FOUR TRAP-ISH ARMS ARE [retired = false].  [Illegal_Instruction],
     [Trap] and [Step_Fetch_Failure] each run their handler, then the
     epilogue's [read_reg hart_state] (still ACTIVE), then [tick_pc], then
     [and_boolM (returnM false) (read_reg minstret_increment)] -- which
     SHORT-CIRCUITS, so [minstret_increment] is not even read and minstret
     is not bumped.  Their tails are therefore literally the
     [Step_Pending_Interrupt] tail, and all four land in
     [∃ mi, wrap_post rs2 mi] by [HartMCycle.reg_set_id_agree_local].

   - THE ENTER-WAIT ARM IS DIFFERENT IN KIND, AND IT IS THE REASON THE
     POST-FILE OF THIS RULE IS NOT [wrap_post].  With [wait_is_nop wr =
     false] the arm WRITES [hart_state := HART_WAITING (wr, instbits)]
     itself (nothing else), the epilogue's [read_reg hart_state] then sees
     a WAITING hart and returns [true] -- so there is NO [tick_pc] and NO
     minstret bump, and the file the cycle lands on is
     [register_set hart_state (HART_WAITING (wr, ib)) rs2].  That is why
     [tsf_post] below MATCHES on the step: the plan's suggestion to relax
     [swp_try_step_any]'s [HQhart] premise is not what is needed --
     [run_hart_active] returns [Enter_Wait] with the hart still ACTIVE, so
     [HQhart] stays TRUE and uniform; it is the CONCLUSION's post-file that
     has to admit a second shape.

   - [Q] IS INDEXED BY THE STEP, not just by the file.  A caller whose
     invariant constrains the wait reason ([UserExec]'s WAITING case is
     [wr = WAIT_WRS_STO \/ wr = WAIT_WRS_NTO]) cannot re-establish it from
     [∃ wr ib, rs3 = register_set hart_state (HART_WAITING (wr, ib)) rs2]:
     the machine picks the arm, so the only place the caller can say
     anything about [wr] is a premise about the step the body reached.
     [Q : Step -> regstate -> Prop] costs nothing (the arms that ignore the
     step instantiate it constantly) and it is also what lets a caller tell
     a retire from a trap without decoding the post-file.

   The rider is INDEXED on the body's post-file ([R rs2] / [Psi rs2]),
   per the [_ex] convention of [HartMCycle.wp_loop_cycle_ex] /
   [HartStepAny.swp_try_step_any_ex]; the plain rider is the instance
   [R := fun _ => R0].  The WAITING rules keep a plain rider: they have no
   body obligation, so their rider is a resource the caller hands in BEFORE
   the step and there is no post-file for it to be keyed on.

   The waiting rule [swp_try_step_waiting] has no body obligation at all:
   [run_hart_waiting] is a register-only stretch over mip / mie /
   hart_state, all owned, so it is ONE [HartMemRun.swp_hmrun_of_exec] at
   [mm := ∅] -- the "goodmb at the empty map IS the register-writing
   analogue of [hval_of_goodb]" move of the port plan.  Its conclusion is a
   DISJUNCTION because the machine chooses: the wake test reads mip, which
   [wp_loop_cycle]'s continuation does not carry across a cycle (mip is in
   [tk_clock3]), and [valid_reservation] is an opaque platform predicate
   ([xv6iris_extras.resv_is_valid]; see ResvAxioms.v's header for why the
   reservation's CONTENT stays assumed while its two effectful hooks do not).

   The three [exec_run_hart_waiting_*] facts and their [goodmb] twins are
   proved HERE rather than imported from [UserStep.v]: they are facts about
   the model, with no user-tier content, and this file sits below the tier.
   [UserStep.v]'s copies become redundant when the tier lands -- and its
   [_stay] is stated too strongly: at [exit_wait = false] the only reachable
   wake patterns are [(WAIT_WRS_STO|WAIT_WRS_NTO, false, _)], so a
   [WAIT_WFI] hart stays waiting whatever [valid_reservation] answers.  The
   version here takes the disjunction, which is what makes the case split in
   [swp_try_step_waiting] EXHAUSTIVE.

   TWO THINGS THAT COST TIME AND WILL COST IT AGAIN:
   - [bytes_own ∅] is [emp], hence PERSISTENT: [iAssert … as "H"] files it
     in the intuitionistic context, where it is never consumed, and the next
     [iDestruct] that wants the name fails with "not fresh".  Introduce it as
     [#Hemp] and never re-use the name.
   - the shared tail of the four non-retiring arms is written out four times
     on purpose.  An [Ltac] abbreviation does NOT work here: a tactic
     notation's [constr] argument inside an [Ltac] body is elaborated at
     DEFINITION time, so [iApply (… Drw …)] fails with "The reference Drw was
     not found" before the proof is ever run.

   THIS FILE IS ADDITIVE TO [HartStepAny] AND BELONGS IN IT (which in turn
   belongs in [HartMCycle]); it is separate only so that iterating does not
   rebuild a bottom-of-tree cone.  Fold all three back at a milestone. *)

(* SpecBwrite.v -- the public interface of bwrite, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void bwrite(struct buf *b) {
       if (!holdingsleep(&b->lock)) panic("bwrite");
       virtio_disk_rw(b, 1);
     }

   The write-through: the caller's held buffer goes to the disk.  The
   block's [disk_block] rides INSIDE the handle (claude-notes/design/
   fs-log.md), so the exchange is interior: the handle comes back with its
   disk value equal to its bytes.  The handle is the PAYLOAD-LESS
   [bio_hold0]: a content-changing write (write_head rewriting the
   header) necessarily has logical /= disk on one side of the call
   whatever the order of the ghost update and the write, so the clean
   payload's disk tie cannot appear here -- the caller holds its
   [bio_pay] aside across the call ([BioInv.bio_held_split]) and
   re-pairs afterwards (write_head: gamma_L update AFTER the write, then
   the clean tie holds; install_trans: the dirty payload never mentions
   the disk value at all).
   The panic arm is dead: [bio_locked] carries the sleeplock token and the
   holder-carried pid cell, and the caller's own pid cell agrees, so
   holdingsleep returns 1 (SpecHoldingsleep.v's holder variant).

   Because the body calls virtio_disk_rw, this spec threads rw's whole
   resource list (SpecVirtioDiskRw.v): the running-process identity and
   sleep plumbing, the disk fabric, and the vdisk lock. *)

     is a WRITE-THROUGH, so it is one of the WAL's write kinds and its
     caller owes the durability view shift.  Threaded verbatim to
     virtio_disk_rw (SpecVirtioDiskRw.v), which deposits it in the permit
     channel at the publish; the DMA COMPLETION -- the instant these bytes
     reach the durable image -- runs it, and [Q] is the caller's RECEIPT.
     Placed adjacent to the handle, exactly where rw places its own (after
     the buffer/[disk_block] pair it is about).

     THE PERMIT IS INDEXED BY THIS CALL'S OWN WRITE (phase C2a): bwrite
     always writes, and it writes [bs] at block [bno] -- bytes
     [1024 * bno ..].  A WRITE's permit is NOT free the way a READ's is, and
     that is the honest content of the indexed crash predicate: every one of
     the three log.c call sites supplies a REAL durability fupd
     ([FsCrash.fs_logfill_v_seq_permit] and its siblings), and there is no
     [Pc]-generic way to write a disk block.

     A 512-BYTE SECTOR IS ATOMIC AND A 1024-BYTE BLOCK IS NOT
     (claude-notes/completed/sector-atomic-disk.md §6e), so the durability
     obligation unfolds ONE SECTOR AT A TIME: [disk_seq_permit] is a
     conjunction over the sectors still to land, each branch a view shift at
     that sector's own slice [wr_sector w i] whose receipt is the RESIDUAL
     obligation for the rest, and whose leaf -- the completion, which moves
     no disk byte -- delivers [Q].  The device picks the landing order, so
     the caller proves every branch from the SAME resources; whatever a later
     sector needs (the WAL's mirror half, what an earlier sector learned)
     travels down the chain rather than having to be curried into two
     independent permits, which is impossible for an exclusive resource. *)

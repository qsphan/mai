(* MbootVocab.v -- the M-mode boot contract's VOCABULARY: the handful of pure
   definitions [SpecEntry.wp_entry_boot] is written in, and nothing else.

   The boot contract used to be stated over the M-mode proofs' own symbolic
   execution -- [WpStartNew.st_mout] and friends, a 27-deep tower of one
   [Definition] per register write, on top of [WpTimerinit.ti_mout]'s 15 and
   [WpEntryNew.m_jal]'s 8.  Naming that tower in the interface put fifty
   proof-internal definitions (and, through the decode constants they are
   indexed by, three [Code*.v] files) in the require closure of every Spec
   file that could reach SpecEntry.  It also said far more than any client
   consumes: [BootBridge] reads exactly two registers out of the final file
   and then existentially quantifies it.

   So the contract now quantifies its post-state and hands back FACTS, and
   what is left to name is what a caller genuinely has to compute for itself:

     - [mb_entry_sp]  the stack pointer _entry computes, stack0 + 4096*(hart+1)
     - [mb_frame]     a 16-byte frame drop (start()'s, then timerinit's)
     - [mb_ti_ra] / [mb_ti_s0]  timerinit's two frame slots, whose addresses
                      the caller must place inside the PMP region
     - [mb_ld_ea]     the image word _entry loads the stack0 pointer out of
     - [mb_tpv]       the value start() writes to tp (sext32 of mhartid)
     - [mb_pmp_open]  the PMP-entry-0 shape start() leaves behind, exactly
                      the six premises of [SmodePte.pmp_config_intro]

   Every one is stated over the definitional layer alone -- the decode-field
   constants come from [WpDecode.v] / [ExecCommon.v], never from a [Code*.v]
   -- so this file, and hence SpecEntry, sits below every weakest
   precondition.  The bridges from the M-mode proofs' internal forms to these
   ([WpEntryNew.m_jal_sp], [WpTimerinit.ti_*_mb], [WpStartNew.st_mout_*])
   live next to the towers they unfold. *)

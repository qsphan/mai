(* THE ECALL LEAVES' DEPOSIT PREMISE IS A WAND, NOT A BARE HYPOTHESIS.
   Since the ARM every returning leaf owes the trap contract the process's
   bundle for the number it is at ([UexecRet.uexec_dep_F]), and the key that
   bundle is at is [uvis_of_run m pc M pm sz fdv cw gn cs] -- whose [M], [pm],
   [sz], [fdv] and [cw] are bound by [UkRun.urun]'s own existential, so a
   leaf has them only AFTER it destructs and can never name them in its own
   statement.  Hence [UkRun.udepw]: a wand off the two authorities the leaf
   already holds, yielding either [psok n] (mint from the program's supplier)
   or the explicit deposit.  Same wall as the key-free minting law, one
   level out. *)

  (* row's shape.  This is the arm init and sh both take.                  *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
  (* WAIT MOVES THE CALLER'S CHILDREN READING, so the leaf takes the
     program's half of it and hands it back at what the reap left -- the
     fork leaf's shape ([UkFork.wp_uk_ecall_fork]'s [Sc]).  The move itself
     is [UserChildren.uch_update] against the authority [urun] carries: the
     kernel's answer says what the set became ([UexecRet.uwait_ans]) and
     the two halves are moved together here, which is the only place both
     are in one hand.  THE ANSWER IS WHAT THE LEAF REPORTS, unopened: on
     its reaping arm it names the generation that left the set, hands over
     that child's ESCROW ([ChildTok.exit_tok] -- the payload its exit paid)
     and the pid uniqueness that makes the returned number identify it, so
     a program holding [ChildTok.child_tok] for a child it forked redeems
     the payload here ([ChildTok.gen_uniq_tok], then [ChildTok.gen_pay]). *)
  (* ...AND THE ROW A RESUMING CALLER PROVES ABOUT ITS OWN -1 (lane
     TRAP-ROWS-3, T4(c)).  A process that comes BACK here was not killed
     ([SpecUsertrap.ut_live_out]'s header), and at a null status pointer
     the copyout exit cannot fire either -- so the only -1 left is the
     childless one, and the reap-nothing arm does not move the reading.
     The caller therefore reads a -1 as ITS OWN SET IS EMPTY, which is
     what a program holding [ChildTok.child_tok] for a child it forked
     refutes.  This is the whole point of the row; the leaf below is the
     same call with the row dropped, for the callers that do not read it. *)
  (* ...AND THE ONE PLACE THE RUN'S PID IS LEGIBLE (lane TRAP-ROWS-4, B1b).
     The answer's reaping arm names the CALLER'S OWN pid
     ([UexecRet.uwait_ans_pid] at [uvis_pid W]), and the only party that
     can tie that number to anything is this leaf: [urun] carries the pid
     AUTHORITY ([UkRun.urun_ids]) and the program carries the fragment, and
     they meet here and nowhere else.  So the proof is written ONCE, over a
     READER the caller supplies -- a one-shot accessor on the authority,
     spent exactly where the run is open -- and the two leaves below are
     its two instances: [wp_uk_ecall_wait_null_live] at the trivial reader
     (its statement verbatim as it always was) and
     [wp_uk_ecall_wait_null_pid] at the program's own fragment. *)

       finding for why the run cannot instead be handed back OWED).
       pipe(2) is the ONE number that puts a pipe row in the table, so it
       is the one number [UsysMemOk.usys_fd_ok_nopipe] does not cover and
       the run's [UkRun.urun_nopipe] cannot re-establish by itself.  What
       stood here was [□ riscv_kill_cred] -- the credential every pipe
       payment is payable from -- so a verified program could not call
       pipe(2) and stay untainted.  What stands here now is the CALLER'S
       OWN FUPD from ROW 4'S POST, where the new pipe's names and its exact
       byte-queue fragment live, to the two new rows' REGISTRATION
       ([UexecSG.srow_reg], one [□]-guarded close payment per row).

       WHY THE POST GOES IN AND [Rp] COMES OUT.  This file is stated over
       the deposit class and cannot open row 4's post, so the step has to
       be the caller's; and registering a pipe CONSUMES the fragment (a
       registration is a [□] and one fragment buys exactly one payment --
       [PipeReg.pipe_cpay_of_frag]), so the post cannot come back
       unchanged.  The caller therefore says what it keeps, and the leaf
       hands that on: [UkReadPipe.wp_uk_pipe_read_end] is the instance's
       reading, where [Rp] is the fragment's successor.

       THE MASK IS [⊤], which is where the leaf's own step runs; the pure
       premise is the fd row's else-branch, so a call that FAILED (no pipe,
       no new row) is registered for free out of the run's own reading.
       A caller that wants the OLD behaviour takes [Rp := spost_at …] and
       supplies this from the credential ([UkRun.urun_nopipe_taint]). *)

  (* THE FD VIEW.  What the process sees of the kernel's file layer: one
     [FdSlots.fdstate] per descriptor -- CLOSED, or OPEN at a type -- for
     the NOFILE descriptors of [p->ofile[]].  It is user-visible for the
     same reason [uvis_sz] is: open(2) hands back a descriptor of a known
     type and the program's next read(2) behaves by that type, so a
     contract that cannot name it cannot say what the program observes.

     A VALUE, not the ghost name.  [ProcDefs.pv_fdg] is the name of the
     per-incarnation ghost; the STATES it authorizes are what the kernel
     holds as [FdSlots.fd_frags (pv_fdg V) sts] across the trap, and [sts]
     is what goes here.  So the key stays a pure record -- no resource, no
     [gname] -- and the tie to reality is the same one [uvis_M] and
     [uvis_perm] have: the trap boundary INSTANTIATES the key at the value
     it is holding ([uvis_of] takes it), and nothing else may. *)

  (* THE WORKING DIRECTORY, as its inum.  A process observes its cwd --
     every relative path it opens starts there -- and chdir(2) moves it,

     [ProcDefs.pv_cwi], the inum the kernel's [p->cwd] pointer labels: the
     boundary instantiates it off the block ([uvis_of]), the syscall rows
     say which entry may move it ([UsysMemOk.usys_cwd_ok]: chdir, and only
     when it succeeds), fork's arm copies it parent to child, and exec

     wait()-side resource transfer has to be indexed by -- a pid is reused
     and a generation is not.  It is a VALUE for [uvis_fd]'s reason: the
     kernel holds the cell, the key carries the name it reads off it, and
     [uvis_of] takes it as a parameter.  Exec keeps it (the identity
     survives exec) and no syscall moves it
     ([UsysMemOk.usys_gen_ok]). *)

  (* THE GENERATIONS OF THIS PROCESS'S LIVE CHILDREN -- the reading of the
     kernel's per-slot children cell (the [wait_lock] sibling of the parent
     cells, [WaitInv]).  It is user-visible because wait(2) is: the -1 arm
     is "this process has no children" and the success arm names one of
     them, so a contract that cannot NAME the set cannot say what wait
     observes.  fork adds the child's generation, exit reparents a set into
     init's, wait removes the one it reaped; every other entry keeps it
     ([UsysMemOk.usys_ch_ok]). *)
  uvis_ch   : gset gname;
  (* THE PROCESS'S PID.  It is user-visible because getpid(2) returns it --
     [UsysMemOk.usys_ret_pid] is the row that says the answer IS this
     field -- so a contract that cannot name it cannot say what that call
     observes.

     A VALUE, for [uvis_fd]'s reason and [uvis_gen]'s: the kernel holds the
     cell ([p->pid], which [ProcInv.proc_priv] carries at 1/2 and which
     every kernel contract on the trap route names as [pid]), and the key
     carries the number the boundary read off it.  [uvis_of] takes it as a
     PARAMETER for [sts]'s reason -- [ustate] does not carry it, it is
     [proc_priv]'s own index -- and every call site is a place holding the
     block.

     NOBODY MOVES IT.  Exec keeps it (a pid survives exec: it is the same
     process), and no syscall re-numbers its caller, which is why the
     returning arm's [UexecRet.bump] KEEPS it rather than taking it as a
     parameter.  fork's CHILD gets allocproc's, which the depositing parent
     cannot name, so the child's key ∀-binds it exactly as it ∀-binds the
     child's generation ([UexecRet.uexec_fork_child_F], [SpecKfork]'s slot
     premise). *)

     exactly as it shows a mapped RW page ([UserPerm.perm_of]'s fill), and
     copyout can write only the second kind -- so a process that owns a
     byte cannot, from [uvis_perm] alone, refute a copyout fault at it.
     This bit is what closes that gap: at [false] the fill is EMPTY
     ([UserPerm.lazy_free]) and every W page of the projection is a real
     user leaf ([UserPerm.lazy_free_wmapped]).

     A VALUE, for [uvis_fd]'s reason and [uvis_cwd]'s: the KERNEL holds the
     bit ([ProcDefs.pv_lazy], whose meaning is [ProcInv.proc_priv_core]'s
     own invariant) and the key carries what the boundary read off the
     block.  It is STORED rather than computed because vmfault maps a page
     -- so the table's own verdict moves across a trap the process cannot
     see, while the trap loop's transparent arm returns the slot AT THE

Local Lemma tf_upd_ne (f : regfile) (k j : regidx) (v w : mword 64) :

(* THE THREE REGISTERS A WHOLE-PROCESS ENTRY CONTRACT READS BACK, at the
   [UmodeAbi] indices (= [mword_of_int 2] / 10 / 11, spelled here as the
   literals so this file stays off the Umode tier).

   [sp] is the stack budget's base -- every verified program asks for a
   writable run below its entry sp.  [a0] and [a1] are the ABI's argc and
   argv: a program that READS its arguments (echo does; sync does not)
   needs them off the trapframe, since the slot's key is the trapframe and
   nothing else.  They are trapframe words [tf_sp_idx] and [tf_arg_idx 0/1]
   -- and note that [a0] is the LAST insert of [userret_gpr]'s tower (the
   syscall return value overwrites it), so its peel is the shortest.

   All three go through the same discipline: peel with [apply] at explicit
   arguments until the key matches, and never [rewrite upd_eq]. *)

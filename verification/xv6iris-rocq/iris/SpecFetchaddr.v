     int fetchaddr(uint64 addr, uint64 *ip) {
       struct proc *p = myproc();
       if (addr >= p->sz || addr + sizeof(uint64) > p->sz)
         return -1;                 // both tests needed, in case of overflow
       if (copyin(p->pagetable, p->sz, (char * )ip, addr, sizeof( *ip)) != 0)

       return 0;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.fetchaddr = 0x8000277a, 26 instructions / 74 bytes; a 32-byte
   frame with all four slots used (ra / s0 / s1 = addr / s2 = ip).

   THE ALTITUDE.  fetchaddr is the first function that spans the two tiers
   the [struct proc] work has kept apart: it is a [proc_priv] consumer (it
   calls myproc() and reads two of the private fields) whose whole body is a
   call to copyin, which is stated one tier DOWN over the bare [p_sz] /
   [p_pagetable] cells plus [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt].  [ProcInv.proc_priv_copy] is
   that bridge, and the shape of this spec follows from it:

   - the process comes back with its descriptor EXTENDED ([uptd_ext]: same
     root, same trapframe, a user map that only gained entries), because
     copyin may fault pages in on the way.  Everything else about the block
     is unchanged, which is what [upd_upt] says;
   - [p->sz <= MAXVA] is NOT a premise here.  It is a premise of copyin, of
     copyout and of vmfault, all of which take the bare cell -- but a caller
     at THIS altitude holds nothing but [proc_priv], so it could not
     discharge one.  The bound lives in [proc_priv] instead and this proof
     pays copyin's premise out of it.

   WHAT *ip GETS.  On the answer 0, THE PROCESS'S OWN WORD at [addr]:
   copyin is memory-indexed ([SpecCopyin.copyin_got] names byte [j] at
   [addr + j] of the block's image) and [ByteBuf.bb_word_acc]'s rebuild
   ties the eight bytes to the value the caller reads back, so
   [fetchaddr_got] below says the word IS
   [SpecCopyin.uimg_word_at (us_M U) (uint addr)].  The two arms of
   [fetchaddr_post] are:

   - the range test failed: [*ip] is untouched (fetchaddr returned before
     calling copyin), and the answer is -1;
   - the range test passed: the caller owns [*ip] holding some [w], and
     [fetchaddr_got] pins [w] on the 0 arm.  On -1 it pins nothing -- a
     copyin that gives up part-way has already written a prefix, so the
     value is only ownership there, which is the copy family's failure arm
     exactly ([SpecFetchstr.fetchstr_got], keyed on the answer).

   ONE SPEC, NOT TWO.  There is no ∃-weakened twin: a caller that does not
   care about the value simply drops the clause.

   THE RETURN VALUE IS NOT AN UNCONSTRAINED DISJUNCTION.  [r = 0] implies the
   second arm, i.e. [fetch_ok addr (pv_sz V)] -- a caller that gets 0 learns
   the whole doubleword lay inside the process's address space.  It cannot
   learn more: copyin's own contract permits failure (an unmapped page that
   vmfault declines to back), so "returns 0" is not a function of the inputs
   the way argfd's answer is. *)

   collapse to ONE arithmetic condition, because a [addr] that survives the
   first test is below 2^38 and [addr + 8] cannot then wrap.  ProofFetchaddr's

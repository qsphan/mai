(* ---- 9e.   THE INDUCTION: EVERY NON-TOKENLESS ENTRY BEARS A TICKET ---- *)

(*  Generic in the ticket function, so nothing here knows about an image:
    the RA's [FsStateInode.ent_elem] and a ticket are compared record by
    record.  The premise is the WHOLE content of the bridge -- a record
    that WINS its name and owes a token has a ticket naming the same inum
    -- and the induction is [DirView.dir_view]'s own one-step recursion,
    which adds at most one entry at a name the prefix does not carry, so
    [big_opM_insert] applies and no multiset argument is needed.

    ONE NAME IS EXEMPT ([ex], durable-disk G5).  Under the TYPE REGISTER a
    directory's [.] record owes a fragment -- it is what pins the parent in
    [FsStateInode.ent_ty_ok] -- and [FsImg.fs_rec_ticket] does not ticket
    it, because it names its own home.  Rather than count the exempt record
    against the ticket supply, the caller DELETES its name from the map and
    covers that one fragment out of the multiplicity's own [+1] for a live
    directory.  At [ex] a name no record carries this is the plain
    statement.                                                             *)

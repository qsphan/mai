(* PrintkFmt.v -- the PURE model of printk's format string: which varargs a
   format string consumes, and in what order.  No Iris, no WP -- this is the
   vocabulary SpecPrintk.v states printk's precondition in, and the recursion
   ProofPrintk.v runs its loop induction on.

   printk reads its format string one character at a time and, at a '%', looks
   at up to three more characters (c0, c1, c2) to pick an arm:

       %d  %ld  %lld  %u  %lu  %llu  %x  %lx  %llx  %p  %c   -> one vararg
       %s                                                    -> one char* vararg
       %%                                                    -> no vararg
       %<anything else>                                      -> no vararg

   Each arm then advances the index past the characters it recognized, and the
   loop continues.  [pk_dir] is that classification -- the vararg an arm
   consumes plus how many characters BEYOND c0 it eats -- and [pk_kinds] runs it
   over a whole format string to produce the list of varargs, in order.

   Two modelling points worth stating, because both are load-bearing in the WP:

   - The C code reads c1 only when c0 is non-NUL, and c2 only when c1 is
     non-NUL, so it never reads past the terminator.  [pk_kinds] mirrors that by
     matching on how much string is actually left, and passes the NUL character
     for the ones that would be off the end -- which is exactly the [c1 = c2 = 0]
     the code assigns.
   - The whole model assumes the format string contains no embedded NUL
     ([nonul]).  That is not a restriction on real format strings, but it must
     be said: [a ↦ₛ{dq} s] resides |s|+1 bytes, and if [s] itself contained a
     NUL the C string at [a] would be a strict PREFIX of [s] -- so the loop
     would stop somewhere [pk_kinds s] knows nothing about. *)

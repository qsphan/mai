(* HartPilot.v -- PHASE B's PILOT: one real kernel instruction proven
   boundary-to-boundary through the per-node kit, at a concrete machine
   state, with the certification in the finding-F8 form (unevaluated cursor
   compositions + small VM-checked projections).  The instruction is
   [sw a4,0(a5)] = 0xc398 at [main+0xb0] -- the same instruction the weak
   branch's spike measured (WeakEvStarted §5).

   ITS FETCH IS A 2-BYTE READ SINCE 06ea57f, and that is the one thing the
   bump changed here.  The instruction, its offset in main and even its two
   bytes are identical; but panic shrank by 30 bytes, so main moved -0x1e --
   an ODD multiple of 2 -- and [main+0xb0] went from 0x80000ee0 (4-aligned,
   ONE 4-byte fetch that also grabbed the next instruction's [b771]) to
   0x80000ec2 (2-aligned, so [fetch] takes the 2-byte arm and [isRVC] ends
   it there).  See execution-model.md "Fetch geometry", and its standing
   warning that an odd-halfword shift flips PARITY and not just addresses.
   [wp_hart_rw_seq] is parametric in the fetch width, so the instance moved
   from [nf = 4] to [nf = 2] and nothing else about the kit did.  The first
   stretch's node count moved with it, 106 -> 107, and the measurement now
   reads 107/178/8 -- which is the weak branch's spike (WeakEvStarted §5)
   EXACTLY, where before the bump it was one node off.  The spike measured
   this instruction at a 2-aligned pc; the parity flip did not break the
   comparison, it completed it.

   WHAT THIS FILE IS EVIDENCE FOR (and what it is not).  It exercises every
   kit piece end to end -- restart is the caller's context, then
   batch / RAM-read event / batch / RAM-write event / batch / boundary --
   and it is the measurement anchor for the ≤1.2× parity criterion.  It is
   NOT the certification adapter: the register file here is CONCRETE
   ([ColdBoot.cold_regs] patched at PC/x14/x15), where the tree's leaves are
   symbolic in the data values.  The adapter (worklist item 2) is where
   symbolic certification is consumed; this file is the kit's smoke test and
   clock.

   THE CONCRETE STATE RULE (measured on the spike, kept): the file must be
   the machine's own -- over a small reference file the run TRAPS (no PMA
   regions ⇒ no fetch) and certifies nothing. *)

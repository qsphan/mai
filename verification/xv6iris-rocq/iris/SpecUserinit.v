(* SpecUserinit.v -- the public interface of userinit() (kernel/proc.c).
   PROVEN: [ProofUserinit.v] discharges it, [LinkUserinit.v] links it.

     void userinit(void) {
       struct proc *p = allocproc();
       initproc = p;
       p->cwd = namei("/");
       p->state = RUNNABLE;
       release(&p->lock);
     }

   (THIS KERNEL'S userinit, read off [CodeUserinit.v]: twenty-two
   instructions, three calls and two stores.  Upstream's uvmfirst /
   trapframe / safestrcpy lines are not in this image and the decode is what
   says so.)

   ---- THIS FILE USED TO BE AN ASSUMED CONTRACT.  IT IS NOT ANY MORE. ----

   The axiom that stood here assumed userinit's WHOLE BODY, on the grounds
   that namei "drags in the whole file-system cone".  It does not:
   [namei("/")] is a path of one separator, so [skipelem] returns 0 on its
   first call, the walk's body never runs, and the only callee reached is
   [iget(ROOTDEV, ROOTINO)].  What is assumed now is exactly that one call,
   at the premises the boot client can produce
   ([SpecNameiRootBoot.NAMEI_ROOT_BOOT], whose header is the inventory) --
   four persistent inode-cache rows short of a contract the tree already
   proves.  Everything else about userinit is a theorem.

   ---- WHAT IT TAKES ------------------------------------------------------

   THE COUNTED PROC REGIME is the headline.  userinit does NOT test
   allocproc's result -- it stores through the returned pointer at +0x24 --
   so the proof has to REFUTE allocproc's empty-table arm, and
   [ProcAvail.procs_avail (Some (S k))] is the only thing that can
   (claude-notes/kernel-defects.md, "UNREACHABLE, BY THE CALLER'S
   POSITION").  It is threaded exactly as [kalloc_env] is and comes back one
   slot lighter.  The page budget is the same story for allocproc's two
   freeproc failure tails: [K_allocproc < nb] refutes both.

   THE [nextpid] LOCK is allocproc's own premise, and main builds it out of
   procinit's [lk_fresh] and the .data cell (durable-notes.md, "A WRITABLE
   GLOBAL INSIDE THE LOADED IMAGE...").

   THE ONE [iref_slot] namei's [iget] spends is NOT a premise: allocproc
   hands back [iref_slots (1 + IREFSPARE)] and the [1] is exactly it.  In
   kfork that unit pays for [idup]; here it pays for the root's [iget], and
   in both cases it is the working directory's.

   ---- WHAT COMES BACK ----------------------------------------------------

   NOTHING ABOUT THE FIRST PROCESS CROSSES BACK OUT: main does not use
   [initproc], and the process userinit made is reached by the scheduler
   through [procs_inv], which is persistent and rides in unchanged.  The
   RUNNABLE park swallows the private block, the fd allowance and the saved
   context; the [initproc] cell comes back at an unspecified value and
   PERSISTENT (userinit's store is the last write it ever gets), and the
   two counted regimes come back one unit down.

   THE PAGE COUNT COMES BACK EXISTENTIALLY ([nc <= K_allocproc]) rather than
   at a fixed subtraction: allocproc's own post reports what it spent, and
   inventing a round number here would be [claude-notes/durable-notes.md]'s
   "a numeral that silently encodes another constant's value".

   THE FTABLE'S GNAME DOES NOT APPEAR.  allocproc's post mentions it (in
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_nocwd]) and so does [FORKRET_PARK], but the block
   userinit hands over has every descriptor null, so nothing about the open
   file table is observable in this contract; the proof instantiates both
   callees at one arbitrary name. *)

     userinit is the COURIER, not a consumer: it reads none of these three
     and spends none of them.  They are here because the ONE place the boot
     token can be staged is the park userinit performs on the first process
     -- forkret runs on that park's saved context, and its [if (first)] arm
     is the token's only consumer.  main holds all three at +0x9e
     ([ProofMain.mn_grp_fs]) and cannot stage them itself: main never parks
     anything.

     THE CELL IS PINNED, not existential, and that is the whole point: it
     is `static int first = 1`, one of the image's two writable initialized
     .data words, carved at [BootShared.v]'s boot data run and threaded
     pinned through the boot chain.  A holder of [∃ w, first_addr ↦₄ w]
     could not tell which arm of forkret's branch it is in.

     STAGED, NOT YET PASSED.  Until D1 lands ([SpecForkretPark]'s package
     grows a [FirstTok.first_tok] row -- the humans' seam), the proof holds
     these to the [forkret_park] call site and drops them there; the loud

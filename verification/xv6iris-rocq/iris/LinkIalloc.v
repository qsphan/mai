(* LinkIalloc.v -- the only file where ialloc's proof meets its callees'.
   All five (bread, log_write, brelse, memset and iget) are PROVEN, so
   nothing here is assumed:

   - bread / log_write / brelse arrive through their own Link files, the
     same instances iupdate and balloc use;
   - memset is the WHOLE-FUNCTION spec [MemsetArray] (LinkMemsetArray),
     not the [MEMSET_PARTS] module [Memset] -- ialloc's [memset(dip,0,64)]
     is an arbitrary 64-byte fill, not a page;
   - iget arrives through LinkIget.v (acquire / release), i.e. the same
     instance dirlookup's tail call uses.

   ialloc's ONE dead arm -- the [bgeu a4,a5] at +0x12, the empty-region
   exit, refuted from the contract's [1 < ninodes] exactly as balloc's
   [beqz a5] at the same offset is refuted from [0 < size] -- is refuted
   inside the proof, so no panic contract is instantiated here.  The
   [kernel_data] / [panic_env] the contract takes are threaded to bread,
   log_write, brelse and iget, whose own panic arms are theirs.

   Interrupts are OFF throughout (the child's lock, taken by allocproc, is
   still held): every leaf and every callee's own [wp_next] collapses via
   [wp_next_off_intro] at the FIXED hart [CID0], so nothing here ever
   transports [cpu_own] or generates a fresh [CpuId].

   Straight line, two calls, no branches -- so this file never states
   [callee_saved] wrt the WHOLE FUNCTION's entry map, only wrt THIS block's
   own entry map [m].  [s1] is the one callee-saved register this block
   itself overwrites (with the child's pid); every other callee-saved
   register survives because idup and safestrcpy each promise their own
   [callee_saved] and neither touches [s1].

   THE RESOURCE STORY.  [p->cwd] names icache slot [ck] ([pv_cwd Vp = ientry
   ck], a premise of kfork's own contract because [ProcInv.cwd_ref] is [emp]
   and cannot produce idup's argument -- see SpecKfork.v's header).  idup
   hands back TWO halves of [inode_ref ck (cq/2) icfg_dev cinum]; this block
   keeps one and drops the other (the child's [cwd_ref] is [emp], so there
   is nowhere to put it).  safestrcpy's characterisation of the child's
   new name bytes ([ssc_stop]/[ssc_post]) USED TO BE dropped on the way out.
   It is not any more: [ProcDefs.pname_cells] carries [ProcGeom.pname_wf]
   ("there is a NUL in p->name") and [kfk_name_wf] reads it straight off that
   disjunction -- [ssc_post]'s zero at the stop index, [ssc_stop]'s index
   inside the buffer.  The child's final block is still handed back as an
   EXISTENTIAL [Vc'] agreeing with [Vc] on every field except [pv_cwd] (now
   [ientry ck]) and [pv_name] (now some list of length [PNAMELEN], and
   NUL-terminated).

   [ProcInv.v] has an accessor for [p->cwd] ([proc_priv_cwd]) but none for
   [p->name]; [kfk_name_open] below is the missing one, built by hand
   exactly the way [proc_priv_cwd] is (open [proc_fields], peel off
   [pname_cells], rebuild with the other six record fields carried
   through) -- see the header note on [kfk_name_open] for why a
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_name] accessor of this shape would be worth adding
   upstream. *)

     This is what the hole that used to sit here has become.  While
     [ProcInv.cwd_ref] was [emp] the child's reference could be conjured at
     any [v] and idup's result was dropped on the floor; now the two
     are the same predicate and the store at +0xac consumes it, which
     is the whole reason idup returns one.  No coherence premise is needed
     to tie the itable the caller holds the LOCK for to the authority
     [cwd_ref] is stated over: both are the same canonical
     [IcacheInv.iref_name] by construction ([InodeRef.v]'s header explains
     why). *)

(* FsAbsMknodFire.v -- THE mknod/create AU's FIRE POINTS, DISCHARGED
   AGAINST THE INVARIANT, plus the two bridges the contract's prover needs:
   the reading bridge at the parent-row update and the halfword tie on the
   device numbers.

   ==== WHY THE COMMITS ARE SHAPED AT THE AUTHORITY ======================

   A commit stated over [FsAbs.astate],

       astate Γ av ={E}=∗ astate Γ av ∗ Φ ...                (dlookup)
       astate Γ av ={E}=∗ astate Γ av ∗ (astate Γ (δ av) ={E}=∗ ...)  (acre)

   is NOT dischargeable, and the obstruction is a shape finding rather
   than a proof gap.  The prover's only source of [astate] is the γtop
   authority inside [InodeRegion.ftop_inv].  Borrowing it
   ([FsAbs.ftop_astate_ro] / [ftop_astate_acc]) is fine; GIVING IT BACK is
   not.  [astate Γ av] is [∃ I, ghost_map_auth_frac (γtop Γ) 1 I ∗
   ⌜av = abs_view I⌝], and [abs_view] IS NOT INJECTIVE ([abs_of] forgets
   the record: the block map, the size's slack, every field [inode_local]
   constrains).  So what comes back out of a caller's fupd is an authority
   at SOME map with the right reading -- and [ftop_body]'s row
   ([ftop_clean I A]) is a statement about the RECORDS.  Neither give-back
   wand can be paid:

     - [ftop_astate_ro]'s wants the SAME [I] the borrow named, and nothing
       in [astate Γ av] says the returned map is that one;
     - [ftop_astate_acc]'s wants [inode_local] at EVERY entry of whatever
       map comes back, which is exactly the fact [abs_view] threw away.

   So the commits ([FsAbsCreateFire], re-exported below) take the RAW MAP
   and hand the very same [ghost_map_auth_frac] back.  Everything a client
   wants of them is offered at that shape: the trivial-receipt units, and
   the agreement seeds ([_pinned]) the stable corollaries are derived from.

   ==== WHAT THE TWO FIRE LEMMAS DO ====================================

   [mkf_dlookup_fire] and [caf_acre_fire] are the two fire points as ONE
   step each, [ftopN] opened and closed inside.  The resource they read
   the row off is NOT a walk's lend but the FIRING FUNCTION'S OWN era
   fragment -- create holds [FsState.top_frag] for the parent inside
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] across both its dirlookup and its dirlink, so
   no seam is needed at these two instants at all (that is why they are
   dischargeable while [FsAbsEraMknod]'s hop-side twins needed the era
   walk).  [caf_acre_fire] (section 5) FUSES the parent-row retag: the two
   phases and the [ghost_map_update] are one [ftopN] critical section, so
   the pair is ONE instant to every other party, and it pays the row
   obligation [InodeRegion.ireg_top_retag_*] charges every mover -- so a
   walk at the parent calls THIS instead of [ireg_top_retag_*], with one
   extra premise (the caller's commit) and one extra payout (the receipt).

   ==== THE TWO BRIDGES =================================================

   [mkf_parent_row] is the reading bridge (item 2): the written parent
   record's abstract row.  Its real half -- [dir_entries] of the appended
   record is [<[nm := i]>] of the old one -- is ALREADY LANDED as
   [FsStateEra.dir_entries_dirlink_ins], so this lemma takes that equation
   as a premise and does the [abs_of] arithmetic around it.
   [mkf_child_dev] is item 4's abstract half ([FsAbsCreateFire.create_made]
   read through [abs_of]) and [mkf_low16_mod] / [mkf_dev_arg] are its
   bit-level half: the low halfword of the [argint]'d word, read unsigned,
   IS [SysMknodDefs.dev_arg].

   BINDERS: [SysMknodDefs]'s section list VERBATIM -- [fileG] is bound
   and [icacheG]/[icfg] resolve only through its fields (SpecCreate's
   header: a standalone [icfg] beside [fileG] gives two instance paths and
   the propositions print identically while failing to unify). *)


(* ==== WHAT IS IN THIS FILE (the mknod/create leaves, fused 2026-08-30) ==

   ONE FILE FOR THE mknod/create AU's ABSTRACT-STATE WORK.  Four leaves were
   one lane's, split only by the build mirror's rule that a tracked file is
   not touched -- and three of the four headers below say, in as many
   words, to fuse them the next time one of them is edited.  This is that
   edit.  Every statement and proof is the original text, in its original
   section at its original binder list (and all four sections take the SAME
   binder list, which is what made them one file's worth of work):

     sections 1-4  the authority-shaped commits, the two fires and the
                   halfword bridge -- this file's own.
     section 5     the era-lend walk predicates -- WAS
                   iris/FsAbsEraMknod.v.
     section 6     the nameiparent acceptance test -- WAS
                   iris/FsAbsNparMknod.v.
     section 7     FIRE 2 at a non-directory child -- WAS
                   iris/FsAbsCreateFire.v.

   NOT FUSED, AND IT IS NOT A JUDGEMENT CALL: the other fire leaves
   ([FsAbsOpenFire], [FsAbsWriteFire], [FsAbsUnlinkFire], [FsAbsReadFire])
   each stand on a DIFFERENT [Spec*AU] contract, and three of those
   contracts require THIS file -- so merging any of them here is a
   dependency CYCLE, not a tidy-up.  One fire leaf per syscall is the
   shape the cone forces.

   All three old names survive as stubs that [Require Export] this file, so
   no consumer moved. *)

(*      (was iris/FsAbsNparMknod.v, fused 2026-08-30)                      *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* THE ACCEPTANCE TEST, DISCHARGED (was iris/FsAbsNparMknod.v): the two
   walk predicates above are exactly what the nameiparent era walk's
   contract ([SpecNparEra]) consumes and produces.

   THREE FACTS, and two of them are [reflexivity].

   (1) THE FAMILIES ARE THE SAME FAMILY.  [FsAbsNpar.np_elems pl] and
       [SysMknodDefs.npar_elems pl] are both
       [removelast (path_elems pl)] -- so [ep_hops_from] and the
       [ax_hops_from] inside [npar_walk_pre_era] are the same big-op, and
       the walk's trace premise IS what the syscall's one-shot hands out.
       This is not a coincidence to be maintained: it is why the npar
       contract ranges over the parent prefix at all (FsAbsNpar's header).

   (2) THE PRE.  [np_pre_of_mknod] fires the one-shot at the string the
       walk fetched and at [ROOTINO], which is where an ABSOLUTE fetch
       starts.  The two [ROOTINO]s -- [InodeInv.ROOTINO : mword 32], read
       off namex's [li a1,1], and [FsImg.ROOTINO : Z], the image's --
       agree by computation.  [np_start_of_mknod] is the general form the
       walk actually takes: the START INUM is the walk's to choose, so no
       firing happens at all.

   (3) THE DEAD.  This one is NOT an identity, and the mismatch is worth
       recording rather than papering over.  [npar_walk_dead_era] bounds
       its death index STRICTLY ([k < length ps]) in BOTH disjuncts; the
       walk can die at [k = length ps], because namex runs the level's
       type test and nlink guard at the PARENT's own level too
       ([FsAbsNpar]'s header, case (1)), and at [k = 0 = length ps] when
       the path has no elements at all (case (2)).  So the honest
       statement is a DISJUNCTION: either the predicate above, or the
       cursor at the parent index -- and the second alternative is exactly
       what [SpecCreate.cre_fail_arms]'s walk-death arm carries, which a
       create that never got to dirlink refunds anyway.  So mknod's post is
       dischargeable as it stands; what is NOT true is that
       [npar_walk_dead_era] alone covers the walk's failures. *)

Require Import CtxIdDefs.

(* FsAbsCreateFire.v -- the create AU's SUCCESS FIRE AT A NON-DIRECTORY
   CHILD, and the [T_FILE] row reading that instantiates it.

   Worklist: claude-notes/projects/fs-syscall-specs.md, lane W (the T_FILE
   create-AU carry).  (WAS A LEAF, iris/FsAbsCreateFire.v, for the mirror's
   reason the campaign's other leaves record: the build mirror forbids
   touching a tracked file.  FUSED IN 2026-08-30 -- "fuse the fire leaves
   when one of them is next edited", as far as the cone allows: the OTHER
   fire leaves each stand on a different syscall's statement leaf, and each
   of those requires this file, so they cannot follow without a cycle.)

   ==== WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ============================================

   THE SUCCESS FIRE IS STATED AT AN ARBITRARY NON-[ADir] CHILD, not at a
   device.  The delta's collapse is discharged with
   [SysMknodDefs.delta_create_dev], the "under [cre_pre] with a DEVICE
   child, the fused delta IS the one-row parent insert" lemma; reading
   that lemma's proof shows the device-ness is not used -- what is used is
   that the child is NOT A DIRECTORY, which is what makes
   [SysMknodDefs.acre_bump] zero (so the parent's count does not move)
   and what makes [cre_pre_ne] separate parent from child (so the child's
   insert is the identity on its already-minted row).

   So the two lemmas below are the [ADev]-free forms:

     [caf_delta_create_nondir]  -- [delta_create_dev] at any non-[ADir] [c]
     [caf_acre_fire]            -- the success fire, fused with the
                                   parent-row retag, at any non-[ADir] [c]

   and [caf_child_file] is the [T_FILE] instance of the minted child's row
   ([FsAbsMknodFire.mkf_child_dev]'s twin): [FsAbsCreateFire.create_made T_FILE
   major minor] reads as [AFile []] at nlink 1, because that record's size
   is zero and [fn_file_bytes] of a zero-size node is [file_bytes _ 0 = []]
   -- the same arithmetic [FsAbsOpenFire.opf_trunc_bytes] does at itrunc's
   own zeroing.

   BINDERS: [FsAbsMknodFire]'s section list VERBATIM (which is
   [SysMknodDefs]'s) -- [fileG] is bound and [icacheG]/[icfg] resolve
   only through its fields (SpecCreate's header: a standalone [icfg] beside
   [fileG] gives two instance paths and the propositions print identically
   while failing to unify). *)

   third conjunct already observes, and [cre_pre_ne] is what keeps the two
   inserts from being at the same key. *)

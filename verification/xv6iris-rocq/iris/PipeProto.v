(* PipeProto.v -- THE PER-PIPE PROTOCOL: one invariant that three processes
   share, so that the bytes a pipe carries are the application's own ghost
   state and the pipeline's round can be READ OFF the two children's exit
   payloads.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-pipe.md SS3 ("The protocol: one
   invariant per pipe, three processes") and SS4.2 ("The round closes at sh,
   from the two exit payloads"), over claude-notes/design/pipe.md ("The byte
   queue").  Lane PIPE-PROTO.

   WHO HOLDS WHAT.  sh's runcmd child allocates the protocol right after
   pipe(2) ([pipe_proto_alloc]), keeps the two SIDE TOKENS and hands the
   WRITE PERMIT to the left child (echo) and the READ PERMIT to the right
   child (cat) through the exec channel.  Nobody ever holds the pipe's queue
   FRAGMENT again: it lives in the invariant, which is why a row on this
   pipe can be closed by anybody at any time ([pipe_reg_of_inv], the
   registration [PipeReg] asks for) and why a dup'd or forked copy of a row
   costs nothing.

   THE THREE PROPERTIES, at the body:

     (P1)  ps_ws s `prefix_of` L         -- only the line ever goes in
     (P2)  the write permit at 0 forces ps_ws s = []   (derived, see below)
     (P3)  after end-of-file the contents are FROZEN: the reader's one-shot
           snapshot [eof_shot pn w] says w = ps_ws s and ps_wo s = false

   (P3) is preserved by a write link only because the link carries
   [ps_wo s = true] (lane PQ-FLAG, design SS3.1): a write link cannot fire at
   a state whose write end is shut, and a snapshot is only taken at such a
   state.  That ONE premise is the whole of the freeze.

   TWO CORRECTIONS TO THE DESIGN, both forced at the STATEMENT and both
   recorded in claude-notes/projects/app-pipe.md:

   1. THE EXACTNESS OF A CURSOR IS AN EXCLUSIVE RESOURCE, not an arithmetic
      consequence of a lower bound.  Design SS3 hoped the chain's [Q j] could
      pin [ps_ws s = take j L] from "a [mono_list] lower bound of length j
      plus (P1)"; it cannot -- a lower bound and (P1) together give only
      [take j L `prefix_of` ps_ws s `prefix_of` L], i.e. [ps_ws s = take k L]
      for SOME k >= j, and the writer's node needs k = j to know which byte
      of L it is appending.  What pins it is that the writer is the ONLY
      writer, and the only way to say that in the logic is an exclusive
      permit that CARRIES the cursor.  So the protocol has a write cursor
      [wcur pn c] (half of a [ghost_var_frac]; the body holds the other half at
      [length (ps_ws s)]) and, symmetrically, a read cursor [rcur pn c] at
      [ps_rp s].  They compose across echo's several [write]s and cat's
      several [read]s, which is exactly what the design asked the builders
      for.
   2. (P2) AND [wtok_spent] ARE THEN UNNECESSARY.  The design's (P2)
      (["ps_ws s = []"] or the persistent "the token went in") exists to let
      sh conclude "echo never wrote" from the start token; with the cursor
      that is [wcur pn 0] against the body's [wcur pn (length (ps_ws s))],
      one [ghost_var_frac] agreement ([pipe_body_P2] below).  So [wtok pn] IS the
      write permit at 0, no one-shot is minted for it, and the body has one
      conjunct fewer.

   The reader's start permit ([rtok]) is the design's third omission: SS3
   lists only [wtok] among what [pipe_proto_alloc] hands out, and without a
   read permit cat's chain cannot pin [ps_rp s] either.

  (*  4b.  THE DERAILED CHAIN: what a writer pays AFTER a short write      *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

  (* THE WALL ECHO-PIPE FOUND: echo's four writes do not compose past a
     write that stopped SHORT, because the next chain's nodes would have to
     re-establish (P1) with bytes that no longer continue the pipe's
     contents.  Design SS3.1b's ruling closes it from the OTHER side: once
     (P4)'s shot is out, every write link is VACUOUS -- it is handed
     [⌜ps_ro s = true⌝] (lane PQ-FLAG-2) and the shot says [ps_ro s = false].
     So a chain past a short write needs NO cursor, NO lower bound, NO bound
     on the count and NO knowledge of the caller's bytes: the nodes' [Q]/[Qe]
     can be ANY single resource [R] the caller is willing to carry through,
     because the additive conjunction hands the same [R] to the node's value
     and to its observation and the link branch is never taken.

     This is the exact mirror of (P3)'s refutation by [⌜ps_wo s = true⌝] in
     [pipe_wchain_of_inv] -- and it is why the derailed builder must NOT
     carry [wcur]: [pipe_wQ] pins [ps_ws s] through [wcur_agree], which is
     precisely the knowledge a derailed writer has lost. *)

     [UShPipeAssembly.pipe_round_reading_at], generalised to a pipe whose
     WRITER is any stage (echo, or a middle cat that copied a prefix [D])
     and whose READER end is a cat followed by an sh node that holds the
     read end until it exits (design SS0, point 2).  That last fact is
     what makes the reader's outcome the SUFFIX's and not one process's:
     the node's right child relays the reader cat's end ([rd_final]) in
     its own exit payload, and the read end is shut only once that whole
     suffix has gone -- which is the order the first-ender exclusion (P6)
     records, and why a halted writer never pairs with an end of file.

     The two symmetric exit payloads carry each end's outcome with an
     arbitrary EXTRA ([XW] / [XR]: the stage's console cursors, the
     suffix's writer tokens, whatever the node's instance needs); the
     reading decides the pair in ONE invariant access and hands every
     resource back, beside the two side tokens.  At [U = True],
     [XW]/[XR] the landed family's halves and the writer echo, this is

(* SpecInitlog.v -- the public interface of initlog, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void initlog(int dev, struct superblock *sb) {
       initlock(&log.lock, "log");
       log.start = sb->logstart;
       log.dev   = dev;
       recover_from_log();            // INLINED, and read_head with it
     }
     static void read_head(void) {
       struct buf *buf = bread(log.dev, log.start);
       struct logheader *lh = (struct logheader * ) buf->data;
       log.lh.n = lh->n;
       for (int i = 0; i < log.lh.n; i++) log.lh.block[i] = lh->block[i];
       brelse(buf);
     }
     static void recover_from_log(void) {
       read_head(); install_trans(1); log.lh.n = 0; write_head();
     }

   (The C's [if (sizeof(struct logheader) >= BSIZE) panic(...)] is
   compile-time false and is not in the image: initlog has no panic site of
   its own.)

   THE CONSTRUCTOR.  initlog is where the whole log layer comes into
   existence: it is handed the RAW material -- the .bss-zeroed [struct log]
   cells, the superblock field naming the log's start block, the FsBlocks
   authorities and the log region's client halves -- and its postcondition
   is the persistent [log_ctx], the context every other log.c function
   takes.

   AND IT FILLS A [log_names] IT IS GIVEN (claude-notes/projects/
   fs-cfg-boot.md, THE PRINCIPLE).  The four gnames used to be minted
   INSIDE the proof and returned as [∃ γ : log_names, log_ctx ...]; they
   are now a PARAMETER, and the premise [LogDefs.log_free_tok γ] is the
   era fupd's receipt for having minted them at their genesis values (the
   empty ledger, epoch one, the empty append registry, and the "log"
   spinlock's free ghost state).  The reason is [IcacheRefDefs.icfg_log]: the
   configuration record names the log's gnames as an AMBIENT field, so
   they must exist before any proof runs, and an ambient field cannot be a
   WP-time existential.  The contract stays GENERAL in [γ] -- it is the
   era fupd, not this statement, that instantiates [γ := icfg_log].

   THIS CONTRACT IS GENERAL IN [n], AND HAS BEEN SINCE durable-disk 1a.
   There is NO clean-image premise: the header decodes to whatever it
   decodes to, read_head's copy loop is LIVE, [install_trans(1)] installs
   every entry, and the closing [write_head] clears a header that said [n].
   What the contract asks about the header instead is [FsCrash.hdr_wf] at
   the block's content (the three pure conjuncts below) -- true of a clean
   image for free and delivered by the durable header invariant at a real
   crash.

   WHAT REAL RECOVERY COSTS THE CALLER, and it is the whole of what is left
   of fs-log.md stage 4 item (1): initlog takes the ENTRIES' HOME BYTE RUNS
   ([Bh i] below) and hands them back at the INSTALLED contents, because the
   recovering install moves the logged view [L] from the crashed bytes to
   the slots' logged bytes, one entry at a time.  A caller therefore has to
   OWN the pending home blocks' byte elements across the call.  [fsinit] --
   the only caller -- cannot: at a dirty log the pending set is not confined
   to [FirstTok]'s coverage remainder, and every other home block's byte
   elements were spent into the era's file-system instance at PowerOn.  That
   is why [SpecFsinit] still carries [hdr_n bs_hdr = 0] and this file does
   not; see SpecFsinit.v's premise (g) for the measurement and the two
   exits.

   WHAT COMES IN, PIECE BY PIECE.
     - the two ARGUMENTS: a0 = dev (sign-extended, RV64 ABI), a1 = sb, plus
       a fraction of [sb->logstart] at offset 20 -- read once at +0x28 and
       handed straight back.
     - the RAW spinlock cells of [struct log] (the lock is its first member,
       so &log.lock = &log) plus [kernel_data], out of which the proof reads
       the "log" string literal at [log_name_str] -- the SpecBinit /
       SpecIinit pattern.
     - the REST of struct log's cells.  [log.outstanding] and
       [log.committing] arrive AT ZERO: initlog never writes them, and the
       invariant needs them zero, which is exactly the .bss guarantee for a
       static object.  Everything else arrives at an arbitrary value
       (initlog overwrites start/dev/lh.n; lh.block[] is only written by the
       dead copy loop, so all thirty slots come in -- and go into the batch
       -- as junk).
     - the FsBlocks material: both authorities (they become the batch's
       freeze), the LOG SIDE's dirty halves over the whole covered range at
       [false] (the payloads hold the other halves), and the log region's
       CLIENT halves -- the header block at [bs_hdr] and the thirty slots at
       arbitrary content.  The log is its own client for exactly those
       blocks.
     - the SLOT POOL to stock, plus a working pair: [bslots 34].  Thirty
       two of them ([(LOGBLOCKS - 0) + 2]) go into [log_state]'s pool and
       stay sealed inside the lock; the pair comes back.  (initlog itself
       only ever holds one buffer, but the [install_trans] contract asks for
       two even on the dead path.)

   The heavy assembly (raw cells + material -> [log_res] -> sealed lock) is
   the PROOF's ghost step, not part of this statement.

   initlog sleeps (bread / brelse, and write_head's bwrite), so it threads
   the full running-process bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does, plus the
   disk fabric and [bio_ctx]; it enters and returns at noff 0. *)

     porting guide's "a PARKING function's [wp_next] index is [true]
     UNCONDITIONALLY".  Spelled [b] the two coincide at the only instance
     the [eb = true] premise admits, which is why this went unnoticed; once
     [eb = false] is reachable the [b] form would promise the caller it
     comes back on the hart it called from, which a park makes false. *)

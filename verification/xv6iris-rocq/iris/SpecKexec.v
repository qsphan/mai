(* SpecKexec.v -- kexec()'s ONE CONTRACT [KEXEC]: the walk, ONE
   observation of the file, and -- if what was observed is a program xv6
   will load -- the caller's OWN WP for running it.  A STATEMENT FILE:
   definitions, structural lemmas, and a [Module Type] seal; no walk, no
   proof against the machine.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md (the AU
   family: sections 0-4), claude-notes/design/user-wp-slot.md (the slot
   [UexecRet.uslot] this contract's conclusion is keyed at -- through the
   SLOT PREDICATE [S] below -- and the ruled trap contract whose exec arm
   this fills), claude-notes/design/elf.md
   (the file-side ELF semantics [ElfFile.elf_image]), and the owner's
   2026-09-03 brief: "the caller must supply fupds for the pathname
   resolution and the reads of the resulting file; after those translate
   into some ELF binary, if that binary is valid the caller must provide
   the WP for starting execution of the u-mode process -- the WP the
   u-mode slot wants -- and that is how u-mode WPs chain: init proving
   the fupds for exec("sh") concludes in the WP for running sh."

   The mold is SysOpenDefs.v (the era walk premise, the single-phase
   whole-[anode] observation, the exclusion-by-premise pattern).

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ==========================================

   THE ONLY CONTRACT kexec has, and the only seal any caller may take:
   [KexecDefs.v] below is the vocabulary leaf ([K_kexec],
   [kexec_ok], the [kxc_*] stack algebra, [fs_fabric]), and the frame
   below is that file's own premise list row for row -- with THREE things
   added on the caller's side and ONE on the kernel's.  A caller that
   wants nothing of the abstract state instantiates [S] at [emp] and the
   bundle at [exec_au_pre_triv], and reads [kexec_ok] back off the arms
   with [exec_arms_landed] -- and a caller that wants the SLOT back and
   nothing else takes [exec_au_pre_triv_at] at [S := uslot], which is what
   the first process's bundle is built from ([InitBoot]); a caller
   that pins the file it is willing to run answers [exec_slot_pre] with
   that program's slot.  Stable and pinned readings are the CALLER's
   business -- derived at the call site from its own [P]/[Phio], never a
   second seal against the code.

   IN (the AU bundle, [exec_au_pre]):
   1. THE WALK PREMISE, [FsAbsEra.ex_start] AT THE PATH IN THE BUFFER:
      kexec resolves the whole path with namei, exactly as open's plain
      arm does, so the one-shot that fires an [ax_hop] at the era lend
      per path element is the same statement -- but at [bview plen pfun]
      and not at every [pl], because a cursor fixed before the path is
      known can say nothing about the inums THIS walk visits.  A caller
      that knows the directory chain (init: "/" holds "sh" at a known
      inum) pins each hop from its own view; a caller that does not
      passes [True] hops, converting the universally quantified form with
      [FsAbsOpenFire.opf_start_of_open].
   2. THE OBSERVATION, [SysOpenDefs.aopen_commit_at] REUSED: ONE
      single-phase read-only commit, fired inside the file's lock
      window, handing the caller the node kexec is about to read AS A
      WHOLE ([anode]: a file's bytes, or a directory / device that will
      fail the magic test).  See THE ONE OBSERVATION below for why this
      is one fupd and not one per readi.
   3. THE PROGRAM'S WP, [exec_slot_pre]: for every observed file [f]
      that xv6 loads ([kexec_loadable f]) and every resume key [W']
      kexec may build from it ([kexec_image_ok f na alen afun sts W']),
      the caller supplies [S W'] -- GIVEN the exec'ing process's pay fact
      AND its exit payload at the kill status, which are what the new
      image's own run is built from (EXEC-PAY; the payload is the
      dispatcher's, [SpecSyscall.sysc_pay_in]) -- [S] a SLOT PREDICATE
      every form below is parametric in, instantiated by the dispatcher
      at the trapframe-keyed user-execution WP ([UexecRet.uslot]: the very
      proposition the trap loop deposits and runs; design note, "the two
      WP forms").  [S] is a parameter and not [uslot] because the exec
      bundle the process hands over ([UexecExecInst.exec_sbundle]) is an
      [exec_au_pre] whose slot wand concludes at the FIXPOINT VARIABLE of
      the enriched trap contract, which is what lets the kernel return
      the U-mode slot.  The caller receives its own
      observation receipt [Fo av i (AFile f)] first, so the WP it owes is
      only for the file it observed: init, whose receipt says
      [f = sh_bytes], owes only sh's start WP at sh's key.

   OUT (the arms, [exec_arms]):
   - ret = argc (SUCCESS).  The walk completed at [i] and the node
     observed there was [a]; then
       (a) [a] is a loadable file [f]: the landed success conjuncts hold
           at [entry = the ELF's entry of f] ([kexec_ok_exec]) and the
           kernel returns THE CALLER'S WP, applied as far as it can:
           [S (exec_key U' sts na)] -- the slot at the state the
           process resumes in (the new trapframe with [a0 := argc], the
           new image, the new size, the caller's descriptor view), still
           owed the payload kexec never held -- beside the pure
           [kexec_image_ok] it was instantiated at.  The receipt was
           consumed by the WP premise.
       (b) [a] is anything else and kexec succeeded anyway: a file the
           code accepts that [kexec_loadable] does not describe (see THE
           ACCEPTANCE PREDICATE), or NOT A FILE AT ALL -- kexec never
           tests the inode's type, it reads raw bytes off whatever the
           path names, so a directory whose dirent bytes begin with the
           ELF magic is exec'd (a finding of the phase-A proof,
           2026-09-04).  The landed success conjuncts hold at SOME entry,
           and the kernel returns THE CALLER'S WP again -- the SECOND wand
           of [exec_slot_pre], applied at [exec_key_ok], the part of those
           conjuncts that speaks about the resume key.  The receipt is
           consumed by that wand, and the kernel mints nothing.
   - ret = -1 (FAILURE): the landed failure arm ([V' = V]) beside the
     honest three-way fold of the bundle: (i) nothing fs-visible fired
     (begin_op/namei not reached: unspent bundle back); (ii) the walk died
     at hop [k] (the era refund shape, commit and WP back); (iii) the walk
     completed, the node was OBSERVED (the receipt is delivered), and
     exec failed past the lock -- a bad ELF, a directory or device, an
     allocation failure, an oversized argument set -- with the WP premise
     back.  A failed exec's abstract effect is NIL: kexec mutates no
     inode, so there is no delta anywhere in this contract.

   ==== THE ONE OBSERVATION (why not a fupd per readi) ==================

   kexec reads the file 1 + phnum + Σ ceil(filesz/PGSIZE) times (the
   header, each program header, each page of each segment -- the three
   static readi sites in ProofKexecACode/B3/B2), and EVERY one of those reads
   happens under the ONE [ilock] kexec takes before the header read and
   releases at [iunlockput].  Under the lock the node cannot move (the
   payload's custody pins the authority's row, exactly as
   [SysOpenDefs]'s trunc receipt argues), so every readi returns bytes
   of the SAME [f]: the reads are deterministic functions of one observed
   value, and a per-read commit family would deliver [n] receipts of the
   same [f] at the same instant.  The linearization point of exec's READ
   side is the lock, and the contract says so with one commit.  A caller
   that wants per-read receipts derives them from [f] ([rd_bytes] is
   [file_byte] of the payload, and [FsStateInode.fn_file_bytes] reads the
   same payload) -- the prover's obligation is the single fire at the
   header oracle hook ProofKexecACode already carries, generalized from
   "a header claim" to "the whole node".

   ==== THE ACCEPTANCE PREDICATE, HONESTLY ==============================

   [kexec_loadable f] is NOT the code's test.  The code checks the magic
   and, per PT_LOAD header, four arithmetic facts, and otherwise trusts
   an attacker-controlled table; a file with overlapping or descending
   segments can pass it, and its image is then NOT [ElfFile.elf_image]
   (later segments overwrite earlier ones; a descending one hits
   [loadseg]'s "address should exist" panic, which is why the ascending
   condition is in).  [kexec_loadable] is the set of files for which
   the LOADED IMAGE IS THE ELF SEMANTICS' IMAGE: [ElfFile.elf_wf] (the
   file-side well-formedness the dumps satisfy) plus the xv6-loadable
   bounds elf.md names (the two 4-byte [int] truncations kexec performs,
   page-aligned segment starts, ascending non-overlapping segments).
   Success arm (b) is the honest residue: the code CAN succeed on a file
   outside the set, and this contract then promises nothing about the
   image -- only [exec_key_ok], and the caller pays for that case out of
   its own deposit's second wand.  Tightening the set toward the
   code's test is the prover's finding to report, never a premise to
   strengthen here.

   ==== THE IMAGE, AND WHAT IS DEFERRED ================================

   [kexec_image_ok f na alen afun sts W'] states what kexec built, at the
   key the slot is stated on ([UexecSlot.uvis]):
     - the resume pc is the ELF entry (word [tf_epc_idx] of the
       trapframe; [tf_resume_pc] clears bit 0 and every entry is even);
     - the size is [kexec_sz f]: the segments' end rounded up plus the
       guard and stack pages;
     - sp and a1 are [kxc_sp_final], a0 is argc (the landed [kxc_tf]
       rows, plus the a0 the dispatcher writes on return);
     - the ELF's file image and its .bss zeros are IN the image
       ([UmodeAbi.uimg_sub (elf_image f)]);
     - THE STACK kexec allocates ON TOP of the image ([kexec_stack_at]):
       two pages above the rounded-up segment end, the lower one the
       guard [uvmclear] makes inaccessible, the upper one the initial
       stack; the arguments are pushed from its top -- argument [i]'s
       characters and NUL at [kxc_sp top alen (S i)], then the
       [na + 1]-word [ustack] vector at [kxc_sp_final], [ustack[i]] the
       address of string [i] and [ustack[na] = 0], every word
       little-endian ([kexec_args_at]); every other byte of the stack
       page reads ZERO (uvmalloc's zero fill, in the lazy view); [sp]
       and [a1] are the vector's address and [a0] is [argc] -- so
       main's [argv] is exactly that vector, which is what a slot
       constructor reads off the key through [kexec_image_ok_argv];
     - THE PERMISSIONS ([KexecBuilt.kxb_perm_ok] at [uvis_perm W']):
       every page [uvmalloc] mapped for a PT_LOAD header carries that
       header's X/W bits ([flags2perm]: X iff [flags & 1], W iff
       [flags & 2] -- the pages from the previous segment's rounded end
       up to [vaddr + memsz]), the stack page is W and not X, and the
       guard page, mapped with U cleared, is ABSENT from the projection.
       This is the code/data split the U-tier keys on: under the
       non-coherent instruction cache the only pages a program may run
       are those executable AND not writable, and a slot constructor
       reads exactly that off this row for the text segment;
     - AND NOTHING ABOVE THE BREAK ([KexecBuilt.kxb_perm_below] at
       [uvis_sz W'] / [uvis_perm W']): the converse of the row above.
       exec builds a FRESH table -- uvmcreate, uvmalloc up to the loads'
       top, the guard and the stack page -- so the kernel's own
       [ProcPtOwn.um_below] holds of it, and this is that fact read at
       the key.  It is what a slot constructor needs for the exec'd
       program's later [sbrk] to see the run it is handed as fresh
       ([UserHeap.uheap]'s map-stop clause);
     - the descriptor view is the caller's ([sts]) and the trapframe is
       [TFWORDS] long.
   NOT YET STATED, named so the follow-on is a list: (d2) the zero fill
   of the .bss-to-page-end tail and of the guard page's reading; (d3)
   [p->name].  Each is a pure conjunct on [W'], added without moving any
   shape.

   ==== LOADABLE MEANS SUCCESS, MODULO MEMORY ===========================

   The failure arm past the lock (arm (iii)) names its CAUSE
   ([exec_fail_cause]): the node was not a loadable file, or the
   arguments did not fit the stack page ([kxc_stack_ok] false), or an
   allocation failed (a kalloc / uvmalloc / proc_pagetable exhaustion).
   The pool is uncounted, so memory exhaustion has no pure witness; what
   keeps [EfNoMem] from being a blanket excuse is ORDER: every allocation
   kexec performs comes after the ELF magic test, so a memory failure
   implies the node's bytes -- if it was a file -- passed THE KERNEL'S
   test ([kexec_magic_ok]: a header's worth of bytes whose first four
   are the magic; the code compares only those four, not the class and
   data bytes [ElfFile.elf_magic_ok] also checks) -- [exec_fail_ok]'s
   [EfNoMem] row.  A real file that failed that test, or was too short
   to hold a header, must be blamed on [EfNotLoadable], and the tails
   have the header buffer to prove it.
   So a caller that proves [kexec_loadable f] and the fit condition for
   its arguments learns that the only way exec fails after resolving
   its path is running out of memory -- and that on success it holds
   its own WP at the image it computed.  A caller that proves nothing
   about the file answers arm (b)'s wand with the generic user-mode
   safety WP, which does not care what the image holds.

   ==== WHERE THE PROOF PAYS EACH PIECE ================================

   1. THE WALK: [SpecNameiEra.wp_namei_era] at [ex_start]'s one-shot,
      fired at phase A's namei site ([ProofKexecA]).
   2. THE OBSERVATION: [FsAbsOpenFire.opf_open_fire] (the whole-[anode]
      fire off the lock window's [top_frag]) at the header-oracle hook of
      phase A, delivering [Fo]'s receipt.
   3. THE BYTES: each readi's [rd_bytes data off] IS a window of the
      observed [f] ([era_node]'s [fn_file_bytes] = [file_byte data] over
      the size), so the header the commit block reads, the program
      headers the loop reads and the segments loadseg copies are
      [f]'s -- one bridge lemma per readi site.
   4. THE IMAGE: [kexec_image_ok] out of [KexecBuilt]'s cone facts:
      [kxc_tf] for the trapframe words, the uvmalloc/loadseg loop for
      [uimg_sub (elf_image f)], copyout's post for [kexec_args_at]; the
      composition is [KexecBridge.exec_built_Q].
   5. THE HAND-OFF: [exec_slot_pre] instantiated at the observed [f] and
      the built key, returning the [S]-slot on arm (a) and refunding the
      premise on every other arm.  The proofs never open [S].
   6. THE DISPATCH SIDE: the exec channel carries the returned slot to
      the deposit instead of minting, and the U-mode side's [uexec_ret]
      exec arm SUPPLIES [exec_au_pre] ([UexecSG]'s deposit class,
      instantiated in [UexecExecInst]) -- the seam through which a
      verified program hands over its successor's WP.

   BINDERS: KexecDefs's list plus [ufdG] (the slot's section binds it,
   and the dispatcher instantiates [S] there).  [GenId] because the arms
   carry [proc_priv]. *)

  (*  2a.  The program's WP, conditional on what was observed             *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* THE CALLER'S WP (header, IN 3): handed its own receipt for the node
     kexec read, the caller supplies the slot at the key kexec built.  TWO
     WANDS, ONE PER SUCCESS ARM, because the caller pays BOTH: the file is
     loadable and the key is the image's, or the node is not a loadable
     file and the key is only what the success conjuncts pin
     ([exec_key_ok]).  [Fo] is the observation receipt's shape
     ([aopen_commit_at]'s), so a caller pins the file it is willing to
     answer for through [Fo] -- init answers the first wand only for
     [f = sh_bytes], with sh's start WP, and REFUTES the second from the
     same pin (the node it observed IS its image's loadable file).  A
     process that pins nothing answers both from its generic family. *)
  (* THE CURSOR IS A PREMISE OF BOTH WANDS, and it is what ties the
     observed inum to the WALK: [Pfin] is the caller's cursor at the
     walk's LAST hop ([exec_au_pre] instantiates it at
     [P (length (path_elems pl))]), and the kernel applies both wands at
     the very inum the walk landed on -- [ProofKexecA.kxa_receipt] holds
     the receipt, the cursor and this piece at one [zi].  Without it the
     [i] the receipt names is an arbitrary inum and a pinned caller can
     neither identify the file arm (a) observed nor refute arm (b); the
     cursor is therefore SPENT here and no longer returned by
     [exec_post_ok]'s success arms. *)
  (* THE PAY FACT IS A PREMISE OF BOTH WANDS, and it is what lets the
     exec'd image's slot be built at all.  A slot is keyed by what its
     process's exit owes ([UkRun.ukn_pay], backed by [ChildTok.my_pay] of
     the process's generation), and exec KEEPS the generation -- the slot
     is not re-incarnated, only its image is ([KexecDefs.KexecOkQ]:
     [pv_gen V' = pv_gen V]) -- so the fact the exec'ing process handed in
     with its bundle is exactly the fact the NEW image's constructor needs,
     at the new key's own generation.  The kernel relays it: it holds it
     off the deposit ([UexecExecInst.exec_sbundle]) and applies both wands
     at the key it built, whose [uvis_gen] is the caller's own.
     [Q] IS THE PROCESS'S OWN NAMING of its payload, for the reason the
     exit deposit's is ([UexecRet.uexec_pay_dep]): a process may only ever
     name the payload it can prove is its own, and the generic family names
     the trivial one. *)
  (* AND NOTHING BESIDE THE FACT (lane SELF-KILL, P6).  The wands used to
     take the exec'ing process's payload at the kill status too, because
     the new image's run had to carry it between traps; no run carries one
     any more -- a KILL is paid for by the killer, into <p->lock>'s own
     killed row -- so the pay fact is all that crosses.  What the new image
     needs to pay its OWN exit travels the way sh's console lease does:
     through [PinnedExec]'s [Pay], as a resource of the program. *)
  (* THE TWO ROWS THE KERNEL PROVES AND THE PROGRAM READS (2026-09-12, the
     coordinator; lanes SH-OPEN and LAZY-FLAG).  Both wands resume a
     process, so both say what the key they resume at reads:

     - ITS WORKING DIRECTORY IS THE CALLER'S.  exec inherits the cwd
       ([exec_key_cwd] off [kexec_ok_exec_cwi]) and the FAILED arm resumes
       the caller itself, so [cw] -- the [cw] both bundle shapes are
       already stated at ([exec_au_pre], [SpecSysExec.sys_exec_au_pre]) --
       is the inum on either side.  [kexec_image_ok] cannot carry it: it is
       a fact about the CALLER's block, not about the file.  sh's entry
       needs it, because sh's pinned open of "console" is at ROOTINO.

     - AND ITS LAZY BIT IS [false] ([UexecSlot.uvis_lazy]).  The image exec
       loads is EAGER -- every segment's uvmalloc runs from the CURRENT
       size, so no gap is left, and the guard+stack pair closes the top --
       so the new space's projection has an empty fill, which is what a
       verified program's run is keyed at ([UexecRet.ukcq]).  On the failed
       arm it is the caller's own bit, and the caller is a verified program
       running at [false].  WHAT PAYS IT: lane LAZY-FLAG's K4 --
       [KexecBuilt.kexec_built] gains the fresh table's coverage row,
       [ProcInv.upd_exec] clears [ProcDefs.pv_lazy], and
       [KexecBridge.exec_image_ok_of_built] relays it. *)
  (* ...AND ITS CHILDREN SET AND ITS PID ARE THE CALLER'S (lane EXEC-SEAM).
     exec KEEPS the process -- it neither reaps nor re-numbers -- so the
     key both wands resume at reads the caller's children set [cs] and the
     caller's pid [pidv], the very binders the kexec contract already
     carries ([exec_key] puts them straight into the key, and both rows are
     [reflexivity] there: [exec_key_ch], [exec_key_pid]).  A pinned caller
     needs them because a freshly exec'd process's slot has to be able to
     say "I have no children yet" and "I am not <init>": sh's wait
     redeems the one child it forked against exactly those two facts. *)

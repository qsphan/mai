     QEMU keeps these separate and so must we, because xv6's safety depends
     on the difference:

       POP -- the device takes the next available-ring entry.  This is
       STRICTLY IN ORDER ([virtqueue_pop] increments [last_avail_idx] by
       one); [v_seen] is that index, and the positions the driver has
       published but the device has not popped are exactly the interval
       [[v_seen, avail_idx)].  In-order popping is what lets xv6 reuse the
       ring slot [idx % NUM]: the entry it overwrites belonged to a position
       the device is provably past.

       SERVICE -- the device works a popped request through [vphase] one bus
       transaction at a time, and finishes by pushing its used-ring element
       and bumping the used index.  This may happen in ANY order among the
       requests in flight (tools/vtest/README.md finding 5), which is what
       the two captures in vtest-rocq/DiskOrder.v show and what xv6's
       interrupt handler is written for.

     sector at a time in ANY order, at steps of the device's own choosing.

(* -- SECTOR GRANULARITY (claude-notes/completed/sector-atomic-disk.md) --

   A disk write is atomic at the SECTOR (512 bytes) and NOT at the 1024-byte
   BLOCK xv6 works in, so a crash can leave one sector of a block written and
   the other not.  The device therefore lands a request's data one sector per
   autonomous step (section 6), and the block-sized [disk_wr] a client
   deposits its permit at is CUT into per-sector writes here.

   [wr_sector w i] is sector [i] of [w]: the 512 bytes of [w]'s payload at
   payload offset [512*i], addressed at [w]'s own offset plus the same
   displacement.  [wr_sector None i = None] keeps a READ's permit free
   exactly as [wr_apply None] does.  The two facts the device layer runs on
   are [wr_sector_comm] (distinct sectors of one write commute, so the device
   may land them in ANY order) and [wr_fold_all] (landing every sector -- in
   any order, with repetitions allowed -- IS the whole write). *)

   ([virtio_write_step]'s fill), WRITES the status byte, WRITES the used-ring
   element (the same function, at the later phases), and finally WRITES the
   used index ([virtio_complete_step]).  Each is a separate memory event,
   so a hart -- and the memory model -- sees every intermediate state; the
   index bump, which is what the driver's completion test relies on, is
   ordered last by construction rather than by fiat. *)
(* THE USED ELEMENT'S [len] IS THE DEVICE-WRITABLE PART OF THE CHAIN: the
   status byte, plus the data buffer when the driver marked that descriptor
   WRITABLE.  So a disk READ reports 513 and a disk WRITE reports 1, which is
   what the hardware does; the model used to report the DATA descriptor's
   length in both directions (finding 4) -- 512 where the hardware says 1.
   Nothing in this tree noticed because xv6's driver ignores the field; a
   driver that used it to learn how much of a partial read arrived would have
   been verified against a device that does not exist.

   THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE DESCRIPTOR FLAG, NOT THE REQUEST TYPE, and that
   is the whole subtlety: an unrecognised type or a FLUSH published through a
   read-shaped chain has a writable data buffer that the device never fills,
   and the hardware still counts it (DiskErr.v measures exactly that).  The
   spec's "number of bytes WRITTEN" would say 1 there; every real device
   reports the writable segment's length instead, and a model that reported 1
   would produce a value the hardware does not -- which is the defect this
   finding was about, merely relocated. *)

  (* THE COUNTED SEAL, derived at the [log_op] existential's OWN WITNESS
     (fs-icache.md section 18; ProofBmap's wp_bmap_sconf, same shape).
     [log_op γ ncount] IS [∃ Sb, log_opS γ ncount Sb], so the counted form
     destructs it, runs the core at whatever set was hiding there, and
     forgets the grown set again via [log_opS_op].  Deriving at [Sb := ∅]
     instead would force every counted caller to prove its set empty, which
     is both false and unnecessary -- and here it would be pointless as well,
     since [wi_inv_enter] holds at ANY entry set. *)

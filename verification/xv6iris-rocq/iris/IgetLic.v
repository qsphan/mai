(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR.

    [SpecIget] hands back a REFERENCE to an inode the caller names only by
    its inum, and the number came off a disk block: nothing in iget's own
    contract says the inum is allocated, and nothing in iget's own proof
    could.  §20.17.5 answered that with a PARAGRAPH -- an enumeration of the
    six reasons a caller of iget has to believe its inum names a live
    record, checked by reading the tree.  This file makes the paragraph a
    TYPE.

    The user's invariant -- "the kernel will never invoke iget on inode
    numbers in directories in a disconnected subtree" -- is not statable as
    a property of the machine's traces anywhere inside [ProofCreate] or
    [ProofIput] (§20.17.7 option (ii)).  It IS statable as a resource
    premise at the point of DELIVERY, and that is what [iname] is: every
    [iget] in the tree presents one licence out of a closed list, and the
    orphan-[".."] door (TRACE G, §7.5.4) is closed by contract, at exactly
    the [fs.c:693] [nlink] guard where [ProofNamex] earns its own.

    AN INDEX, NOT AN EXISTENTIAL (§7.1.1).  [ilic] is an inductive with one
    constructor per licence and [iname] is a [match] on it.  Three things
    the index buys that a disjunction does not: [destruct l] is exhaustive
    by construction; every call site names its licence in its own [iApply]
    line, so the audit is a [grep]; and §20.17.5's box becomes a
    mechanically checkable proposition -- *no site in the tree instantiates
    [GreyL]* -- which under the paragraph was a claim about reachability.

    HOME.  This is a NEW LEAF and it stays one.  The definitions belong
    beside [InodeRegion.v]'s ledger, but that file carries ~350 dependents
    and an additive definition inside it costs that cone on every iteration
    (durable-notes, "the rebuild cone is the dev-loop cost") -- the same
    reason [IregLinkNz.v] exists.  Fold back at a milestone.

    WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT DO.  It does not discharge the free-side wall.
    §7.1.6's death certificate stands verbatim: the licence is BORROWED at
    the iget and RETURNED before the call ends, so [iput] holds none, and
    "the reference that outlives its licence" (§20.7) is untouched.
    The fresh-type span stands (see [ProofCreateFreshTy.v]).  This increment retires §20.17.5's PARAGRAPH,
    not §20.7's WALL.                                                      *)

(*  §20.4's six licences, in §20.4's order, plus R14's transitional seventh.

      [LinkedL]  (a)  a directory record names the inum and PAYS for it: the
                      caller lends the ENTRY's counting unit
                      ([FsStateLink.link_tok] at that inum, borrowed out of
                      the home's [FsStateInode.ent_toks] by
                      [FsStateEra.ent_toks_borrow]), the RA's own law
                      [link_auth_toks_le] read at the TARGET's authority in
                      [InodeRegion.ireg_lnk] bounds the count below, and
                      (L3) turns that into a nonzero type.  This is the
                      allocatedness witness §20 exists for, and it is the
                      licence every [dirlookup] delivers at a record that is
                      not the home's own.
                      THE CONSTRUCTOR CARRIES THE FRAGMENT'S VALUE and no
                      flavour index: a fragment is [{[ty]}] at the target's
                      key and there is no column to name.
      [HeldL]    (c)  the caller already holds the record, exclusively.  A
                      lookup of ["."] is the worked instance: it returns the
                      inum of the directory the caller has locked, whose own
                      [dinode_at] with a nonzero type is a strictly BETTER
                      witness than any fragment.
      [ClaimL]   (d)  the detached fragment of a claim box.  NOTHING MINTS
                      AN [iclaim] TODAY and nothing may: §7.1.5's theorem
                      says any region clause strong enough to found (d) is a
                      clause [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] must re-establish, so (d) and
                      the walled increment F1.5c/F1.5d are ONE increment.
                      The constructor is R11's honesty marker, kept visible
                      in the source and never instantiated.
      [BufL]     (e)  the caller holds the inode BLOCK's client half at
                      bytes that decode to a record with a nonzero type.
                      §7.1.3's improvement on §20.4: the resource is
                      [FsBlocks.fs_chalf], one level below [bio_locked], and
                      it is STRONGER -- the element sits at ½+½, so a client
                      holding one half means no [ireg_write_au] /
                      [ireg_claim_au] / [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] at ANY inum of that
                      block can fire while it is held.  That is §16.2's
                      serialiser as a resource fact.
      [RootL]    (f)  the inum is the root's.  The region's ROOT KEEP-ALIVE
                      TOKEN ([InodeRegion.ireg_keep], read by
                      [ireg_lnk_root_alive]) is what makes this a licence
                      rather than an assumption: root's [".."] is a SELF
                      record and therefore tokenless, so root's [nlink = 1]
                      is unaccounted for and the region parks the one unit
                      that nothing spends.                              *)

(*  THREE CONSTRUCTORS CARRY DATA, AND THAT IS FORCED BY "THE SAME [l]".
    §7.1.1 wrote (a), (c) and (e) with the licence's content hidden behind a
    [∃] -- [∃ d, dinode_at …], [∃ ds, fs_chalf …].  A post that returns the
    licence "at the same [l]" then returns a DIFFERENT resource: the caller
    lends [dinode_at γi inum dn] and gets back [∃ d, dinode_at γi inum d],
    which no walk can put back into its payload.  The borrow is only a
    borrow if the index pins the content, so the record, the record LIST and
    the payment FLAVOUR are constructor arguments.  The enumeration is
    closed and [destruct l] is exhaustive. *)
Inductive ilic :=
  (* (a) CARRIES THE FRAGMENT'S VALUE: the type register's
     fragment is [{[ty]}] at the target's key, and the licence is BORROWED
     -- the walk that lends it out of its directory's [ent_toks] has to put
     the SAME unit back, so the value cannot be hidden behind an
     existential here. *)

  (*  LICENCE (a) IS ONE PROPOSITION: [FsStateLink.link_tok Γ z], the
      type register's unit at the TARGET inum.  There is no flavour to
      index, so the lending is not "the payload's ticket at record k" but
      "one of the home's entry units", peeled by
      [FsStateEra.ent_toks_borrow] and put back by its wand.

      WHY THE BORROW IS NOT HERE.  [ent_toks] is keyed by NAME, so the peel
      needs [FsTree.dir_view_lookup] at the record the scan WON on; that is
      an era-side fact and it lives beside the other per-move lemmas in
      [FsStateEra].  What is left here is the licence itself.

      WHY NO COLUMN BOUND IS READ HERE EITHER.  The bound the licence needs is
      [1 <= #tokens ⟹ 1 <= nlink], and the RA proves it OUTRIGHT
      ([FsStateLink.link_auth_toks_le]) against the authority the region
      parks at the target's own slot ([InodeRegion.ireg_lnk]).  So the
      reading below opens [iregN] once and applies
      [InodeRegion.ireg_lnk_tok_nz]; there is nothing else to consult and
      no invariant to maintain. *)

       licence -- it is simply part of the [iname] resource the caller
       lends, and [ProofIreclaim.v:1302] (the only site in the tree) is a

       ABOUT THIS CONSTRUCTOR and nothing else: the half a [BufL] presenter
       holds must be the block that CONTAINS the inum it is licensing, or
       [iname_mint_ok] cannot meet it against the region's own half.  Stated

       region's exclusive byte run), and that crossing is sound only once
       recovery has emptied the exception set.  Carrying the certificate IN
       THE LICENCE is what keeps it off [SpecIget]'s contract -- boot's
       [userinit] runs its [namei("/")] iget BEFORE [initlog], with no seal
       in existence, and it presents a different constructor.  The one
       presenter in the tree ([ProofIreclaim]'s boot walk) runs inside

  (*  THE LICENCE TABLE AT AN IN-TRANSITION BOX                           *)
  (*  (iclaim-ledger.md §2.6, executed as §3.1's RULING A)                 *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (*  WHAT THIS IS.  §2.6 wrote a five-row table -- "at a box the free path
      has frozen, EVERY runtime licence is refutable" -- and increment IIIb
      proved it unimplementable against the count-only pin: four of the five
      rows contradict a frozen box through its LINK COUNT, and the pin did
      not mention one.  RULING A put [di_nlink d = 0 /\ di_type d <> 0] back
      into [InodeRegion.ireg_frz_ok] at both phases, and this lemma is the
      table.

      WHY IT IS NOT AN ACCESSOR, unlike every other reading in this file.
      Its two consumers -- [IcacheInv]'s up-count movers and
      [IcacheEscrow]'s pool peel -- call it with [^iregN] ALREADY OPEN (the
      count coupling's region half is what they came for), and an invariant
      cannot be opened twice.  So the lemma takes the SLOT's own components
      as arguments, in the order [InodeRegion.ireg_slot] hands them out, and
      concludes about the f column that came with them.  The standing
      constraint (§7.1.4) is met a different way: every fact is about the
      record [d] the authority itself is carrying, tied to the caller by
      [Hmd], so nothing here says anything about a record nobody named.

      EVERYTHING IS BORROWED.  The conclusion is PURE, so the proofmode
      shares the arguments rather than consuming them and the caller's slot
      pieces are all still in hand afterwards.

      THE FIVE ROWS.

        [LinkedL]     one counting unit bounds the target's OWN authority
                      below ([InodeRegion.ireg_lnk_tok_nz], the RA's law),
                      hence [1 <= di_nlink d]; the pin says a frozen
                      record's is zero.  This is the row the whole table
                      exists for -- it is what a [dirlookup]-licenced iget
                      presents.
        [HeldL d']    the licence IS a [dinode_at], so ghost-map agreement
                      pins [d' = d], and §2.6's strengthening of the arm
                      carries [di_nlink d' <> 0] into the same collision.
        [ClaimL]      the c column, not the record: [link_claim_agree] reads
                      [c = Some] off the token and [ireg_claim_ok]'s new
                      conjunct (RULING A) says a claimed box's f column is
                      [FrzOff].  It has to go this way round -- a claim box
                      has [di_nlink = 0] too ([fresh_shape]), so the record
                      cannot tell the two generations apart, which is
                      exactly the B1/B2 debt §0 names.
        [BufL bno ds] not the record and not the count but the BOOT
                      one-shot: the licence lends [ireg_boot], and the
                      freeze's own boot-shelter disjunct is then refuted arm
                      by arm ([ity_pending_excl] against a parked pending,
                      [ireg_boot_open_excl] against a runtime seal), leaving
                      its LEFT disjunct.  This is the one row that was
                      already provable under the count-only pin (IIIb's
                      finding), and it is unchanged.
        [RootL]       the region's own keep-alive token delivers
                      [1 <= di_nlink d] outright and the collision is the
                      first row's.                                        *)

  (* ===================================================================== *)
  (*  THE MINT's TABLE (iclaim-ledger.md §5', RULING R)                     *)
  (* ===================================================================== *)

  (*  [iname_not_claimed] AND ITS ALLOCATEDNESS TWIN, FUSED.  §5'.2 asks for
      "[iname_not_claimed] -- the §2.6-pattern table lemma, twin of the landed
      [iname_not_frozen]"; the mint needs TWO facts from the same five rows
      and by the same three bridges, so they are ONE lemma:

        (i)  the box is ALLOCATED -- [di_type <> 0] -- which is what
             [InodeRegion.ireg_ref_ok]'s (R2) owes at every up-count;
        (ii) a NON-[ClaimL] licence's box is UNCLAIMED -- [c = None] -- which
             is (R3), THE PIN: "no plainly-licenced reference exists to a
             claim box".

      THE THREE BRIDGES, and two of them are [iname_not_frozen]'s verbatim.
      (a) a NAMED record has [di_nlink <> 0], which gives (i) by (L3)'s
      contrapositive and (ii) because a claim box is [fresh_shape] and its
      count is ZERO; (b) the ledger's sum bounds that count from below, which
      is rows [LinkedL] and [RootL]; (c) [HeldL] carries the count outright.
      The two rows that do NOT go through the count are the same two as in the
      freeze table: [ClaimL] reads the c column itself (and owes only (i),
      through the claim pin's [fresh_shape]), and [BufL] reads the BOOT
      one-shot against the c column's own shelter clause -- [ireg_boot] versus
      [ireg_open], [ireg_boot_open_excl], exactly as it plays the freeze's.

      WHY [BufL] TAKES THE BLOCK.  Its (i) is the buffer's own decoded type
      fact, and transporting it to the REGION's record needs the two block
      halves to meet -- which is [iname_buf_alloc]'s [ireg_read] step, except
      that this lemma's consumers ([IcacheInv]'s up-count movers) already hold
      [^iregN] open and cannot re-open it.  So the region's half comes IN as
      an argument, and the constructor's [bno] tie comes out of the LICENCE
      itself (SIMP-1).  Everything is borrowed: the conclusion is pure. *)
  (* THE BufL ROW'S BLOCK TRANSPORT, ON ITS OWN (durable-disk 1c-flip
     step 3).  [iname_mint_ok] below used to meet the licence's machinery
     half against the region's parked CACHE half by an auth-free
     agreement; the region now owns the block's EXCLUSIVE byte run, so the
     two maps meet only inside [FsBlocks.fs_bytes_inv].  That is a fupd,
     and [iname_mint_ok]'s conclusion is pure -- so the crossing is split
     off here and [iname_mint_ok] takes its result as a PURE premise, which
     keeps the five-row table an entailment and its one consumer's
     [iDestruct ... as %] shape.  Only the [BufL] row does any work. *)

  (* THE TABLE AS AN ACCESSOR, for the consumer that does NOT already have
     the region open: [IcacheEscrow.ipool_shape_to_np]'s AWAIT arm
     (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, A-refuter).

     WHAT IT REPLACES.  Increment IIIa spelled §1.3's refutation as a bare
     wand [ipool_await_refuter z = ifreeze_post z -* False], and IIIb proved
     that shape unbuildable: opening [ireg_inv] is a fupd, and
     [(|={E}=> False)] does not entail [False], so no amount of region
     reasoning can produce a wand into [False].  The ruling was to change
     the SHAPE of the premise, not its discharge -- so the refutation
     becomes a FUPD, the caller lends its licence, and the region opens
     INSIDE.

     WHAT IT SAYS.  A licence-holder's inum is not mid-transition, so any
     freeze token standing at it is the UNFROZEN one.  The await arm holds
     [ifreeze_post], and [FrzPost <> FrzOff] closes the arm outright.
     Everything is borrowed: the licence and the token both come back. *)

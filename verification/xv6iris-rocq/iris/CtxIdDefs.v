   record): the BOUND authority (one monotone nat -- clean facts'
   justification) and the DIRTY-SET authority (a ghost map keyed by

   what lets a token -- and hence every authority -- be minted wherever

(* The class TYPE is transparent to typeclass unification: [CurCtx] is
   definitionally [CtxId], and instance search must see through the
   wrapper's binder type or every [Persistent (is_lock … <{P}>)] /
   [CtxMorph <{P}>] resolution dies at the (CurCtx → iProp) vs
   (CtxId → iProp) seam.  This transparency is about the TYPE only; which
   ambient [CurCtx] INSTANCE a term picks up is unaffected (the
   silent-drop hazard in tso-port.md §2d concerns instance selection, not
   type unfolding). *)

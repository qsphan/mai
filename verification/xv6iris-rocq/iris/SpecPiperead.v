(* SpecPiperead.v -- the public interface of piperead, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int piperead(struct pipe *pi, uint64 addr, int n);

   piperead copies up to [n] bytes out of the pipe to user address [addr],
   sleeping on [&pi->nread] while the pipe is empty and the write end is
   still open, and returns the number it copied -- or -1 if the process was
   killed while it waited, or if the very first copyout failed.
   @ KernelSyms.piperead = 0x80004596, ~80 instructions, a 96-byte frame;
   ra/s0..s5 saved in the prologue, s6..s8 SHRINK-WRAPPED onto the paths
   that need them.

   THE MIRROR of SpecPipewrite.v -- read its header for the altitude story
   (the pipe at the reference tier, the process at the [proc_priv] tier,
   [pipe_rw_ret], and why noff is pinned at 0).  The one asymmetry worth
   noting: piperead can return 0 where pipewrite would sleep again -- a
   closed write end ends the wait -- and its -1-on-copyout-failure arm only
   fires when NOTHING was copied yet (i == 0); a partial success returns
   the partial count, exactly like pipewrite.  [pipe_rw_ret] covers both
   readings, and the spec deliberately does not distinguish them: which one
   happens is decided by concurrent writers.

(* piperead's own frame is 12 slots; the deepest callee is copyout at 52
   (14-slot frame / walkaddr 10 / walk 8 / vmfault 38 / memmove 2); sleep
   wants 22, wakeup 18, killed 14, myproc/acquire/release 10.

   12 + 52 = 64, YET THIS IS 62, AND THAT IS NOT A ROUNDING ERROR.  Unlike
   either_copyout's, piperead's copyout call does not sit on the bare frame:
   it is inside the trap reserve, so the budget the call site actually has is
   [trap_res true + (av - 12)] = [78 + (av - 12)], and 62 clears 52 with room
   to spare.  Raising this to 64 would over-charge every caller for slots the
   call site never needs.  (Consequence for the proof: the [52 <= ...] premise
   no longer falls to a bare [lia] -- [trap_res true] has to be reduced first,
   `assert (trap_res true = 90%nat) as -> by reflexivity; lia`.)  *)

   256 bytes, 98 instructions -- the largest function of the inode layer, and
   structurally the hardest: a loop with two breaks, three early exits, and
   five conditionally-saved registers.  Design:
   claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md, "writei -- the loop, and what a PARTIAL
   write may claim".

   ==== THE POSTCONDITION IS A FLAT BYTE-RANGE CLAIM ====================

   [inode_blocks fsc_fs bm data] is indexed by file BLOCK; writei is about a
   byte RANGE that straddles blocks.  Stating the effect per block would
   force every caller to redo the straddle arithmetic, so the view is
   defined once ([file_byte] below) and the whole effect is ONE clause:

     forall k, file_byte data' k = if off <= k < off + tot
                                   then <the byte written at k>
                                   else file_byte data k

   -- which covers a full write, a short write and a zero write uniformly.

   ==== ...PLUS A BOUNDED DISTURBED REGION ==============================

   The clause above is NOT the whole truth, and the reason is the fix to
   kernel defect D1 (claude-notes/kernel-defects.md).  When either_copyin
   fails part-way it has already copied a PREFIX of the chunk into the
   buffer, and writei now does

       log_write(bp);  brelse(bp);  break;

   -- i.e. it COMMITS the partial chunk rather than stranding it in the
   buffer cache.  That is the consistent thing to do (the alternative is a
   block whose contents depend on cache state), but it means the file
   genuinely changes OUTSIDE [off, off+tot): the return value [tot] is not
   advanced over the failed chunk, while the chunk's bytes are logged.

   So the postcondition admits a DISTURBED REGION immediately after the
   written range: [dist] bytes at [off+tot], with [dist <= BSIZE] because
   one chunk never crosses a block boundary, holding unspecified bytes
   [dstb].  Everything at or beyond [off+tot+dist] is unchanged, and
   [dist = 0] whenever no copy failed -- which a caller reads off
   [tot = n].  Both the bound and the [tot = n] tie are what make the
   clause usable: without them "the rest of the file is untouched" would be
   unavailable at every offset.

   ...AND THE REGION IS EMPTY ON THE KERNEL ARM (fs-icache.md §15.1(i)).
   The partially-copied chunk exists only because [either_copyin] can FAIL
   part-way, and it can only fail on the USER arm: [SpecEitherCopyin]'s
   post is [r = 0 \/ r = -1] when [user], but a bare [r = 0] when not --
   the kernel path is a [memmove] with no fault to take.  So the -1 break
   is DEAD for [user = false] and the third clause

     user = false -> dist = 0

   is provable rather than merely plausible.  It is what lets dirlink's
   middle-slot write claim EXACTNESS above the record (the up-to-64
   following records the three-way clause otherwise concedes), and hence
   what lets a writer re-park [DirView.dir_ok] after a dirlink -- create's
   obligation in the fs-sysfile campaign.  Stated as its own clause rather
   than by case-splitting the range clause: consumers on the user arm are
   untouched, and a kernel-arm consumer rewrites [dist] to 0 and reads the
   two-way clause off the same line.

   WHAT THE "BYTE WRITTEN" IS, AND WHY IT IS STILL AN EXISTENTIAL.  On the
   KERNEL arm the source bytes are the caller's own and the clause pins
   them to [src_bytes].  On the USER arm they are copied out of user
   memory -- and SINCE RULING A (2026-08-31, the content seam) the contract
   pins them there too, to the IMAGE the caller lent: [copyin_got (us_M U)
   src tot wrote], byte [i] of the run IS the process's byte at user va
   [src + i].  [wrote] stays existentially quantified because the two arms
   name it differently and because the DISTURBED region's bytes still have
   no name at all; what has gone is the silence about the written range.

   THE OLD STANCE, and why it moved: [SpecEitherCopyin] used to hand the
   destination back as a bare [exists dst_new] -- not because the kernel
   may assume nothing about user memory (it may assume exactly what the
   process's own image says) but because either_copyin's relay dropped the
   fact [SpecCopyin.wp_copyin_sconf_mem] had been proving since the image
   campaign's tier 3.  writei holds [proc_priv_core], hence the image, so
   the fact is now stateable here; the seam is one output conjunct at each
   storey and no premise anywhere moves.

   HOLES READ AS ZEROS ([InodeInv.blk_holes_zero]).  [inode_blocks] leaves
   [data i] unconstrained at an UNALLOCATED index [i], and bmap deposits a
   freshly allocated block into the bundle at [replicate BSIZE 0] -- so
   without a normalisation of the unallocated indices the clause above is
   false the moment writei extends the file.  [blk_holes_zero] is that
   normalisation, threaded in and back out; it is also the xv6 file semantics
   (a hole reads as zeros).  It lives next to [inode_blocks] in InodeInv.v,
   as does the flat view [file_byte] the clause above is stated on.

   ==== COVERAGE IS PRESERVED ===========================================

   [InodeInv.bm_covers bm sz] -- every file block whose first byte is below
   [sz] is allocated -- is what keeps readi out of the log entirely
   (SpecReadi.v's header).  writei EXTENDS the file, so a caller that writes
   and then reads could never re-establish it unless writei promised it: the
   predicate is therefore a PREMISE at the old size and a POSTCONDITION at
   the new one.

   It is provable rather than merely desirable because writei allocates every
   block it writes -- through bmap, BEFORE [tot] is advanced over the chunk --
   and installs [size' = max(size, off + tot)].  So a block below the new size
   is either below the OLD size (the premise, carried across each bmap call by
   [InodeInv.bm_covers_keep], whose hypothesis is exactly the "never
   un-allocates" clause SpecBmap already carries) or was allocated by the loop
   itself, which is the loop invariant [bm_covers bmI (off + tot)].  Neither
   break arm needs a special case: both stop [tot] early, and the DISTURBED
   REGION below lies at or above [off + tot], hence at or above the new size,
   where coverage claims nothing.

   ==== ...AND THE TWO CONJUNCTS A RE-PARKER NEEDS ======================

   [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] carries [InodeLock.inode_ok fsc_cov fsc_logst dn' bm'
   data'], whose SEVEN conjuncts a caller that re-parks the inode after the
   write has to rebuild.  Five of them are the clauses above (blkmap_wf,
   bm_covers, di_addrs, [di_type] -- which [wi_dinode] keeps definitionally
   -- and blk_holes_zero).  The remaining two are the SIZE CAP
   [di_size dn' <= MAXFILE*BSIZE] (the [< 2^31] clause above is weaker) and
   [InodeInv.inode_sized data'].  fileread re-parks the IDENTICAL record and
   so never needed them; dirlink forwards rather than re-parks; filewrite is
   the first caller to re-park a CHANGED payload, which is why they appear
   only now.

   BOTH ARE STATED AS PRESERVATIONS, not as facts, and they have to be.
   Neither is provable outright:

   - the size cap, because [wi_dinode] installs [max(di_size dn, off+tot)]
     and the guard at +0x2a bounds only [off+n]; nothing in writei's
     premises bounds the caller's OWN [di_size dn] below MAXFILE*BSIZE (the
     premise is [< 2^31]), and on the -1 arm [dn' = dn] outright;
   - [inode_sized], because writei touches only the blocks its range
     straddles.  Every other index keeps [data i], whose length no resource
     in the cone constrains ([FsBlocks.fs_chalf] is a bare ghost_map half --
     InodeInv.v 503-506), and again on the -1 arm [data' = data].

   So both would have to be PREMISES, at which point they would ripple into
   SpecDirlink and every caller below it.  Stating the implication instead
   costs a re-parking caller nothing -- it holds both antecedents already,
   out of the very [inode_ok] it is going to rebuild -- and costs a caller
   that does not re-park (dirlink) exactly nothing at all: no premise moves,
   and the two clauses are dropped at its boundary.

   ==== A SHORT WRITE IS A NORMAL RETURN ================================

   The two breaks -- bmap returning 0 (out of blocks) and either_copyin
   returning -1 (bad user pointer) -- leave [tot < n] and RETURN [tot].
   Only the three up-front checks return -1.  A contract promising
   [tot = n] would be unprovable and one treating a short write as failure
   would be useless to filewrite, which loops on exactly this.

   The -1 arm additionally reports WHY (off past the end, or the range past
   MAXFILE*BSIZE), so a caller that has checked those knows it will not be
   taken.  AND THE WRITING ARM REPORTS THE EOF GUARD IT PASSED --
   [off <= ip->size] on the PRE-write record.  The two arms are the two
   readings of ONE test -- the [c.lw a5,76(a0)] at +0x00 and the [bltu
   a5,a3] at +0x02 -- and stating it only on the -1 side left the contract
   PERMITTING a success past the end of the file, which the code cannot
   produce: an abstract caller that reads the effect of the write as a
   SPLICE at [off] then has a range clause whose [file_byte data k] tail is
   junk it never owned, and its delta is WRONG rather than merely
   unprovable.  (FILEWRITE-AU is that caller; the guard is what its commit
   is keyed on.)  It costs no proof: every path that reaches the writing
   arm is past that branch, so the fall-through fact is already in hand and
   only travels down the block chain to the arm.
   The overflow test at +0x02e is DEAD BY THE JOINT NUMERIC PREMISE
   [off + n < 2^31] below -- NOT by two separate bounds on [off] and [n],
   which would let the [addw] at +0x022 wrap.  See that premise's comment,
   including the coverage note it carries.

   ==== SIZE AND FLUSH ==================================================

   [ip->size] is raised to the ADVANCED [off] when the write went past the
   old end, and [iupdate] then runs UNCONDITIONALLY on every returning path
   -- including [n = 0].  So writei needs everything iupdate needs
   ([i_inum], [inode_meta], the [sb + 24] field, and -- since C2 -- the
   inode REGION's [ireg_inv] plus this inum's own [dinode_at] fragment
   instead of the block's [fs_chalf] half) on top of everything bmap needs.

   THE REGION'S RECORD IS NOT [dn].  [dn0] is what the region currently
   holds for this inum, which is STALE by construction (that is what the
   flush is for), and the postcondition names the record the call leaves
   there: [dn'] on the writing arm, [dn0] untouched on the -1 arm, which
   returns before iupdate is reached.  That existential replaces the old
   [ds'] one exactly.

   [di_addrs dn'] is set to [bm_cells bm']: [inode_meta] owns only the five
   scalar cells, so that field is a phantom index that may be
   re-instantiated freely, and choosing the FINAL map is what lets a caller
   call iupdate again (design doc, decision record).

   ==== THE GHOST user FLAG IS THREADED, NOT SPECIALISED =================

   [either_copyin] carries [user] as a ghost boolean with [proc_priv]
   required only on the user arm and the tighter length bound on the kernel
   arm; claude-notes/completed/either-copy.md says readi/writei are exactly
   why.  writei threads it: the precondition and the postcondition are
   [if user then ... else ...], and the descriptor comes back EXTENDED (the
   copy may fault pages in) on the user arm.

   ==== THE BUDGET IS SPEND-AT-MOST, WITH AN ITERATION BOUND =============

   The iteration count is bounded by the number of blocks the range
   straddles ([wi_blocks]), because every iteration but the last fills its
   block to the boundary.  So the premise is the lower bound
   [wi_cost_bmonly off n <= ncount] and the postcondition is spend-at-most
   -- writei BRANCHES, and [log_op] has no mover outside the log spinlock,
   so a path that skips a spend cannot burn the surplus (SpecBmap.v's
   header).

   THE COST IS TWO PER BLOCK, NOT SIX, AND THAT IS WHAT MAKES filewrite
   PROVABLE.  The naive per-iteration sum -- bmap's worst case 5 plus
   writei's own log_write -- gives [wi_cost], and [wi_cost 1023 FW_MAX = 25]
   against a MAXOPBLOCKS of 10: filewrite's own four-block chunk would be
   unpayable and the KERNEL would be at fault rather than the proof.  It is
   not: the 6 double-counts, because within ONE transaction the same block
   is logged once however many times it is written.  Under link 2's
   set-form bmap contract the honest figure is [wi_cost_bmonly = 2B + 2],
   which at B = 4 is EXACTLY 10.  See [WriteiBudget] sections 9-10 and
   fs-icache.md section 18.

   WHICH ABSORPTIONS ARE MODELLED, and which are merely true.  Two: the
   bitmap block (there is exactly one per file system, so every balloc of a
   transaction logs the SAME block and only the first pays --
   [WriteiBudget.one_bitmap_block]), and a freshly allocated data block
   (balloc's [bzero] already logged it, so writei's own [log_write] of it is
   free).  A third -- the indirect block, across ITERATIONS -- is true and
   deliberately NOT modelled: it would buy the three slots between 10 and
   [WriteiBudget.wi_cost_tight = 7], and the machinery is proven and parked
   in [WriteiBudget]'s [LogAmort] section for the day a kernel change needs
   them.  Today's accounting fits with ZERO slack
   ([WriteiBudget.wi_cost_bmonly_no_slack]).

   ==== ...AND THE CONTRACT COMES IN TWO FORMS ==========================

   [wp_writei_sconf] is the COUNTED form above.  [wp_writei_gen] below is
   the SET form of fs-icache.md section 18 clause 1: it takes
   [LogInv.log_opS γ ncount Sb] and returns [log_opS γ n' Sb'] with
   [Sb ⊆ Sb'], so a caller running writei inside a transaction it also uses
   for other calls can thread ONE set.  The counted form is DERIVED from it
   -- [log_op] IS [∃ Sb, log_opS] -- at whatever set the existential was
   hiding, exactly wp_bmap_sconf's pattern, so no existing caller moves.

   writei TAKES NO CREDIT PARAMETER, unlike bmap and log_write.  It does not
   need one: its loop invariant carries the unpaid bitmap block as one unit
   of held-back POTENTIAL ([WriteiBudget.bm_pot]) rather than as a case
   split, and [WriteiBudget.wi_inv_enter] establishes the invariant at ANY
   entry set.  A caller that has already logged the bitmap simply gets a
   call that spends one less than its budget allowed.

   NO CEILING ON [Sb' ∖ Sb] IS OFFERED.  Section 18 clause 1 asks for one
   and bmap supplies it, but S3l's finding is that no obligation anywhere
   consumes a ceiling -- callers only ever claim MEMBERSHIPS -- and here it
   would have to name every data block the loop touched, i.e. a set-valued
   function of the loop-carried [blkmap].  That is exactly the shape S3l
   recommended against letting the decorative clause force.  Budget
   soundness is carried by the counter alone: [log_spend_step] already
   refuses to grow [Sb] without spending a unit.

(* ...AND THE SPEND HALF AGAIN, WITHOUT THE [0 < tot] GUARD.  The same
   expression bounds the spend at EVERY [tot], because each way out of the
   loop leaves the ledger at a SUB-figure of it:

     - the up-front [-1] return spends nothing at all ([n' = ncount]);
     - the bmap-out-of-blocks break never reached writei's own
       [log_write], so the data-block term is UNSPENT (and on that arm
       [bmap_alloced] can only be the INDIRECT allocation, which
       [bmap_cost] already prices);
     - the part-way [either_copyin] break runs [log_write(bp)] BEFORE it
       leaves (fs.c's "might have partially updated the block"), which is
       exactly what the data-block term pays for.

   Only the MEMBERSHIP trio of [wi16_post] genuinely needs [0 < tot]:
   nothing enters [Sb'] on the -1 route, so no membership is available
   there at all.  A caller that must price a FAILING single-block write --
   create's [fail:] entries, through dirlink's append -- has no other
   source for the credit-aware figure: the coarse [wi_cost_bmonly] clause
   is four, and the interior mkdir entries reach their dirlink with six in
   hand against an [iput_units] of three.  Neither [tot] nor [Sb'] appears
   below, which is what makes this clause the SAME fact on every arm. *)

(* ByteBuf.v -- the byte-buffer algebra the copy loops run on.

   A "buffer" here is exactly the shape memmove's contract (SpecMemmove.v)
   consumes and produces:

       [∗ list] j ∈ seq 0 n, pa_add p j ↦ₘ f j

   -- [n] consecutive bytes from [p], with their values named by a function.
   copyin / copyout walk such a buffer one page-chunk at a time, so they need
   three things this file provides, all of them independent of what is being
   copied:

     SPLIT / JOIN a buffer into PREFIX / CHUNK / SUFFIX ([bb_split3],
       [bb_join3]), so the chunk can be handed to memmove re-anchored at its
       own base and put back afterwards.  The THREE-way form is the primary
       one and the one a copy loop should call: the two-way [bb_split] leaves
       the caller to unify [f (k + j)] against a metavariable [?f j], which is
       higher-order and fragile at a SYMBOLIC offset, whereas [bb_split3]
       spells all three windows and their naming functions explicitly.  The
       total length is a PREMISE ([a + b + c = L]) rather than the literal
       shape of the goal, so no [rewrite]-the-index dance is needed either.
       [bb_split]/[bb_join] remain as the two-way special cases ([c = 0]);
     NAME the bytes of an anonymous region ([bb_any_named]) -- kalloc's
       [page_own] and [ProcPtOwn]'s user pages are contents-EXISTENTIAL, and
       memmove wants a named source; and the converse ([bb_named_any]), used
       to give the page back;
     REBRAND the naming function ([bb_ext], [bb_join]), because the two halves
       of a buffer are named by two different functions and the caller's
       postcondition names the whole of it by one.

   A buffer is also read and written a WORD at a time -- a C struct laid over
   it ([struct logheader]'s [n] and [block[]]) is 4-byte fields, not bytes --
   so the same window vocabulary has a 32-bit twin: [bb_mk] (the word four
   consecutive named bytes spell), [bb_set] (the naming function a 4-byte
   store leaves behind), and [bb_word4_acc], which borrows the aligned cell
   at an offset out of a window and gives it back holding a new value.

   Nothing here mentions page tables, so it is reusable by copyinstr and by
   any future byte-range code. *)

     is the one whose [nth_byte]s ARE the window's bytes, and the rebuild
     proves that per byte anyway.  A caller that copied INTO the cell out of

  (* THE WINDOW FORGET: [TsoCtxShim.ctx_buf_to_mem]'s honest successor, and
     the ONLY direction of that pair that survives.  Named so that
     [grep ctx_buf_forget] is, like [grep ctx_pointsto_forget], the
     inventory of places where a byte run leaves the ledger. *)

Definition cold_s0 : mstate := MState init_regstate ∅ dev0_state.

(* THE COLD-BOOT STATE, computed once and TIED to the model by one lemma.
   [cold_state] is built by [vm_compute] rather than written down, and
   [cold_boot_exec] is what makes that legitimate: it says this state IS what
   [exec] gets from the model's chain.  Two reasons it has to be done this way
   and not by leaving [exec (ArchReset.boot_prog hid pma_boot) cold_s0] in every statement:
   - THE VM COSTS A SECOND, THE KERNEL COSTS GIGABYTES.  [vm_compute] runs the
     ~300-write chain in well under a second, but a plain [reflexivity] closes
     the goal with an [eq_refl] whose type the kernel then rechecks with its
     LAZY conversion -- and that measures >3.8 GB and climbing for ONE such
     equation (fifteen in a single [Qed] reached 25 GB before being killed).
     So the one expensive step is a [vm_cast_no_check], i.e. a cast the kernel
     rechecks with the VM as well, and everything downstream is a shallow
     conversion over the computed record.  Any future fact about model code run
     at a concrete state should be shaped the same way.
   - The same measurement is why [RiscvLang.reset_regs] keeps its literal values
     instead of being RESTATED as the chain's output: it sits inside [prim_step]
     and hence inside WP goals all over the tree, where any tactic that reduces
     the goal would meet the chain. The values live there; the proof lives here. *)
(* THE PRE-[init_model] STATE, computed once, and the model's own verdict on
   the configuration at it.  Both are [vm_cast_no_check]s for the reason the
   header gives: a plain [reflexivity] would leave the kernel's LAZY evaluator
   to redo the whole initializer chain. *)

   constants are the model's, and running [board_regs] after [sail_model_init]
   changes nothing.  Stated per register rather than as an equality of the two
   post-STATES on purpose: the redundant [register_set]s leave field FUNCTIONS
   that are pointwise equal but not convertible, so the state form would need
   funext AND a [register_beq] reflection lemma the generated model does not
   provide (its per-kind [beq]s are ~100-constructor enumerations, so
   [destruct]-based reflection is not affordable).  No other register is touched
   at all: [board_regs] is eight [register_set]s and nothing else. *)

Proof.
  (* [reflexivity] settles the six the simulator writes EXPLICITLY; mie and
     mideleg come from [init_regstate]'s [inhabitant], which is [zeros] rather
     than [mword_of_int 0] -- equal bitvectors whose [bv_is_wf] proof terms are
     not convertible, hence [bv_eq] (the durable-notes reflex). *)

(* MISA IS RUN-DERIVED NOW, and this lemma is what says so: [reset_misa] sets
   one bit per [hartSupports] answer, and with B and V disabled in
   model-xv6iris/sail-config-rv64d.json those answers produce exactly the
   platform constant the whole decode bridge is stated over.  Keep it: it is
   the tie between the config file and [MISA_C], so a config or model move
   that changes the answer breaks the build here rather than silently making
   [MISA_C] a fiction again. *)
Lemma cold_boot_misa (hid : mword 64) :

Proof. apply bv_eq; vm_compute; reflexivity. Qed.

(* THE PMP OBLIGATION IS COMPUTED, NOT PINNED.  [reset_regs] asks for
   [pmp_all_off] -- A = OFF and L = 0 in every entry, which is all the
   architecture's [reset_pmp] gives and all a boot consumer takes -- and at the
   CLOSED cold-boot run the register holds a concrete vector, so the predicate
   follows from the value the chain computed.  Two steps on purpose: the
   equality is the [vm_compute] (a [vec] is a list PAIRED WITH a length proof,
   and the two proofs are built by different lemmas -- the lists are equal and
   nat equality is decidable, so UIP closes it, no axiom), and the predicate
   then comes from [RiscvLang.pmp_all_off_pmpcfg_boot], which handles the
   out-of-range indices.
   THE OPEN-BASE VERSION IS A DIFFERENT PROOF and is NOT here: over an
   arbitrary power-on register file [reset_pmp] is a [foreach_ZM_up 0 63]
   per-entry read-modify-write, so [pmp_all_off] becomes a 64-way symbolic
   index resolution over a [vec_update_dec] tower plus two generic bitvector
   facts, none of it [vm_compute]-able.  That belongs to the ∀-garbage
   anchoring task (claude-notes/completed/crash.md, "PMPCFG PATCH
   RETIREMENT" / "NO PATCH CHAIN LEFT"). *)

(* NO PATCH LEFT: this is the model's own cold-boot register file, verbatim.
   The PMA table was the last [register_set] here, and [RiscvLang.pma_boot] is
   now the model's own three-region table (§3's [cold_boot_pma] is the tie), so
   every conjunct of [reset_regs] below is a value the chain COMPUTED.  The
   name is kept: it is what the boot cone asks for, and a future pin that the
   chain does not produce would go here. *)

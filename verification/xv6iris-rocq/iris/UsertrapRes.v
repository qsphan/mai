(* UsertrapRes.v -- [usertrap_res] DEFINED: the kernel-side bundle
   [SpecUsertrap.v] abstracts.  Definitional layer only -- Spec files and
   below, never a whole-function proof -- so the phases of ProofUsertrap can
   each open it without depending on one another.

   [SpecUsertrap.v]'s boundary is "machine state in, machine state out, plus
   [R pt ksp]".  This file says what R is.  It splits three ways:

     [ut_trap]  -- the TRAP-SIDE pieces: everything [IntrDefs.sie_cap] and
                   [IntrDefs.sconf] need that is not the mstatus cell the
                   boundary hands over raw, the per-cpu bundle, and the four
                   loose ghost fractions the excursion through user mode
                   parks (see below).  This is what Phase A assembles.
     [ut_env]   -- the UNION OF THE FIVE CONES' environments (syscall,
                   devintr, vmfault, printk-general, kexit), which usertrap
                   only ever hands over.  Most of it is [syscall_env]'s union
                   already -- kexit's list IS sys_exit's -- so the real
                   content is what syscall does not need: devintr's device
                   caps, vmfault's kalloc side, and printk-general's pr lock.
     [ut_res]   -- the two above, existentially closed over every ghost name
                   and over the process record, keyed on (pt, ksp) because
                   those are the only two the TRAMPOLINE knows.

   WHY THE GHOST FRACTIONS ARE LOOSE HERE.  [sie_gname] is split 1/2 (in
   [sconf]) + 1/4 (in [intr_res]) + 1/8 ([sie_arm]) + 1/8 ([intr_count]).
   At usertrap's entry there IS no [intr_res] -- stvec points at the
   trampoline, no kernel handler is installed -- so that quarter is dangling,
   which is prepare_return's safety argument arriving intact.  And [sconf]
   cannot survive the [sret] either (it ties the SIE half to the LIVE
   mstatus, and the sret sets SIE := SPIE = 1 in user mode), so its half is
   loose too, at 'b"0" -- the value it had when prepare_return left and the
   value the trap restores by clearing SIE.  Same for the sret mirror: R
   holds BOTH halves, which is what makes the pair UPDATABLE across the sret
   that changes SPP/SPIE.  So the whole excursion moves no ghost, and the
   only fraction still bundled is [intr_count]'s, inside [cpu_own].

   THE STACK BUDGET is inside R rather than on the boundary for the same
   reason [av] is: the trampoline has no business knowing usertrap's frame
   depth.  [ut_res] carries [K_usertrap <= av] as a pure conjunct. *)

(* usertrap's own 32-byte frame is 4 slots; below it the deepest callee is
   syscall (whose own deepest table entry is sys_exit over kexit).  Written
   as an expression for the reason SpecSyscall.v writes K_syscall as one: a
   change to kexit's budget must not silently leave this one behind.  The
   others are all smaller and subsumed -- devintr 40, vmfault 38,
   printk-general 38, yield 20, killed/setkilled 14, prepare_return 12,
   myproc 10, and kexit itself 74 (which syscall's 82 already covers).

   AND [kv_frame_slots] ON TOP OF THAT, WHICH IS NOT AN OVERESTIMATE.  The
   [csrsi sstatus,2] at +0x9e RE-ENABLES INTERRUPTS before the [jal syscall],
   and an enabled arm's carve is [trap_res true + avail]
   ([IntrDefs.sie_cap]) -- so the leaf that performs the flip
   ([WpSconfCsr.wp_csrsi_sstatus_x0_enable_s_sconf]) is stated at pre index
   [trap_res true + n] and post index [n].  In other words the 78 slots
   kernelvec would need for a NESTED trap have to come out of usertrap's own
   budget at that instruction, exactly as scheduler()'s single real
   [intr_on] pays for them out of its.  Only the syscall arm needs it, but a
   function has one budget.  The other four arms never re-enable, so they
   fit in [4 + K_syscall] and nothing there notices. *)

     [ut_trap_open] hands out three of [trap_csrs]' six members loose -- the
     DANGLING SIE quarter, the KPT receipt and the sret mirror -- because at
     entry no kernel handler is installed, and an [intr_res] at TRAMPOLINE
     would be FALSE: uservec's contract is not [intr_handler_spec], since it
     never returns to the interrupted pc.  This is the step that makes it true
     again, and it is the exact inverse of what prepare_return's [csrci] does
     on the way out.

     THE ORDER IS FORCED, which is the theorem hiding in the C comment:
     nothing before this instruction may set SIE = 1, because
     [sie_ghost_flip] needs all three fractions and the quarter is not inside
     an [intr_res] to be found in.  xv6 writes stvec first and enables

  (* WHAT THE NAMES ARE SHARED BY -- this is the content of the union, and
     the reason it is one bundle rather than five:
       [un_u] (uart) is devintr's uartintr, printk-general's console, and
             kexit's [dev_inv];
       [un_v] (disk) and [un_k] (the virtio lock) are devintr's disk interrupt
             and kexit's begin_op/end_op cone;
       [un_s]  is the proc array, shared by killed / setkilled / yield /
             devintr's tick_keeper / kexit;
       [un_kl]/[un_ka] are kexit's kalloc pieces AND vmfault's [kalloc_env];
       [un_f]  is the open-file table, shared by syscall and kexit.
     Getting those identifications right is what makes the bundle coherent;
     five independently-named piles would be satisfiable by nobody.

     AND THEY ARE A RECORD, not a parameter list.  [SpecKexit.v] spells its
     thirty-odd names out because it is ONE contract; usertrap's walk is six
     block lemmas that each hand the whole pile to the next, and a
     thirty-argument list restated a dozen times is where a wrong
     identification hides.  [fclose_names] is the precedent -- and the
     equation SpecKexit takes as a premise ([fn = MkFCloseNames ...]) becomes

  (* [SpecDevintr.devintr_caps] has eight members and exactly one of them is
     hart-indexed: [TimerCap.timer_cap], which is [sstc_enabled ∗
     stimecmp_inv] over THIS hart's [mcounteren] and [stimecmp].  (The tick
     keeper's LEFT disjunct is hart-indexed too, but its real arm is not, and
     the real arm is the one the boot hart brings up.)

     THIS BUNDLE IS THE OTHER SEVEN, and it is hart-FREE by construction --
     invariants, locks and memory points-to, no register cell.  So it needs
     no quantifier at all: a holder can use it at whatever hart it happens to
     be on, which is what a resource that is FRAMED across steps at [b =
     true] must be able to do (SpecSyscall.v's note on [syscall_env] gives
     the same argument for the same reason).

     IT USED TO BE [□ ∀ h, devintr_caps (CID := h)], and that was not
     satisfiable by anybody.  [timer_cap] is minted PER HART, in that hart's
     own [BootChain.boot_entry_bridge], out of the [mcounteren] value
     timerinit wrote -- so the eight caps live in eight threads and there is
     nowhere they meet.  It cannot be done earlier either:
     [TimerCap.timer_cap_intro]'s first premise is that [mcounteren] ALREADY
     holds a TM-set value, and at the adequacy seam every hart is still at
     reset.

     THE FIX IS THE OTHER DIRECTION: the hart that RESUMES a parked process
     supplies its own [timer_cap], because it has one -- it came out of that
     hart's boot chain into [main] / [main_secondary] (both of which take it,
     and both of which join into [scheduler]).  So the capability travels
     with the RESUMER rather than with the record, exactly as [cpu_own] and
     [IntrDefs.hart_csrs] already do, and [devintr_caps_any_at] is where the
     two halves meet. *)

     what [FsReady.fs_ready] supplies, and what it does not.  THIS is the
     second half -- every [ut_caps] conjunct a parker must hold OUTRIGHT --
     and it is seven rows, all persistent, all in existence before either
     parker runs:

       [procs_inv]     the process table, which main builds at procinit
       [is_kstack]     the child's -- [forkret_park_body] takes it anyway
       [devintr_caps_any], the [wait_lock], [is_ftable]   main's, persistent
       [disk_geom] AT THE RECORD'S OWN THREE PAGES -- see below
       [fclose_ties]   pure: this record's names ARE the ambient ones

     THE DISK ROW IS THE ONLY ONE THAT IS NOT A COPY.  [fs_ready] QUANTIFIES
     the three ring pages (R1: [virtio_disk_init] [kalloc]s them at WP time,
     so no boot-era [fupd] could give [fscfg] a value for them), while
     [ut_caps] names them at the record's [un_pd]/[un_pav]/[un_pu].  A parker
     cannot choose its record to match a witness that does not exist yet, so
     it carries [disk_geom] at its OWN pages and [FsReady.disk_geom_agree]
     identifies the two -- which is exactly the recovery that lemma exists
     for, and what [ProofSyscall.sysc_fs_env] already does with it.

     THERE ARE NO TIES LEFT IN IT.  [SpecFileclose.fclose_ties] and the
     [un_pr] equation beside it both died with rank 1d: every field they
     named -- the uart, the disk, the two locks, the allocator pair, the bio
     record, the bitmap's two numbers and the printk gname -- is a
     [FsCfg.fscfg] field now, so a park package owes the file system nothing
     pure at all. *)

  (* ---- THE SAME TWO CROSSINGS, WITH THE IMAGE NAMED (milestone J, S3) ----
     [ut_res_pt_close] / [_pt_open] were stated at [proc_pt] / [proc_pt_any]
     -- the MAPPED view -- so the open threw the name away
     ([proc_ptm_pt]) and the close had to invent one
     ([proc_pt_ptm_any]).  The residue's own [ut_own] has held
     [proc_ptm … (uint (pv_sz (us_V U))) (us_M U)] all along

     proof minus that one weakening step -- which is exactly what the trap
     loop needs to hand user execution an image it can name.

     THE SIZE IS NOT A DEGREE OF FREEDOM: [ut_own]'s conjunct is at
     [uint (pv_sz (us_V U))], the process's own [p->sz], so both directions
     are stated there.  The IMAGE is: the bare residue does not own the user

  (* THE TRAPFRAME BORROW at the BARE residue.  This is the form uservec's

     out so the trap loop can put them in [UexecRet.uvb] as its [Rfd fdv],
     and the closer takes them back at the trap.

     THE CLOSER IS ∀-GENERAL IN THE STATES, and that is not slack -- it is
     what lets the syscall arm retype a descriptor.  The residue that comes
     back is indexed AT WHATEVER RETURNS, so the loop can close at the view
     the round actually left rather than the one it lent.  What forbids the
     PROCESS from moving them is not this lemma but [FdSlots.fd_st_both_update]:
     an update needs the authority too, and that stays here, inside
     [proc_priv_nopt].

     Note there is no matching "residue minus the fragments" DEFINITION: the

(* WHAT A PARKED RECORD MAY AND MAY NOT CARRY, and the rule is sharp.  A
   record is read at the context of whatever thread RESUMES it, which is
   not the context of the thread that wrote it -- and since the M1 flip an
   [is_lock]/[inv] handle over a [<{ P }>] payload is a DIFFERENT
   proposition at a different ξ (measured: [procs_inv], the console row,
   [disk_geom], [is_kstack] and every discarded cell all fail to be
   CONVERTIBLE across two contexts; [is_tickslock], the wait lock, the
   nextpid lock, [procs_avail], [wire_inv], [kmap_at], [console_caps] and --
   since §0.16′ -- [is_ftable] do cross, because their payloads are
   λ-converted and their handles are therefore context-free terms).  What
   the M3 sweep buys where it lands is not convertibility but
   TRANSPORTABILITY: a converted payload's handle is closed and the ACQUIRER
   re-indexes the resource along its [ctx_dom].  Invariant bodies are not
   updatable, so no transport exists and none can be written.

   SO THE ξ-DEPENDENT ROWS MOVE INSIDE THE ∀ AND ARE SUPPLIED BY THE
   RESUMER, at its own context -- the same channel [W] / [first_done] /
   [timer_cap] already use.  This is that bundle.  It is exactly the rows
   that are ξ-dependent AND not reachable from [FirstTok.first_done] (which
   is [first_addr ↦₄□ 0 ∗ FsReady.fs_ready], and the file system is most of
   what [ut_caps] wants):

                        TERM (tso-port.md §0.16′) and so it crosses for
                        nothing -- but it stays in this bundle, because the
                        rest of the bundle does not.  It used to be the
                        blocker: [ftable_res] reached the old off-borrow
                        [cinv] over a ξ-indexed body (now the off LEDGER,
                        outside the lock resource entirely), which no
                        [CtxMorph] can cross.  The off-borrow ruling made
                        that body ξ-free and the payload was then
                        λ-converted, exactly as [KallocInv]'s [kmem_res] was;
                        [file_core]'s [is_pipe] was λ-converted a tranche
                        earlier.  (tso-park-protocol-memo.md called this one

(* ====================================================================== *)
(* THE PARK'S ONE MOVE, GENERIC IN THE SYSCALL ENVIRONMENT.                *)
(* ====================================================================== *)
(* OUTSIDE THE SECTION, for the reason the transports above are: the closer
   is quantified over the hart the record may resume on, so [CID] has to be
   a free argument rather than a section variable.

   WHAT THIS IS.  Everything a party that has never trapped hands over so
   that the process it is parking can enter the trap loop.  The environment
   [Rsys] is abstract for the usual reason -- [ProofSyscall] is a proof file
   and this is not -- so it arrives as a WAND out of [FirstTok.first_done],
   and that indirection is the whole design: at userinit's park the file
   system does not exist yet, so nothing owned outright could stand in for
   it.  See SpecForkret.v's last header section.

   Applying the closer consumes the closer, so the wand and [park_own] are
   spent exactly when the record is resumed, which is exactly once.

   [ut_park_caps] and the [Rsys] wand are separate premises on purpose: the
   caps half is process/device plumbing every parker already has, and the
   [Rsys] half is the syscall table's, which only [SpecSyscall.SYSCALL] can
   produce ([syscall_env_park]). *)
(* THE RESUMER'S ENVIRONMENT, OUT OF TWO CONTEXTS (L8, A12.19).  The parker's
   [ut_park_caps] is at the parker's (ambient) context; the resumer runs at
   [Xc] and supplies its own [park_globals] and [fs_ready] there.  Everything
   context-indexed in [ut_caps] is rebuilt at [Xc]: the file-system rows out
   of [fs_ready], the globals as handed in, [devintr_caps_any] and
   [park_world] reassembled from both.  The parker's copies of [disk_geom]
   and [is_kstack] pin the record's values by agreement across contexts;
   [procs_avail], [wire_inv] and [kmap_at] are context-free and come out of
   the parker's [park_world].  tso-flip's [ut_caps_of_park], with main's
   rows (no ties: the names are ambient here). *)

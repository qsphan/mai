(* WpLockAt.v -- [newlock] AT A PRE-ALLOCATED gname.

   [WpLock.newlock] and [WpLock.newlock_delayed] both mint the lock-state
   gname themselves and return it existentially.  A client whose OTHER
   resources have to MENTION that gname cannot use either form: the gname has
   to be fixed before the resource can be stated, and an ambient
   configuration field cannot be an existential
   (claude-notes/projects/fs-cfg-boot.md, "THE PRINCIPLE").

   So the ghost step is separable, exactly as [SleepLock.slh_ghost_alloc] /
   [SleepLock.new_sleeplock_gen_at] separate the sleeplock's:

     lock_ghost_alloc  -- pick the gname (a plain [bupd]: no mask, no
                          physical premise, so it runs in a boot fupd before
                          any lock address exists)
     lock_free_tok γ   -- what an UNBUILT lock's free arm wants: the state
                          authority and its fragment, both at [None]
     newlock_at        -- [newlock] minus that one [own_alloc]

   A leaf file: nothing existing changes, and [newlock_delayed] stays for the
   callers that do want a fresh name. *)

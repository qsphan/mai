(* SpecAcquire.v -- the public interface of Acquire, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof
   file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   The lock's [cpu] word is owned by the lock invariant (WpLock.v), so no cell
   is threaded here.  What the caller gets back is the [locked γl cpu_id]
   token, which PINS [lk->cpu] at this hart's [struct cpu] -- so release needs
   nothing else.

   THE CALLER DOES PROVE IT IS NOT ALREADY HOLDING THE LOCK, and it proves it
   with the premise it was already carrying.  acquire's
   [if(holding(lk)) panic("acquire")] arm used to be discharged by a panic
   credential -- so the spec read "acquire either returns holding the lock, or
   panics".  It now reads "acquire returns holding the lock", because the arm
   is DEAD: holding() decides its answer from [lk->cpu] inside the lock
   invariant, whose held state keeps [lk_in i s] beside that word, and this
   hart's held-set authority (inside [cpu_own], with [s ∉ lks]) refutes
   [i = cpu_id].  See WpLock.v's owner-field block, which states the theorem,
   and [WpSconfLock.wp_cld_lkcpu_lockopen_notheld_s_sconf], which cashes it.

   ==================================================================== *)
(*  TWO TIERS OF HELD-SET PRECONDITION, AND WHY BOTH EXIST.

   Each contract below is an instance of ONE core body indexed by the
   precondition it puts on the caller's held set [lks]:

     FRESH   [s ∉ lks]            -- what the MACHINE needs.
     BELOW   [locks_below lks s]  -- what the DISCIPLINE requires.

   The proof consumes only the first.  All the ghost step does is insert [s]
   into this hart's held set, and a [gset] insert is sound exactly when the
   element is not already there (LockSet.v's header: an unconditional insert
   beside a membership tie is inconsistent).  Nothing in acquire's WP needs an
   ORDER at all -- the spin loop is a Löb loop, so a spec for a blocking
   acquire is provable however the locks are ranked.

   The order is therefore a POLICY, imposed here rather than discovered:
   [locks_below lks s] is the deadlock-freedom discipline (the held set is a
   chain in [LockRank.lock_rank]'s total order, so no cycle of waiting harts
   can form), and every ordinary caller must meet it.  Dropping to FRESH keeps
   the proof sound and gives up the global no-deadlock argument for that one
   call site, which then owes its own reason not to block.  Use it ONLY where
   such a reason exists and is written down; [iput]'s nested [acquiresleep] --
   licensed by icache REF-1 exclusivity rather than by rank -- is the case the
   tier exists for (claude-notes/completed/lock-set.md, "THE ONE UNLICENSED
   EDGE").

   BELOW IS A BOUND, NOT A NON-MEMBERSHIP, AND THE REASON IS COMPOSITION.  [∉]
   does not compose: a function that transitively acquires k locks needs k
   separate premises, and every caller inherits all of them, so the premise set
   grows with the transitive closure of the call graph.  [iput] alone would
   carry three ("itable" directly, "sleep lock" via acquiresleep, "log" via
   iupdate -> log_write).  The bound carries ONE, at the LOWEST rank the
   function touches, and the rest are consequences: [locks_below_mono] weakens
   it to every higher rank and [locks_below_not_elem] turns each into the
   non-membership the ghost step actually consumes.  Nesting composes too --
   [locks_below_union_singleton] takes [locks_below lks r] across an acquire at
   [r] to [locks_below ({[r]} ∪ lks) r'] for any [r < r'].  That is why BELOW,
   not FRESH, is what a FUNCTION contract states; FRESH is for the one call
   site that cannot state a bound.

   EITHER TIER KILLS THE [if(holding(lk)) panic] ARM, and neither carries a
   panic credential.  Both give [s ∉ lks] (BELOW via
   [LockRank.locks_below_not_elem]), and that is exactly what the refutation
   consumes: [wp_ld_lkcpu_lockopen_gen]'s view premise now also sees the
   invariant's held-set fragment [WpLock.lk_cpu_frag], so the read at
   holding+0x12 concludes the owner word is not this hart's, and
   [SpecHolding]'s first contract concludes [a0 = 0] outright.  The fragment
   never leaves the invariant: the premise's conclusion is pure, so the proof
   mode keeps it and the leaf closes with it. *)

(* The generic form, over [lock_openable] (WpLock.v): the right to TOUCH the
   lock is the resource [Tc], presented on the way in and handed back on the
   way out -- for a kalloc'd object that is a REFERENCE to it, which is what
   makes the storage reclaimable (a hart with no reference cannot even take
   the lock).  acquire opens the invariant four times; the first three present
   [Tc] and the last presents the [locked_pre] token it has just won, so the
   caller owes a refutation of the dead state [Dc] for each.  acquire disposes
   of nothing, so [Dc] merely rides along.  A static kernel lock instantiates
   at [Dc := False] ([wp_acquire_pre_body] below).

   [pre] is the held-set precondition; see the tier note in the file header.
   It is the LAST argument so that it reads as an index on an otherwise fixed
   contract, exactly as [lks] itself does on [cpu_own]. *)

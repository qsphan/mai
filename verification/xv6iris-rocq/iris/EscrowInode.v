  (* ---- THE FREEZE TOKEN RIDES THE ESCROW (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, A⁗) ---

     The EMPTY state carries [ifreeze_post z] and the FILLED one
     [ifreeze_off z], and that ONE placement does three jobs at once:

     (a) it gives [IcacheEscrow.pool_await] its refuter back.  IIIa parked
         [ifreeze_post] in the pool's await arm itself, and A⁗ cannot: the
         phase fragment has to stay reachable by the OFF-LOCK deposit at
         iput+0xba, which runs after the pool bundle has gone back under the
         itable lock at +0x94.  Here it is reachable from both sides -- the
         deposit opens [escAN z] anyway, and a RECYCLER peeling the await arm
         opens it too and finds the standing freeze, which its licence then
         refutes ([IgetLic.iname_freeze_off]: a licence puts the column at
         [FrzOff], §2.6's table).  §1.3's original design, at last buildable.
     (b) it retires the token at the one instant the free path's type-0 write
         lands: [escA_deposit] hands [ifreeze_post] OUT to
         [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] (which steps the column back to
         [FrzOff]) and takes the returned [ifreeze_off] IN, so the deposit
         needs no token premise from the walk at all.
     (c) it re-arms the pool: [escA_redeem] hands the [ifreeze_off] to
         whoever converts the await arm to [imark], which is exactly the
         token [IcacheEscrow.ipool_shape_np]'s ordinary arms owe.
     REDEEMED holds neither: by then the token is in the peeler's hand and
     the pool entry is an ordinary one. *)
  (* ...AND THE DEPOSIT TICKET [gd], the third gname (§3.16).  It is the
     freer's proof that ITS deposit has not run: minted with the escrow,
     carried in the freer's own hand from iput+0x8a to the off-lock ifree at
     +0xba, and PARKED here by the deposit itself.  Without it the deposit
     cannot rule the REDEEMED arm out -- [imark] refutes FILLED but a peeler
     has already carried the marker away by REDEEMED -- and with it both bad
     arms die on one [Excl] apiece.  It is the ordinary "this one-shot has not
     fired" token; [redeem_ticketA]'s RA, at a second name. *)
  (* RULING G' (iclaim-ledger.md §6''): the escrow is INDEXED by the regime
     arm its freezer lent.  It has to be: the standing [ifreeze_post] lives
     here between iput+0x8a and the off-lock deposit, and it is that token's
     agreement with the region's f column that tells the deposit which arm to
     hand back.  The index is carried by the walk (in [redeem_ticketA gd]'s
     company) from the mint to the deposit, so the tie is structural. *)
  (* ---- AND THE ERA'S ABSTRACT VALUE RIDES THE EMPTY ARM (C-3c) --------

     Supplier (D) of [FsCollect]'s collection needs a FREE inum's [top_frag]
     to be parked WITH its record, i.e. region-side ([InodeRegion.ireg_top_park]).
     The one mover that creates a free record is iput's off-lock deposit
     ([EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au]), and the fragment it must park is
     the one the freed PAYLOAD carried -- which the walk gives up at +0x94,
     when it parks the pool entry, twenty instructions before the deposit.
     So the fragment travels the same road the standing freeze does: in HERE,
     at the mint, and out again at the deposit's own opening.  It is the
     [ifreeze_post] argument verbatim, and for the same reason (this file's
     (a)/(b) above): the EMPTY arm is the one place both ends can reach. *)
  (* ---- WHAT THE FILLED ARM HOLDS SINCE durable-disk C-7 ---------------

     NOT the region marker any more: [InodeRegion.imark] is what the commit's
     collection needs at a freed-but-unrecycled inum (it refutes the region
     slot's own MARKED arm and leaves the free bundle on the PENDING one),
     and this escrow is an [inv] behind the itable spinlock, so the commit
     cannot reach it.  The marker therefore rides the CORPSE LEDGER, whose
     authority is a conjunct of [IcacheEscrow.ipool_body]; what stands in its
     place here is that ledger row's ELEMENT at [CrpDep].

     THE SWAP IS WHAT TIES THE TWO ONE-SHOTS TOGETHER, and that is its whole
     point.  This escrow and the ledger both record "has the deposit run",
     and a recycler that peels the escrow must be able to conclude the
     ledger's state from it: it does, because the element it gets back here
     agrees with the ledger's authority by [ghost_map_lookup]
     ([IcacheEscrow.ipool_take_lend]).  Without the swap the two state
     machines are untied and the recycle cannot produce the marker at all. *)

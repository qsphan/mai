(* WpDecodeBridge.v -- the per-word concrete/symbolic decode bridge.

   Decoding a 32-bit word over a SYMBOLIC system state is slow: the decoder's
   Zicfilp / Zihintpause / extension-gate probes read symbolic config registers,
   so [vm_compute] gets stuck and the decode must be peeled clause-by-clause by
   hand (decode_any: ~4-11s per instruction).  Over a FULLY CONCRETE state every
   probe read resolves, so [vm_compute] reduces the whole decoder in one pass
   (~0.02-0.05s -- two orders of magnitude faster).

   This file makes the concrete result usable for the symbolic proofs.  It proves
   a generic read-frame congruence ([exec_goodb_congr], by induction on the monad
   -- NOT by traversing the decoder), packages the concrete reference state
   [dstate], and exposes the transport as [decode_state_bridge].

   The transport condition is PER WORD: [s] must agree with [dstate] on exactly
   the registers THAT word's decode reads -- the set [D]; its complement is the
   per-word DON'T-CARE set.  Both dst-side obligations ([goodb D (ext_decode w)
   dstate] and the concrete decode) are single [vm_compute]s.  A decode lemma reads

     Lemma decode_foo s : agree_on D_foo s (dstate Machine) ->
                          exec (ext_decode w_foo) s = Some (i, s).

   The concrete register values are chosen CONSISTENT with [hw_config]
   (RiscvFetchExec.v): [misa] has S/C/U/M/A set, and [mseccfg]'s PMM field is
   Disabled with MLPE clear (both hold of the all-zero / [MISA_C] choices here).*)

(* WpUart.v -- reasoning about the UART + PLIC device fabric (DevModel.v).

   Contents:
   §1  device-fabric ghost bridges: agreement/update of the [uart_frag]/
       [plic_frag] halves against [dev_interp].  (The per-hart register
       machinery [reg_pointsto_at]/[reg_valid_at]/[reg_update_at]/
       [gregs_interp_acc_at] the wire step rides on lives in RiscvPtsto.v;
       the invariant owning the wires themselves is [wire_inv], WireInv.v.)
   §2  MMIO transaction leaves: [dev_read]/[dev_write] reductions for the
       UART registers xv6 touches, and the [exec]-level towers
       (read_ram/write_ram -> checked_mem_read/write -> mem_read/
       mem_write_value) for a 1-byte device access in Machine mode --
       the device twins of WpLoad.v / WpGprStore.v's RAM towers.
   §3  the DEVICE THREADS: [wp_uart_loop] / [wp_disk_loop] /
       [wp_plic_loop] -- the three device execution contexts, each running
       forever under ITS OWN invariant ([uart_inv] / [disk_inv] /
       [plic_inv]), plus, for the wire, the wire invariant [wire_inv] (every
       hart's [sig_seip]/[sig_meip] pin, WireInv.v).  [dev_inv] is retained
       as the persistent BUNDLE of the three, which is what every
       client-facing spec in the tree takes.  This is the shape of every
       future driver-vs-device proof: CPU-side WPs and a device loop share
       one sub-invariant, and a CPU-side proof opens only the sub-invariant
       of the device it touches.
   §4  the interrupt chain, as pure facts: UART rx-avail raises the level
       ([uart_irq]), the gateway latches it ([plic_latch]), the latched
       source drives the hart's EIP wire ([plic_eip_uart]), and a high
       [sig_seip] wire makes the S-mode dispatch fire
       ([s_dispatch_seip_fires], against WpIntrCore's [s_dispatch]). *)

         [uart_acc] (that is the whole point of tracking the concatenation);
       - a THR push DOES change [uart_acc], so it needs both halves -- the
         invariant's and the owner's.  A hart without the token therefore
         cannot push at all, which is what pins the FIFO between a THRE poll

  (* ---- THE PAYOFF ----

     This is what the whole ghost arrangement exists to prove, and it is worth
     stating on its own because it is the design's crux.

     A driver polls the LSR, sees THRE, and only then writes the byte.  For
     that write not to be silently dropped it needs the FIFO to still have
     room WHEN IT LANDS -- a fact about a LATER state, across which both the
     device thread and every other hart may have run.

     Given the transmitter token and the bound the poll handed back, the two
     premises of [uart_write_thr_acc] (DevModel.v) follow at ANY later opening
     of the invariant:

       - the token pins [uart_acc u2 = l], because the only transition that
         grows the accepted trace is a THR push and a push needs the token's
         half of the ghost_var_frac, which we are holding;
       - [uart_out_lb] says the transmitted prefix has already reached [l],
         and the device can only ever extend it;
       - so by [uart_tx_still_empty] there is nothing left in the FIFO;
       - and the frozen [uart_dlab_off] says offset 0 really is THR.

     Note what is NOT needed: any assumption about the other harts' code.  A
     hart without the token simply cannot perform a push, so exclusion is by
     ghost arithmetic rather than by trusting anyone's proof. *)

  (* THE COLUMN.  [hs !! j] is the history at which [u_rx u !! j] arrived, so
     the byte is that history's last event and the application's claim about
     it is [riscv_rx_tag] there.  [np] counts pushes and [nk] removals, and
     their difference IS the queue's length -- the arithmetic that turns a
     poll's data-ready into a pop's the-head-exists.

     ...AND IT IS ORDERED (app-echo.md, lane CONS-CURSOR, C1).  Four more
     clauses, and three pieces of vocabulary:

     * the CHAIN: [hs] is in trace order, STRICTLY -- an earlier slot's
       history is a proper prefix of a later one's.  That is what makes the
       queue a SEQUENCE of input bytes rather than a bag of them, and it is
       the only thing a reader further down the line can turn into "these
       bytes arrived in this order";
     * the ANCHOR [hl], the token's, strictly before every queued history --
       so the order does not die when the queue drains;
     * the TOP [ht], at or after the anchor and after everything queued.  It
       is an EXPLICIT existential and not [last hs] on purpose: the push has
       to know that its new history is after EVERY history the column holds,
       and one bound that dominates them all says so without a single
       [last]/[lookup] argument.  Its lower bound [obs_hist_lb] is the
       column's only non-persistent-by-accident conjunct, and it is what the
       push compares against the machine's own history.

     LOOP MUST BE OFF.  Under MCR bit 4 the transmitter's drain re-enters
     this UART's own receiver ([DevModel.uart_tx_pop]'s loopback arm) with no
     observation at all, so it would lengthen [u_rx] with no tag to file.
     The clause holds at power-on ([uart_mcr_reset] is OUT2 alone) and every
     transition but an MCR write preserves it.

     ...AND THE WIRE IS THE DRAINED SEQUENCE, which is the same clause read
     forward: [u_wire u = u_out u].  It is INDUCTIVE and not derivable
     pointwise -- the drain appends to [u_wire] only when LOOP is off
     ([ObsTrace.uart_tx_pop_wire]), and that LOOP is off is this column's
     own preceding clause, so the two have to be carried together.  The
     language's own step invariant is only the weaker
     [UartAccepted.out_wire_ok] ([u_wire] a SUBLIST of [u_out]), which is
     what a byte drained under LOOP would leave behind.  What the equality
     buys is the INDEX: the trace ledger's transmit wand is handed
     [obs_wire (open_seg h) = u_wire u], and a drained byte sits at accepted
     position [length (u_out u)] -- the two are the same position exactly
     because of this clause. *)

  (* [out_res_at], [out_claim_at], [uart_out_claim] and their four laws
     lived here: the output claim's port indexing and the clause the
     invariant carried for it.  [chist_at] and [cons_claim_at] below are
     the successors -- ONE claim at ONE witness, where these were the first
     of two.

     THE ERA INDEX [k] IS EXPLICIT in the successor, and instantiated at
     [S gen_id] by the invariant's own clause.  Explicit, because the LINKS
     -- what the application supplies and what a writer spends -- are stated
     at a BOUND [k] and proved once for every era; instantiated by the
     invariant, because the port's claim is THIS era's and nothing else's,
     and threading a second index through [uart_inv] and its hundreds of
     carriers would say the same thing at a much greater cost.

     AND WHY THE WITNESS HISTORY IS EXISTENTIAL, which the successor keeps.
     The obvious form -- the claim at the receive column's TOP history -- is
     TRUE but NOT DISCHARGEABLE by any writer: a writer's view shift is
     handed the history as an opaque list, and nothing it holds orders ITS
     byte's history against the column's top.  Binding the witness instead
     promises "there is a REAL PREFIX of the run's history for which the
     boundary is good", the reality witnessed by the monotone lower bound
     [RiscvPtsto.obs_hist_lb].  A shift may then MOVE the witness forward --
     to its own byte's history, which it holds a bound on -- and the ledger
     reads the claim at a witness it can place inside the run's own history
     and lifts it there by the application's own input-monotonicity.
     NOTHING IS LOST: the claim is strongest at the empty witness, no writer
     can exhibit a witness that is not a real prefix, and no step of the
     invariant but the transmit store touches it. *)

     A PAIR AND NOT A BOUND (lane CONS-IO milestone B, ruling F4): the
     ring's gap accumulator quantifies over the log entries ABOVE the
     ring's top, and a [mono_list] lower bound cannot exclude an entry that
     was appended after the bound was taken.  The pair says [L = pops]
     outright, which is what a read needs at the fire and what an append
     needs to reinstall the accumulator.  Only consoleintr moves it, and it

     the reader's LEASE, where the lag between the ring's consumed count
     and the boundary's [dl] is nobody's business; so the ring cannot read
     an upper bound on [dl] off it.  A full-ring drop needs exactly that
     bound -- the boundary is told "the log holds 128 echoed entries beyond
     the delivered ones", and the ring proves it from [cur + 128] echoed
     entries and [length dl <= cur].  The number is what makes the second

     entry (so [None] is a PURE side condition it can prove), advances both,
     and returns them at [None] when the arm closes.

     WHY THE KERNEL OWNS IT.  consoleintr holds cons.lock for the whole arm,
     so two arms cannot overlap; but the application's echo obligation is
     persistent and its run is split across several fupds, so nothing in the
     obligation's own premises says that.  Today the application is lent an
     exclusive of its own to tell a first firing from a second, and refutes

  (* The PLIC half carries [plic_ok] (DevModel.v): every hart's S-context
     enable word names only the sources this machine has.  It is the loosest
     property that still lets a device-interrupt proof rule out a bogus
     enable bit, and it is per-hart-local enough that a hart running
     [plicinithart] concurrently with the others re-establishes it from its
     own write alone. *)
  (* The VIRTIO half carries the disk's DRIVER PROTOCOL ([virtio_proto],
     VirtioProto.v): the DMA lease -- ownership of every byte the device may
     write, plus the positive obligation that the queue its configuration
     names really does live inside those bytes -- held in the KEYED,
     per-request form, together with the resources the driver deposits at
     publish and withdraws at reclaim (the disk points-to auth, the receipts,
     the completed/published counters).  Unlike the other two halves this one
     is not merely a mirror of the device state -- it is what MAKES the device
     thread's DMA step justifiable, since the thread has to own what it
     overwrites.  It rides in [dev_inv] rather than in a separate invariant
     because the driver hands the lease over (and takes it back) at exactly
     the MMIO writes that already open this one.

     It also carries [virtio_isr_ok] (VirtioModel.v), the exact analogue of
     the PLIC's [plic_ok]: the interrupt-status register holds only the two
     bits the spec defines, which is what makes [virtio_disk_intr]'s 0x3
     acknowledgement provably drop the interrupt line ([virtio_ack_clears]). *)
  (* [uart_preinit] is the UART slot's PRE-STATE, which the allocation puts
     into the PLIC invariant's left arm: the receive token itself goes to the
     boot chain, which carries it to uartinit's FCR flush and deposits it
     afterwards ([uart_rx_tok_deposit]). *)
  (* THE BUNDLE IS THE CONSOLE PORT'S, and deliberately so.  The board has
     two 16550s; xv6 drives ONE of them (the console, [Uart0]) and nothing in
     the kernel names the other, so the bundle every client spec takes stays
     the console's and the second port's invariant is a separate, equally
     ordinary [uart_inv Uart1 γ1] that only adequacy and that port's own
     device thread hold.  "New specs take only the invariant(s) they use" --
     widening the bundle would put a resource nobody uses into 140 specs. *)

     newest byte I hold" must be known to be OLDER than the byte being
     filed.  So the payload carries the consumer's high-water half beside

     every STORE, this one is re-established at every ACCEPTED byte -- so
     it is what licenses the shift on the arms that file nothing (a drop, a
     NUL, an erase) as much as on the store.  At [Uart1] there is no
     consumer and no log, so it never moves and stays at [None], exactly as

  (* THE ECHO WINDOW TOKEN was a FOURTH conjunct here until redesign R2 --

     WHY IT IS STOPPABLE, and why the log entry comes last.  The kill-line
     arm calls consputc once per erased glyph and the count is the ring's
     content, which the shift's caller cannot name when the shift fires: it
     is an [iLöb], not a fuel induction.  So the caller commits to an UPPER
     BOUND [bs] (the pending window's length, in hand under cons.lock), the
     loop walks the run one triple at a time, and whichever exit fires
     closes the log at exactly the bytes that went out -- [pre].  A chain
     that had to be spent whole could not be given to that loop, and a log
     entry written before the loop would have to name a count nobody knows.

     WHY THE BYTES COME FIRST is the application's side of the same coin:
     the log entry and the accepted byte can never move in ONE fupd (the
     accepted sequence grows in the THR store's own ghost step), so one of
     the two intermediates has to be expressible, and it is this one --
     after the store the wire carries exactly the transcript the log will

     of them has any business naming [Uart1]'s ghosts -- so the bundle says
     only "the one PLIC invariant exists", which is all a client borrowing
     [plic_frag] needs.  Anything that must name the second port's names --
     the claim's payload, the completion's park, the second slot's deposit --
     takes the BARE [plic_inv γ γ1] as its own premise instead
     (SpecPlicinit/SpecPlicClaim/SpecPlicComplete/SpecDevintr), exactly as
     "new specs take only the invariant(s) they use" says. *)

     predicate ([obs_inv]), so the move is the CLIENT's step, and this is
     its shape: with the arm's own event (at the device state it leaves,

     device's [u_wire] -- and the device ghosts AFTER the step in hand, move
     the history by the event.  It runs inside [uartN] (hence the mask), so
     a client's trace predicate may relate the history to the device ghosts;
     [obsN] is disjoint from [uartN], so the predicate can be opened there.

         not, so this is the ONLY step in the whole machine at which the
         durable image MOVES: the client's per-sector view shift runs here,
         on the crash predicate, at the instant those 512 bytes become
         durable.  A power cycle between two of these leaves a half-written

         layer must survive.

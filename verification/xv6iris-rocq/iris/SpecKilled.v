(* SpecKilled.v -- the public interface of killed(), stated independently of
   its proof.

     int killed(struct proc *p) {
       int k;
       acquire(&p->lock);
       k = p->killed;
       release(&p->lock);
       return k;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.killed = 0x80002142, nineteen instructions: a 32-byte
   ra/s0/s1/s2 frame, [c.mv s1,a0] to park [p] across the calls,
   acquire, [c.lw a5,40(s1)] (p->killed), [c.mv s2,a5] to park the value
   across release, release, [c.mv a0,s2].

   THE POINT.  This is the first consumer of the always-resident row of the
   proc lock invariant: [p_killed] lives in [SchedCtx.proc_pub], at the TOP
   LEVEL of [proc_lock_res], so killed() reaches it by opening the lock and
   destructing one existential -- it never learns the process's state and
   never touches either of the two [proc_slots] guards.  Before that rewiring
   the field was not modelled at all.

   The returned value is universally quantified in the continuation: the
   invariant says nothing about [p->killed], so a caller must accept whatever
   it reads (the same shape as sys_uptime's tick value).  It is
   [sign_extend' 64 kl] because [c.lw] is a signed 32-bit load widening to
   the [int] return type.

   The panic credentials are threaded because acquire takes them (its "acquire" panic on a
   doubly-held lock). *)

  (* WHAT THE READ MAY LEARN, AND IT IS THE CALLER WHO SAYS (lane

     flag is [ChildTok.kill_shot], the incarnation's kill one-shot, which
     is persistent and therefore outlives this critical section -- and that
     fact is about a GENERATION, while <p->lock>'s payload names the
     generation only existentially.  So the identification is the caller's
     to make, out of resources killed() has no business owning, and it
     makes it HERE, inside the critical section, on the two pieces this
     function has open.
       usertrap's exit route lends the quarter of [p->pid] and the
     registration eighth its own block carries ([ProcInv.proc_priv_pid],
     [ProcInv.proc_priv_reg]) and takes [⌜kl = 0⌝ ∨ ChildTok.kill_shot gn]
     back beside them ([SchedCtx.kill_paid_shot]); the five callers that
     only want the number lend [emp] and take [emp].
       PERSISTENT and PURE-CONCLUDING: the two agreements it runs are pure,
     so nothing of the payload is spent and the row goes back untouched.

(* SpecEndOp.v -- the public interface of end_op, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void end_op(void) {
       int do_commit = 0;
       acquire(&log.lock);
       if (log.committing) panic("log.committing");
       log.outstanding -= 1;
       if (log.outstanding == 0) { do_commit = 1; log.committing = 1; }
       else wakeup(&log);
       release(&log.lock);
       if (do_commit) {
         commit();                     // INLINED, and write_log with it
         acquire(&log.lock);
         log.committing = 0;
         log.ncommit++;
         wakeup(&log);
         release(&log.lock);
       }
     }

   Both [commit] and [write_log] are static with end_op their only caller, so
   gcc inlined them: this ONE function contains the accounting critical
   section, the wakeup arm, the whole write_log copy loop (bread the log
   slot, bread the home block, memmove, bwrite, brelse x2) and the
   write_head / install_trans(0) / write_head commit sequence.

   THE CONTRACT.  In: one operation's token, whatever budget is left on it
   ([log_op γ u] for ANY u -- callers do not track how many log_writes they
   did, exactly as the C code does not).  Out: nothing log-specific -- the
   token is RETIRED ([LogInv.log_end_step]) and the operation is over.
   Whether this particular end_op is the last one out, and therefore
   whether it runs the commit, is INTERNAL: the spec deliberately does not
   expose which, because no caller can predict it and no caller needs to.
   The commit path checks [log_state] out of the lock resource under
   [committing = 1] and deposits it back before returning, so the batch
   never appears in the interface either.

   The "log.committing" PANIC IS DEAD: an op token in hand forces
   outstanding >= 1 ([LogInv.log_op_positive]), and log_res's pure conjunct
   [cmt = true -> out = 0] then refutes committing.

   end_op sleeps (bread / bwrite inside the commit), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does, plus the disk fabric
   and [bio_ctx]; it enters and returns at noff 0.

   SLOT ACCOUNTING, AND WHY IT CLOSES.  The interior install_trans hands
   back [bslots (2 + length W)] having taken 2 -- one surplus unit per
   installed block, the units log_write's bpin absorbed.  They are not
   dropped: end_op deposits them into [log_state]'s POOL when it re-forms
   the batch at n = 0.  The arithmetic is exact -- length W = n, and the
   pool goes from [(LOGBLOCKS - n) + 2] to [(LOGBLOCKS - 0) + 2].  Nothing
   about it crosses this interface; end_op's post stays empty. *)

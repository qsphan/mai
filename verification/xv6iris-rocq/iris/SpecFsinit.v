       struct buf *bp;

       bp = bread(dev, 1);                 // readsb(dev, &sb), INLINED

   112 bytes, a FOUR-slot frame ([c.addi sp,sp,-32] at +0x00, a plain
   [c.addi] -- so [stk_push_32] / [stk_pop_32] / [stk_fp_32], not the
   [c.addi16sp] family every deeper fs function uses).  [s2 = dev],
   [s1 = bp].  readsb is INLINED: there is no [jal readsb], only the
   bread / memmove / brelse triple at +0x10 / +0x26 / +0x2c.

   ==== WHY THIS FILE IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER Spec IN THE TREE ====

   THE [memmove] AT +0x26 IS WHERE EVERY SUPERBLOCK CELL IS BORN.

   Thirteen contracts in this tree take a superblock field as a premise --
   [BitmapInv.sb_size], [BitmapInv.sb_bmapstart], [InodeInv.sb_ninodes],
   [InodeInv.sb_inodestart], and the [sb + 20] fsc_logst cell SpecInitlog
   names inline -- always in the same shape: a plain fractional cell, read,
   never written, handed straight back.  NONE of them says where the cell
   came from or why its VALUE is any particular number.  There is
   deliberately no superblock abstraction anywhere below this file
   (BitmapInv.v and InodeInv.v both say so out loud).

   This is the function that answers both questions at once.  Before +0x26,
   [&sb] is 32 bytes of .bss -- raw, untyped, uninitialised.  After it, the
   eight words are there, and their VALUES are the mkfs image's block 1.  So
   this contract is the only place in the tree where a fact about the
   superblock can be stated as a fact about anything at all, and that is why
   the whole campaign has been parking its geometry IOUs here since N4b.

   ---- THE IOUs, NOW PAID -- OR RATHER, NOW STATED SOMEWHERE REAL ------

   Every one of these was flagged "owed to SpecFsinit" by an earlier stage
   and none of them could be stated before this file existed:

   - [1 < ninodes]                   (N5c, SpecIalloc / SpecIreclaim: kills
                                      the empty-region early return)
   - [ninodes <= 16 * Z.of_nat nib]  (N5c's NEW premise -- nothing anywhere
                                      in the tree tied sb.ninodes to the
                                      inode region's block count)
   - [ninodes < 2 ^ 31]              (makes the scan's [lw]/[bgeu] numeric)
   - [icfg_dev = ROOTDEV]            (N4b/N4d, namex's absolute arm)
   - [(0 < icfg_nib)%nat]            (N4b/N4d, iget's region bound)

   They are stated here as premises ABOUT THE IMAGE'S BLOCK 1 -- see
   [sb_image] below -- and they are THREADED, not discharged.  That is the
   honest shape and it is deliberate: they are claims about what mkfs wrote,
   so they belong to the same image-well-formedness family as
   [IcacheBoot.ipool_alloc]'s allocated-inum bundles, [InodeLock.inode_ok]
   and [DirView.dir_ok].  The boot client supplies them; no function proof
   can, and an axiom would be a lie.  What this file BUYS is that from here
   up they are premises about a named 32-byte record instead of five
   free-floating unexplained hypotheses on five different contracts.

   ---- THE TWO-LINE DEVICE PREMISE, IN SpecNamex's EXACT SHAPE ---------

   N5a's ledger settled where these go and it is here, not in IcacheBoot:
   [icache_boot] is device-generic BY CONSTRUCTION (it takes [dv] and [nib]
   as parameters), and the [dv = icfg_dev] tie is [IcacheRefDefs.icfg_alloc]'s to
   make.  The two TIES that used to ride here ([dev = icfg_dev],
   [nib = icfg_nib]) are gone with the threaded copies (rank 1c); what is
   left is what they were there to enable -- [icfg_dev = ROOTDEV] and
   [(0 < icfg_nib)%nat] -- and ireclaim gets the same form as before.

   [ROOTDEV] itself was hoisted out of [SpecNamex.v] into [InodeInv.v] (N5d,
   beside [sb_ninodes]) precisely so that this file could name it: a Spec
   file must not require another function's Spec.  SpecNamex keeps
   unqualified abbreviations, so nothing there moved.

   ---- THE MAGIC TEST IS A LIVE ARM, AND IT IS AN IMAGE PREMISE --------

   [bne a4,a5] at +0x40 compares [sb.magic] against [FSMAGIC = 0x10203040]
   ([lui a5,0x10203 / addi a5,a5,64] at +0x38/+0x3c) and jumps to
   [jal panic] at +0x6c.  Unlike balloc's and ialloc's out-of-space arms --
   which this kernel turned into [printk] and which are therefore LIVE
   BEHAVIOUR -- this one really is a panic, so a contract that promises to
   RETURN has to refute it.  [sb_magic (sb_image ...) = FSMAGIC] is what
   does, and it is an image premise of exactly the same kind as the rest:
   mkfs writes the magic.  The panic credentials still ride, because the
   callees have their own panic arms.

   ---- ONE SLOT MORE THAN initlog GIVES BACK (a real composition fact) --

   [SpecInitlog] takes [bslots ((LOGBLOCKS + 2) + 2)] = 34 and returns
   only TWO: the other 32 are sealed into [log_state]'s pool inside the log
   spinlock, forever.  But [SpecIreclaim] needs THREE (iput's indirect arm,
   [iput_units]).  So fsinit cannot simply pass initlog's leftovers on, and
   it enters with [((LOGBLOCKS + 2) + 2 + 1)] = 35: one is held back across
   the [jal initlog] at +0x4e and rejoins initlog's two to make ireclaim's
   three.  fsinit's own bread at +0x10 borrows and returns one before any of
   that.  The postcondition therefore hands the caller [bslots 3], not
   [bslots 2].

   ---- WHAT COMPOSES, AND IN WHICH ORDER ------------------------------

   fsinit threads two PROVEN contracts and one of this stage's own:
   [SpecInitlog.wp_initlog_sconf] (whose whole struct-log bundle, era mirror
   and FsBlocks material ride straight through untouched) and
   [SpecIreclaim.wp_ireclaim_sconf].  Note the ORDER is load-bearing:
   initlog is what PRODUCES [log_ctx icfg_log bn fsc_fs fsc_cov fsc_logst dev], and
   ireclaim CONSUMES it (begin_op / end_op / iput).  So the log context does
   not cross this contract's boundary as an input at all -- it is born at
   +0x4e and handed to the caller at the end.

   ---- THE LOG'S GNAMES ARE [icfg_log]'s, NOT AN EXISTENTIAL -----------

   [initlog] is now an [_at] form (claude-notes/projects/fs-cfg-boot.md
   staging step 1): it FILLS a [log_names] it is handed instead of minting
   one, so what crosses this boundary in is [LogDefs.log_free_tok] -- the
   era fupd's receipt for the four gnames -- and what crosses out is
   [log_ctx] AT THOSE NAMES.  Here they are BAKED at [icfg_log], the
   configuration record's own field, for one reason: this contract's post is
   what the seal site turns into [FsReady.fs_ready], whose log conjunct is
   spelled [log_ctx icfg_log fsc_bio fsc_fs fsc_cov fsc_logst icfg_dev].  An
   existential [∃ γ] could never be shown equal to the ambient field
   (fs-ghost-state.md §7d, and IcacheRef.v's own §G.14/§G.16 note that a tie
   carried in a body existential admits no agreement with a consumer's γ).
   [wp_initlog_sconf] itself stays general in γ; the baking happens exactly
   here, one level below the seal.  The boot kit is what delivers
   [log_free_tok icfg_log] to forkret's first arm ([FirstTok.first_tok]'s
   widened left disjunct, fs-cfg-boot.md "Transport").

   fsinit is single-threaded boot context, it SLEEPS (bread, and everything
   under initlog and ireclaim), so it threads the full running-process bundle
   and takes the parking premise.  It enters and returns at noff 0.        *)

(* SpecVmfault.v -- the public interface of Vmfault, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   vmfault(pagetable, psz, va, read) is the lazy-allocation page-fault
   handler: below [psz] and unmapped, it kallocs a page, zeroes it, and maps
   it PTE_W|PTE_U|PTE_R at PGROUNDDOWN(va); anything else returns 0.

   *** IT NO LONGER CONFLATES THE TABLE IT IS GIVEN WITH THE RUNNING
   PROCESS'S. ***  xv6 `4f2fc8b` made both halves of the old conflation go
   away: the size arrives as an ARGUMENT instead of being read from
   `myproc()->sz`, and the [mappages] goes into [pagetable] rather than
   `myproc()->pagetable`.  vmfault now touches NEITHER proc cell, so this
   contract takes neither -- [p_sz p ↦₈{dqs} szv] and
   [p_pagetable p ↦₈{dqp} …] are gone, and with them the [dqs]/[dqp]
   parameters.  [szv] is simply the a1 register value.

   THAT IS THE FIRST OF kexec's THREE UPSTREAM BLOCKERS, RETIRED
   (claude-notes/projects/kexec.md).  copyout's contract had to assume its
   destination table WAS the running process's, because the vmfault beneath it
   mapped into `p->pagetable` whatever table it was handed.  kexec cannot
   satisfy that: it copies the argv strings into the NEW table while still
   running on the old one.  With vmfault honest about which table it maps
   into, copyout can be stated over an arbitrary [proc_pt P], and kexec can
   use it.

   THE CONTRACT IS STATED AT THE [proc_pt] ALTITUDE: vmfault PRESERVES the
   valid-user-page-table predicate of the table it operates on.  On failure
   the caller gets [proc_pt P] back unchanged (the tree may have grown
   interior nodes -- invisible, [pt_frame] is existential); on success it
   gets [proc_pt (uptd_insert P (svpn_of va0) r)]: the SAME predicate with
   the user map grown by exactly one entry -- the kalloc page [r] as a
   user-RW leaf -- whose well-formedness ([proc_pt_wf]: upt_map_wf,
   upt_acc_wf, um_pages_valid) is re-established inside, and whose page
   ownership has moved from kalloc's [page_own] into [proc_pt_own].

   The new page's ZEROED contents are deliberately not exposed: [proc_pt]
   owns pages at existential bytes (the user-safety altitude).

   Steady-state kalloc tier: [kalloc_env γa None is persistent (sealed
   count witness), so it is taken once and not returned; kalloc may fail
   nondeterministically, which is folded into the failure arm.

   [uint szv <= 2^38] is the one fact the caller must know about p->sz
   (MAXVA); where the canonical sz well-formedness lives is settled by the
   usertrap/sbrk work (see claude-notes/completed/vmfault.md). *)

   ---- STATUS -----------------------------------------------------------

   PROVEN HERE: the frame algebra, [kxc_prologue] (+0x000..+0x01c),
   [kxc_exit_m1] (the shared -1 exit at +0x072), the seam [kxc_at_a2], and
   [kxc_a1] -- +0x000 .. +0x030 INCLUDING the namei-null tail at +0x088,
   which closes kexec's own failure arm.  No [admit] / [Admitted] / [Axiom].

   NOT YET WRITTEN: [kxc_a2] (+0x032 .. +0x08e, owning the +0x064 tail) and
   [kxc_phaseA].  Everything they need that is not mechanical is proved
   below: [kxc_slot6_sp] (496(sp), for the s4 spill and its reload),
   [kxc_elf_acc] (the elf buffer borrowed as 64 NAMED bytes for readi and
   given back), [kxc_word4_of_named] / [kxc_named_of_word4] (the [lw] at
   +0x054), [kxc_seq_split_4], and [kxc_exit_m1] itself.

   TWO THINGS THAT MAKE [kxc_a2] SMALLER THAN IT LOOKS, and both are worth
   knowing before writing it:

   * NEITHER COMPARISON NEEDS BIT-LEVEL REASONING.  The [bne a0,64] at
     +0x050 and the [beq a4,a5] at +0x060 are BLIND case splits: both arms
     are handled (fall through to +0x090, or take the +0x064 tail), and
     neither seam has to say WHY.  In particular the +0x090 state does NOT
     need [ElfEnc.eh_magic_ok] -- kexec's contract says nothing about the
     file being a valid ELF, so nothing downstream consumes it -- and it
     does not need [tot = 64] either, because the buffer's contents are
     existential at every seam anyway.  Splitting on
     [destruct (eq_vec ...) eqn:E] and using the fall/taken leaf pair is the
     whole of it.
   * THE OPEN INODE TRAVELS AS ONE BUNDLE (kexec.md convention 4): what
     ilock produces and iunlockput consumes is [sleeplocked], [sl_pid],
     [ic_deposit], the two 1/2 identity cells, [i_valid], [ic_loaded] and
     the retained [inode_ref_short].  readi peels [ic_loaded] into
     [inode_meta] / [inode_map] / [inode_blocks] and hands them back
     LITERALLY unchanged, so the re-assembly re-uses the pure conjuncts
     verbatim (ProofFileread.v ~:1995).

   ---- WHAT TO DO FIRST IN EVERY PHASE LEMMA (adopted; B, C and D too) ----

   PIN [b = eb] BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE, with [kxc_sie_b_agree] below
   (ProofFileclose's / ProofIput's [sie_b_agree], verbatim):

       iDestruct (kxc_sie_b_agree m 0%nat K eb b pj C with "Hcg Hcnt") as %Ho.
       cbn in Ho. subst b.

   [sie_cap_gpr]'s SIE eighth and [cpu_own]'s [cpu_hart] are two
   presentations of the same bit, so at [n = 0] this reads [b = eb] straight
   off the precondition.  The deleted [eb = true ->] premise used to pin the
   pair to the literal on top of that; NOTHING PINS IT ANY MORE, and the
   whole phase runs at the free [eb].  It is not a convenience: every parking
   callee (namei, ilock, readi, end_op) publishes [wp_next TRUE], and
   [WpNext.wp_next_chain] cannot produce the [pj = zero_reg] disjunct from a
   SYMBOLIC [b] -- so without this step the very first [cpu_own_transport]
   after namei is unprovable.

   AND EVERY PHASE-LEMMA CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true], NOT [b].  [kxc_a1],
   [kxc_a2] and [kxc_phaseA] each relay kexec's own exit and a fall-through
   seam across namei / ilock / readi / end_op, all of which park; with
   [eb = true] forced the two spellings coincided, and with [eb] free only
   [true] is provable (eb-generic-sweep.md, "A PARK'S CROSSING IS THE LITERAL
   [true]").  The complement [trap_csrs_ext KT1 eb] / [cpu_claim_ext eb pj]
   is THREADED in and out of every one of them -- never framed across a call
   -- and rides [trap_csrs_ext_transport] / [cpu_claim_ext_transport] beside
   each [cpu_own_transport].  The two families sit at DIFFERENT source harts
   wherever a callee returns [cpu_own] but not the pair (myproc here).

   ---- ESCALATION: [ProcInv.cwd_ref] AND [SpecNamei] ARE AT DIFFERENT
        [icacheG] INSTANCES ------------------------------------------------

   [FileInvDefs.fileG] BUNDLES [icacheG] and [icfg] as field instances
   ([file_icacheG ::], [file_icfg ::]).  So a context that binds BOTH
   [!fileG Σ] and a standalone [!icacheG Σ] / [ICFG : icfg] -- which is
   exactly what SpecNamei.v:90-93 does, and what KexecDefs.v copied -- has
   TWO [icacheG]s, and durable-notes.md's second typeclass trap is live:

     * [ProcInv.cwd_ref] (ProcInv.v:613) elaborates its [inode_held] through
       [fileG] (ProcInv's own Context has no standalone [icacheG]);
     * [SpecNamei]'s [inode_held cwdv] premise elaborates through the
       standalone one.

   The two print IDENTICALLY and do not unify: machine-checked, the wand
   [cwd_ref v -∗ inode_held v] fails with "iFrame: cannot frame (cwd_ref v)"
   in a context binding both, and closes by [iIntros "$"] in a context
   binding only [fileG].  kexec is the FIRST caller to hand a process's
   working-directory reference to namei, which is why this has never fired.

   THE FIX IS SpecNamei.v's (and then SpecNamex / SpecNameiparent /
   KexecDefs, and any Spec in that chain that binds both): DROP the
   standalone [ICFG : icfg, !icacheG Σ] and let [!fileG Σ] supply them --
   durable-notes' recorded remedy, and the same edit the kfork chain and
   fileread already took.  It changes the [Module Type] binder lists, so it
   is a Spec-level change and not this file's to make.

   WHAT THIS FILE DOES INSTEAD, and why it is exactly the post-fix shape:
   the two proof Sections below bind [!fileG Σ] and NOT [!icacheG Σ] /
   [ICFG].  Every [icacheG] in sight is then [file_icacheG], [cwd_ref]
   matches [inode_held], and the callee contracts (whose Module Type
   Parameters quantify over ALL [icacheG]) are instantiated at that one.
   So [kxc_a1] is proved TODAY and will need no edit once the Specs are
   fixed.  What CANNOT be built until they are is the capstone: discharging
   [KEXEC]'s Parameter requires the body at an ARBITRARY standalone
   [icacheG], and at a mismatched one kexec's frame is not merely
   unprovable but incoherent -- it asks for FS invariants at one icache and
   a process whose cwd reference is at another.

   ---- THE SEAM, AND HOW IT DIFFERS FROM THE BRIEF ------------------------

   [kxc_at_a2] carries the frame's slots 14..63 as ONE [stack_own] chunk
   rather than as the three pre-made [bytes_own] carves.  That is a
   deliberate simplification and it is the better currency at a block
   boundary: the epilogue ([ProofKexecParts.kxc_epi_frame], through
   [kxc_frame]) wants [stack_own (pa_stk sp0 13) 55] BACK, so a seam stated
   in bytes would have to be re-slotted at every exit -- and re-slotting
   needs the per-slot alignment facts, which a byte run does not carry.
   Whichever half wants a buffer carves it itself, at the one place it is
   used, with [ProofKexecParts.kxc_slots_elf] / [kxc_slots_ph] /
   [kxc_slots_ustack] over [kxc_slots_asc] below.  Nothing is lost: the
   chunk determines the three carves and they do not determine it.

   ---- WHAT MOVED OUT ---------------------------------------------------

   The frame/seam algebra and the two shared bottom blocks ([kxc_exit_m1],
   [kxc_bad64], and the icache accessors they use) now live in
   ProofKexecTail.v, because ProofKexecB.v needs them and requiring THIS file
   to get them put the two proofs in series in the build.  Phase A opens that
   functor as [T] below and is otherwise unchanged.  See ProofKexecTail.v's

    (* ---- THE HEADER ORACLE (N-5.2B) ------------------------------------
       ONE ghost step, fired at the instant ilock's payload is open and
       before readi runs on it: the client is handed the locked inode's
       ERA LEG ([IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded]'s last conjunct, at the inum the
       +0x032 seam named) together with the payload's own [inode_ok] as a
       pure premise, and must give the leg back unchanged together with
       whatever it wanted to claim about the file's bytes.  An intact
       redeem is a READ, so the leg is returned identical and the payload
       re-packs at the very same [data] -- which is why readi's landed post
       still relates its output to it and readi's contract does not move
       (D-52d).
         A landed caller instantiates [HD := None] and discharges this with
       [iIntros; iModIntro; iFrame].
         THE BYTE RIDE IS GONE (THE DVIEW RETIREMENT, 2026-08-30).  The
       oracle used to be handed [fv_ride] beside the leg; that ghost had no
       tie to gamma-top outside the payload, which is why the widening of
       2026-08-29 put the leg here in the first place -- and the leg is what
       a verdict about the file's bytes actually reads, off the authority's
       row.  Nothing above [ProofKexec.v] moves: [KexecDefs]'s and
       [KexecOkQ]'s statements are untouched. ---- *)

    (* ---- THE HEADER ORACLE (N-5.2B) ------------------------------------
       ONE ghost step, fired at the instant ilock's payload is open and
       before readi runs on it: the client is handed the locked inode's
       ERA LEG ([IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded]'s last conjunct, at the inum the
       +0x032 seam named) together with the payload's own [inode_ok] as a
       pure premise, and must give the leg back unchanged together with
       whatever it wanted to claim about the file's bytes.  An intact
       redeem is a READ, so the leg is returned identical and the payload
       re-packs at the very same [data] -- which is why readi's landed post
       still relates its output to it and readi's contract does not move
       (D-52d).
         A landed caller instantiates [HD := None] and discharges this with
       [iIntros; iModIntro; iFrame].
         THE BYTE RIDE IS GONE (THE DVIEW RETIREMENT, 2026-08-30).  The
       oracle used to be handed [fv_ride] beside the leg; that ghost had no
       tie to gamma-top outside the payload, which is why the widening of
       2026-08-29 put the leg here in the first place -- and the leg is what
       a verdict about the file's bytes actually reads, off the authority's
       row.  Nothing above [ProofKexec.v] moves: [KexecDefs]'s and
       [KexecOkQ]'s statements are untouched. ---- *)

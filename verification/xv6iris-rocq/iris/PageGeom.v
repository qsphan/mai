(* PageGeom.v -- the PURE geometry of a kalloc page, extracted out of
   KallocInv.v so that files BELOW the lock/kalloc layer can name it.

   Everything here is a statement about an address (or a physical page
   number), with no ghost state and no Iris resources; it was all sitting
   inside KallocInv's [Section Kalloc] using none of that section's
   context.  KallocInv.v [Require Export]s this file, so every existing
   consumer of [page_valid] / [nullp] / [page_in_range_addr_is_kdata] is
   unaffected.

   WHY IT HAD TO MOVE.  [PtTree.pt_node_claim] -- the persistent per-node
   identity claim carried inside [pt_page_own] -- now records that a page
   TABLE node's page is a kalloc page ([page_valid (page_base b)]), which
   is what makes a page-table node re-freeable by freewalk.  PtTree.v sits
   far below WpLock (KallocInv's only heavy dependency), so the predicate
   had to come down to it rather than the file going up.  This is step 1
   of claude-notes/projects/proc-pagetable-ownership.md; the [page_own]
   family itself stays in KallocInv.v for now (it needs nothing lower).

   [page_base] also lives here rather than in ProcPtOwn.v, for the same
   reason: [pt_node_claim] has to spell the node page's base address. *)

(* A free page must be exactly what the real [kfree]/[kalloc] enforce: a
   4096-byte-aligned physical address within [end, PHYSTOP).  kfree PANICS
   otherwise (bounds + [pa % PGSIZE] checks), and kalloc only ever hands out
   pages it earlier took in, so the invariant must CARRY this validity to make
   kalloc's result re-freeable.  [PHYSTOP = 17 << 27].

   [kmem_lo] IS `end`, so it is DEFINED as the dumped symbol rather than
   transcribed from it.  As a literal it went stale on every image bump, and
   it failed NOT here but as a bare [lia] "Cannot find witness" in whichever
   consumer built first -- which reads as a broken proof and is not one.  The
   [ltac:(eval vm_compute)] is durable-notes.md's "compute the result ONCE
   into its own Definition" idiom: the body is a plain [Z] literal by the
   time anything downstream sees it, so every existing [unfold kmem_lo; lia]
   works unchanged -- which is the point.  Defining it as [KernelSyms.end_]
   directly does NOT work: [unfold kmem_lo] then leaves a constant [lia]
   cannot see through, and every one of the consumers has to learn to unfold
   a second name. *)

(* SpecPipewrite.v -- the public interface of pipewrite, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int pipewrite(struct pipe *pi, uint64 addr, int n);

   pipewrite copies up to [n] bytes from user address [addr] into the pipe,
   sleeping on [&pi->nwrite] while the pipe is full, and returns the number
   it copied -- or -1 if the read end closed or the process was killed while
   it waited.  @ KernelSyms.pipewrite = 0x8000449e, ~84 instructions, a
   112-byte frame; ra/s0..s5 saved in the prologue, s6..s10 SHRINK-WRAPPED
   onto the paths that need them.

   THE ALTITUDE.  Two objects meet here, and the spec sits at each one's
   public tier:

   - the PIPE, at the reference tier (PipeInv.v): [is_pipe] is persistent
     and [pipe_ref γp w q] -- at ANY positive fraction, and at the WRITE end
     ([w = true]) -- is the whole credential story.  It is what licenses
     acquire (and release, and the re-acquire inside sleep) on the pipe's
     cancellable lock, and it comes back untouched.  THE END IS PINNED (lane
     PQ-FLAG; it used to be either end): the byte queue's write link fires
     only at [ps_wo s = true], and a share of the WRITE end is the only thing
     that proves it -- see the premise below.  Everything pipewrite does to the pipe's fields happens
     under [pi->lock] and is invisible to the caller: the counters move, the
     queue coupling [pipe_count_ok] is preserved, and no contract weaker
     than a contents-indexed pipe could say more (see design/pipe.md).

   - the PROCESS, at the [proc_priv] altitude (the fetchaddr shape): the
     copies go through [pr->pagetable] and may fault pages in, so the block
     comes back with its user-table descriptor EXTENDED ([uptd_ext],
     transitive across the loop's copyin calls) and everything else intact.

   THE RETURN VALUE ([pipe_rw_ret]): -1, or some 0 <= i <= max 0 n.  The
   spec deliberately does not say WHICH: how many bytes fit is decided by
   concurrent readers, and whether a byte crossed at all is decided by
   copyin's own contract (an unmapped user page vmfault declines to back
   fails the copy).  A 0-or-negative [n] returns 0 -- but still takes the
   lock and still wakes the readers, exactly as the C does.

   INTERRUPT LEVEL IS PINNED AT 0: sleep parks through sched(), whose
   invariant demands noff = 1 -- the pipe lock and nothing else -- so
   pipewrite as a whole must be entered with no lock held.  The running-
   thread bundle ([own_ctx] + [sched_vc] + [procs_inv], SpecSleep.v's shape)
   is threaded through for the same reason.

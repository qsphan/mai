(* ProofCreateParts.v -- the pure and frame-level lemmas create's proof
   (fs-sysfile S5b) needs, landed ahead of the walk so that the walk is
   about the WP and nothing else.  Three groups, none of which touches a
   contract:

   (There was a fourth, the SIZE CAP AFTER A dirlink: [cr_size_cap]
   recovered [inode_ok]'s [di_size <= MAXFILE * BSIZE] from dirlink's "the
   append fits" premise, which the contract no longer has.  D₀-a repair 3b
   retired the premise as unsuppliable and [SpecDirlink] now RELAYS writei's
   own size-cap preservation, so the caller reads the cap off the
   postcondition and the arithmetic has no consumer.)

   (1) THE RECORD SURGERY.  create writes inode metadata with three
       halfword stores and nothing else -- [sh s5,70(s3)] / [sh s6,72(s3)]
       / [sh a4,74(s3)] at +0xb4 / +0xb8 / +0xbe (major, minor, nlink := 1),
       [sh zero,74(s3)] at +0x146 (the fail arm's nlink := 0), and
       [lhu/addiw/sh 74(s1)] at +0x134..+0x13a (the parent's nlink++).
       (The child is in s3 on the allocate half -- s3 is the register the
       prologue does NOT save; see SpecCreate.v's header.)
       Every one of them is [cr_setf], and the two facts a re-park of
       [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] needs -- [InodeLock.inode_ok] and
       [DirView.dir_ok] -- survive it for the same reason: neither
       predicate mentions major, minor or nlink.

   (2) THE TWO NAME LITERALS.  dirlink wants FOURTEEN bytes of name
       buffer; the "." and ".." arguments the auipc/addi pairs at
       +0xfc/+0x100 and +0x110/+0x114 compute are the rodata
       addresses 0x800075e8 and 0x800075f0, whose fourteen-byte windows
       run into their neighbours ("." 's window contains the ".." two
       bytes further on, and ".." 's contains the head of "unlink").
       [DirentEnc.bname] cuts at the first NUL, so both windows name the
       right string -- and both are PERSISTENT, out of [kernel_data], so
       create pays nothing to produce them and nothing to get them back.

   (3) THE FRAME AND LEDGER CONSTANTS, as arithmetic facts.

   Nothing here is create-specific in a way that would justify hiding it,
   but nothing else needs it yet either, so it lives beside the proof. *)

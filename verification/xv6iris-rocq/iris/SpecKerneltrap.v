(* SpecKerneltrap.v -- kerneltrap()'s interface, in TWO layers.

   [KERNELTRAP] (bottom of this file) is the real thing: the house-spec
   contract of the C function, discharged by ProofKerneltrap.v.

   [KERNELTRAP_RETURNS] (first) is the LEGACY round-trip contract kernelvec
   was written against and which [LinkKerneltrap.v] still supplies with an
   [Axiom].  It says nothing about what kerneltrap DOES -- only that it
   returns, preserving the caller's registers, saved-register stack windows,
   and S-mode config cells.  It exists only until [ProofKernelvec.v] is
   rewired onto [KERNELTRAP] (explicit-cpuid Stage 2: the handler contract
   has to start handing the handler the trap CSRs, [cpu_hart], a deeper
   stack carve and a hart-generic Loeb -- see
   claude-notes/completed/kerneltrap.md).  THE DAY THAT LANDS, DELETE
   [KERNELTRAP_RETURNS], [kv_cell], [kt_clobbered] AND [LinkKerneltrap.v]'s
   axiom; nothing else refers to them.

   Keeping two interfaces for one function is not the intended end state,
   and the removal condition above is the whole reason it is tolerable now:
   the new contract cannot be CONSUMED until the engine changes, and the old
   one cannot be deleted until it is.                                       *)

   @ KernelSyms.kerneltrap = 0x80002696, 40 instructions, a 48-byte frame
   (ra/s0/s1/s2/s3).

   THE CONTRACT IS STATED AT THE ONE CALL SITE THERE IS.  kerneltrap is
   reached only from kernelvec, i.e. only on a taken S-mode interrupt, so the
   precondition says so -- and that is what makes all THREE panic arms dead:

     panic("not from supervisor mode")  refuted by [Hspp]: the trapped
                                        mstatus has SPP = 1, which the
                                        handler contract's [trap_ms] says;
     panic("interrupts enabled")        refuted for free: the live SIE bit
                                        IS the ambient arm index
                                        ([IntrDefs.sie_arm_half_agree]), and
                                        a handler runs at [b = false];
     printk(...); panic("kerneltrap")   refuted by [Hsc]: scause is threaded
                                        at a PINNED value that devintr
                                        recognises.

   THE POINT OF DOING IT THIS WAY IS THE AXIOM LEDGER.  Closing the third arm
   with a panic instead would have been easy, but printk's general
   (non-panic) path is UNPROVEN, so a live edge to it would put
   [wp_printk_gen_sconf] in the cone -- proving kerneltrap would then trade
   one sanctioned assumed contract for another.  With [Hsc] the cone is
   devintr + myproc + yield + panic, all proven, and discharging this
   contract removes [Kerneltrap.kerneltrap_returns] with nothing taking its
   place.

   WHY [Hsc] IS DISCHARGEABLE AT THE CALL SITE (and why it needs no [mip]
   invariant): the dispatch set is [s_pending = s_mip_bits & mie & mideleg],
   masked by [mie] -- and this kernel writes [sie] exactly once, in start()
   (`w_sie(r_sie() | SIE_SEIE | SIE_STIE)`, bits 9 and 5), never writes
   [mie], and starts from 0.  So no cause but S-external and S-timer can ever
   be pending, which is exactly devintr's two.  See
   [claude-notes/completed/kerneltrap.md].

   HOW THE SPP FACT REACHES THE CHECK: [sret_bits], the ghost mirror of
   mstatus.SPP and SPIE (IntrDefs).  The check runs FOUR instructions after
   entry, and every instruction round-trips [sconf] through
   [wp_instr_s_sconf], whose [exists ms] destroys the identity of the
   mstatus -- so no fact ABOUT a named entry mstatus can survive, and no
   flavour of the bundle rescues it.  What survives is the ghost, threaded
   independently: the caller hands over the travelling half at ('1','1')
   (the trap came from S-mode with interrupts enabled), and agreement with
   the tie inside [sconf] recovers the fact at whatever mstatus the sstatus
   read names.

   BECAUSE OF THAT, THE POSTCONDITION IS ABSOLUTE, NOT RELATIVE.  The final
   [csrw sstatus] writes back the saved word, so the mstatus kerneltrap
   leaves has SPP = 1, SPIE = 1 and SIE = 0 outright -- there is no need to
   name an entry mstatus anywhere in the contract, and the precondition
   threads the PLAIN [sie_cap_gpr].  Only the postcondition uses the
   mstatus-exposing flavour, and only because [sret] is what reads those
   bits.

   The travelling half CROSSES THE PARK with the other trap CSRs: on the
   resuming hart it comes back at that hart's own values, and the final
   [csrw sstatus] re-pins it from the word held in s1 -- a register value,
   which migrates for free.

   THE CROSSING IS REAL: [wp_next true p].  kerneltrap yields on a timer
   interrupt when this cpu has a current process, so execution can resume on
   a DIFFERENT hart -- and [wp_next]'s second escape hatch collapses that
   exactly when [p = zero_reg], which is the same condition the C tests
   (`which_dev == 2 && myproc() != 0`).  The per-hart cells therefore come
   back at the RESUMING hart: sepc holds the epc kerneltrap put back, but
   scause and stval are that hart's own and their values are existential.

   [eb = false] THROUGHOUT, and it is not a convenience.  The trap cleared
   SIE, so yield's own acquire records intena = 0, sched carries that across
   the park, and the matching release does not turn interrupts back on --
   kernelvec's sret is what restores SIE from SPIE.  This is the one place in
   the tree that parks at [eb = false], and today's SpecYield/SpecSched
   demand [eb = true]; see the project note for the generalization that
   owes.                                                                    *)

(* kerneltrap's own frame is 6 slots; the deepest callee is devintr at
   [SpecDevintr.devintr_stack] = 40 (myproc wants 10, yield 20). *)
Notation kerneltrap_stack := (58%nat) (only parsing).
(* THE CHECK THAT KEEPS [IntrDefs.kv_frame_slots] HONEST.  That constant is
   the stack a trap may consume below the interrupted sp, and it has to cover
   kernelvec's own 32-slot frame PLUS this whole cone.  It is written as a
   literal there because this file sits above IntrDefs, so nothing would stop
   the two from drifting -- and drift is exactly the silent kind: growing
   kerneltrap's cone still compiles and only fails deep inside the handler
   proof, at a place that looks unrelated. *)

     the yield path it goes into the park and the dispatch payload's takes its
     place ([SpecYield]).  A caller gets back one about whichever hart it
     resumed on, and never has to know which case it was in.

     Why the caller needs it at all: kernelvec's [sret] flips SIE '0' -> '1',
     and that flip needs the [intr_res] quarter -- so a returning trap cannot
     re-enable interrupts without the handler resource in hand.  kernelvec can
     pay this premise; the handler spec inside it, at a LATER, is exactly its
     own Löb hypothesis, which is where the recursion in this cone is closed.

     IT IS THREADED, NOT PERSISTENT.  It used to be [intr_handler_avail], a
     duplicable credential -- but the persistence was per-hart and therefore
     bought nothing across the one boundary (the park) that mattered.  The

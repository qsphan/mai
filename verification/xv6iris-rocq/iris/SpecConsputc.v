(* SpecConsputc.v -- the public interface of Consputc, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void consputc(int c) {
       if (c == BACKSPACE) {
         uartputc_sync(0, '\b'); uartputc_sync(0, ' '); uartputc_sync(0, '\b');
       } else {
         uartputc_sync(0, c);
       }
     }

   consputc is the console's one-character output path, and the only thing the
   printk cone does to the UART.  Its contract is uartputc_sync's, LOOSENED on
   one axis: the number of bytes.  The two arms push a different number (three
   for a BACKSPACE, one otherwise), so a post naming a single byte would have to
   case-split on [c] -- and every caller above (printint, printk) would then have
   to carry that split all the way up through a format-string recursion, for no
   gain: nothing in the kernel depends on WHICH bytes reach the UART.  So the
   post says only that SOME byte list [cs] was appended to what this caller has
   provably sent, which is what "the character was printed" means at this
   altitude.

   THERE IS NO LONGER A SECOND PATH TO CHOOSE BETWEEN.  printk.c's two
   [volatile int] globals ([panicking], [panicked]) are deleted, so
   uartputc_sync has exactly one behaviour: it takes [tx_lock] around its
   poll/store pair.  Consequently this contract carries no flag cells and no
   [eq_vec]/[neq_vec] refutation premises, and it DOES carry what any spinlock
   caller carries -- [cpu_own] threaded net-zero (the acquire/release pair
   inside each uartputc_sync leaves the interrupt level as it found it), the
   transient-increment bound on [noff].  Acquire's "already holding" arm is
   refuted, so nothing panic-related is threaded.

   THE PORT IS THE CALLEE'S BUSINESS, NOT THIS CONTRACT'S.  XV6_REV 163d39b
   gives uartputc_sync a port index and consputc passes 0 at each of its four
   call sites, but the console IS port 0 and always was, so nothing a caller of
   consputc can observe moved: no binder, no premise and no postcondition
   conjunct here mentions a port.  What the bump does add is ONE premise --
   [SpecUartPutc.uart_base_word Uart0], the persistent .data word the callee
   LOADS its MMIO address out of.  It is not derivable from anything already
   here (the old driver spelled the address as a constant), so it has to be
   relayed; being persistent, a caller hands it over for free.

   THE TRANSMITTER IS NOT THREADED.  It is [tx_lock]'s resource
   ([UartTxInv.tx_res]), taken and given back inside each callee, so
   [uart_tx_own] appears nowhere; the caller brings only the persistent
   [UartTxInv.is_txlock γl γd] (which carries [uart_dlab_off] with it).  And
   because the lock is re-acquired PER BYTE -- three times on the BACKSPACE arm,
   with other harts free to interleave in between -- the caller's obligation
   is a CHAIN and not one shift over the message: [WpUart.out_chain Uart0
   (consputc_cs a00) Φ], one link per byte, because another hart's bytes
   really can land between two of ours (lane OUT-FUPD, F3).

   AND THAT IS WHY THE BYTES ARE A FUNCTION AND NO LONGER AN EXISTENTIAL.
   The receipt is retired, so the post's [∃ cs] with its pinned equation has
   nothing left to say; what the caller needs INSTEAD is to know, BEFORE the
   call, which bytes it is justifying -- so the arm's bytes are computed
   from the argument by [consputc_cs] below and the caller's chain is stated
   over them.  The post is the chain's payload [Φ].

   THIS CONTRACT IS THE CONSOLE'S ALONE.  consputc passes 0 at each of its
   four call sites (XV6_REV 163d39b), so the port here is [Uart0] and the
   chain is a real obligation; printk reaches the same store leaf through
   [SpecPrputc] at [Uart1], where it owes nothing. *)

(* consputc's own frame is 2 slots ([c.addi16sp sp,-16] at +0x00), over
   uartputc_sync's 18.  IT WAS 16: at 163d39b uartputc_sync keeps the port
   pointer, the lock pointer and the loaded base in callee-saved registers, so
   its own frame doubled (32 -> 64 bytes, 4 -> 8 slots) and every caller's

(* PipeNames.v -- the plain data of a pipe's ghost state: its five ghost
   names and the abstract STATE its byte queue is tracked at.  No Iris, no
   Sail: this sits below [Xv6Cameras] (which builds the queue's camera over
   [pipe_st]) and below [FdSlots] (whose [FdPipe] carries the names), so
   that a descriptor's state can name the pipe it is an end of.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/pipe.md, "The byte queue". *)

(* THE ABSTRACT STATE OF A PIPE: every byte ever written, in order; the
   read pointer -- [ws !! rp] is the next byte a read delivers -- and the
   two OPEN FLAGS, [struct pipe]'s [readopen] / [writeopen] as bools.  The
   flags are in the EXACT state so that a fragment holder knows, at every
   instant, whether the other end is still open -- which is what predicts
   an end-of-file ([pst_eof]) -- and so closing an end is a ghost step
   like writing a byte ([pst_close]), paid by the closer. *)

(* UkWaitCons.v -- THE CONSUMER TEST for wait at a real status pointer
   (lane RD-7).

   WHAT IT IS FOR.  [UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_wait_status] is the first wait
   leaf whose caller may pass a pointer, and the only way to see that the
   statement is USABLE is to spend it: a parent holding
   [ChildTok.child_tok] for the one child it forked calls wait at a buffer
   it owns, and comes back holding BOTH halves of what a reap answers --
   the payload its child's exit paid ([ChildTok.gen_pay]) and the four
   bytes of the status that payload is keyed at, in its own memory.
   Neither was stateable before: the null leaves copy nothing, and the
   window leaf excludes wait because a reap moves the children reading.

   THE TEST IS AT ONE CHILD, deliberately.  With [Sc = {[γc]}] the reaped
   generation is the caller's own by set arithmetic alone, so the test
   measures the INTERFACE and not a pid comparison the program would
   otherwise have to run (init's loop does run one --
   [UkInitMain]'s [beq] against the shell's pid -- and this leaf serves it
   just as well; what it needs from the answer is exactly what is taken
   here).

   WHAT THE -1 ARM COSTS.  It is handed back with the buffer and the token
   and NOTHING said about why.  The reason is precise and is the lane's
   one identified wall: [UserChildren.wait_why]'s first exit -- a zombie
   child was there and copyout could not place its status -- is guarded on
   the status pointer being NULL, so a caller that passes a real pointer
   buys the status word and pays the -1 arm's reason.  Refuting that exit
   needs kwait to publish copyout's own [~ UserPtTree.uva_wmapped]
   witness, the way consoleread's swallow arm publishes its own
   ([UkRunSys.uk_read_nofault] is the U-tier half, already built).  See
   claude-notes/design/user-proc.md. *)

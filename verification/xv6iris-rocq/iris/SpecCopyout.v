(* SpecCopyout.v -- the public interface of Copyout, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int copyout(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 dstva, char *src, uint64 len) {
       while (len > 0) {
         va0 = PGROUNDDOWN(dstva);
         if (va0 >= MAXVA) return -1;
         pa0 = walkaddr(pagetable, va0);
         if (pa0 == 0 && (pa0 = vmfault(pagetable, va0, 0)) == 0) return -1;
         pte = walk(pagetable, va0, 0);
         if (( *pte & PTE_W) == 0) return -1;   // no copyout over user text
         n = PGSIZE - (dstva - va0);  if (n > len) n = len;
         memmove((void * )(pa0 + (dstva - va0)), src, n);
         len -= n; src += n; dstva = va0 + PGSIZE;
       }
       return 0;
     }

   The mirror of SpecCopyin.v, and stated at the same [proc_pt] altitude:
   copyout PRESERVES the valid-user-page-table predicate and hands back a
   descriptor EXTENDING the one it was given, with every entry it gained
   below [p->sz] ([uptd_ext_sz szv]).  Read its header for why the two exits
   share one resource story, and for why the size bound is free.

   THE SOURCE BUFFER COMES BACK UNCHANGED ([src_bytes] on both sides) -- the
   one functional guarantee this contract makes, and the one a caller needs
   (it still owns, and can still read, what it asked to be copied out).

   WHAT THE USER PAGES END UP HOLDING is what the contract says, and it is
   an EQUATION.  [wp_copyout_sconf_mem] runs at [proc_ptm P (uint szv) M],
   the contents-indexed refinement of [proc_pt] (ProcPtOwn.v §5c), and its
   post pins the process's memory view at [umem_wr M dstva len src_bytes] --
   the given view with the source buffer written at [dstva + j].  It pins
   both what changed and what did not.  This is the ONLY contract copyout
   has: the ∃-[M] corollary every caller used to speak is GONE, because
   every caller now names the image it hands in.

   THE FAILURE ARM IS HONEST ABOUT THE PREFIX, AND THE PREFIX IS SHORT.
   copyout writes page by page and can fail on a later page (bad va, no
   backing, read-only leaf), so the -1 arm promises
   [umem_wr M dstva d src_bytes] for some [d], not [M].  But it promises
   [d < len], STRICTLY: a failure exits the loop with bytes still to go,
   so at least one requested byte did not land.  That is what a ONE-BYTE
   caller needs -- for [len = 1] it forces [d = 0], i.e. a failing
   one-byte copyout moved nothing -- and one-byte copyouts are what
   piperead's and consoleread's copy loops are made of, which is in turn
   what lets them say they wrote exactly as many bytes as they return.
   A caller that needs the all-or-nothing reading at a longer [len] still
   has to rule -1 out, which needs writable leaves -- see below.

   Note what the [PTE_W] test does NOT buy: [proc_ptm] is preserved
   whether or not the target leaf is writable.  The test is honoured as a
   third failure arm, not as a precondition -- so a caller need know
   nothing about which of its pages are read-only. *)

(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  copyout NO LONGER DEPENDS ON THE RUNNING PROCESS AT ALL.               *)
(* ===================================================================== *)
(* There used to be exactly ONE place where it did -- the [vmfault] in the
   loop that backs a page the walk did not find -- and it was load-bearing
   enough to shape this whole file.  vmfault read [p->sz] for its bound test
   and mapped into [p->pagetable], NOT into the table it was handed, so the
   [p_sz] / [p_pagetable] premises this contract carried were really the
   unstated claim "the table you are copying into IS the running process's".

   That claim was true of every caller except exec, which copies its argument
   strings into a table it has BUILT but not yet installed.  So the premise
   had been turned into a resource with two shapes selected by a ghost
   boolean [arm]: the process's own cells, or [co_mapped] -- "every byte the
   copy touches is already a valid user leaf", under which walkaddr never
   returns 0 and the vmfault call is dead.

   *** ALL OF THAT IS DELETED, because xv6 `4f2fc8b` fixed the conflation at
   the source. ***  vmfault now takes the size as an ARGUMENT and maps into
   the [pagetable] it was handed (SpecVmfault.v); copyout gained a matching
   [psz] parameter (a1, shifting dstva/src/len down to a2/a3/a4) and passes
   it straight down.  copyout therefore touches neither proc cell on any
   path, so there is no premise left to pay for and nothing for [arm] to
   select between: [co_license], [co_mapped], the [arm] index, the
   [COPYOUT_GEN] interface and the [dqs]/[dqp] parameters are all gone, and
   what remains is ONE contract over an arbitrary [proc_pt P].

   THIS RETIRES kexec's FIRST UPSTREAM BLOCKER (claude-notes/projects/
   kexec.md) -- and retires it more cheaply than the [arm] route did.  kexec
   no longer has to establish [co_mapped] over its destination range (a
   per-byte "already a valid user leaf" obligation, which is why phase C was
   going to need it); it just passes the new image's size in a1.  A caller
   that wants the fault path dead outright passes [szv := 0]: vmfault's
   [va >= psz] test then fires on every va, and [uptd_ext_sz 0 P P'] reads
   back [P' = P].  The ghost boolean has become an ordinary argument.

   WHAT NONE OF THIS BUYS: success.  The [va0 >= MAXVA] test and the [PTE_W]
   test are still live, so the -1 arm remains reachable and the
   postcondition still offers both.  That is the honest reading -- a caller
   that needs to rule -1 out must know its leaves are writable, and no
   caller in the tree does. *)

(* THE ONE CONTRACT.  Every caller -- either_copyout, piperead, kwait, readi,
   sys_pipe, and now kexec -- speaks this one; see ProofCopyout.v. *)
(* THE SOURCE RIDES THE CALLER'S FRACTION [dqsrc]; THE DESTINATION PAGE TABLE
   STAYS WHOLE.  The rule is the tree's: a byte run the callee only READS takes
   the caller's dfrac, a run it WRITES stays at full ownership.  copyout loads
   from [src] and stores through the user table, so the source is read-only to
   it and [proc_pt P] -- which the walk may extend and the memmove does write
   through -- is not.  The consumer is kexec: forkret calls
   [kexec("/init", (char *[]){"/init", 0})], so the same .rodata literal is
   both the path and argv[0], and kexec cannot hand copyout full ownership of
   an argument string it holds only fractionally.  Callers that do own their
   buffer outright (sys_pipe, piperead, kwait, filestat, either_copyout) pass
   [DfracOwn 1] and see no change. *)
(* THE BUFFER CARRIES ITS OWN TIER [ktb], below the hart's regime [KT1].
   It is FORCED and it is the same two-tier shape [WpSconfMem]'s merged
   leaves have: this function's kernel buffer is a FRAME local at [KT1] for
   one caller and a KT0 page/bio window for the next, and one shared tier
   cannot state both.  See SpecMemmove.v's note. *)
(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  THE MEMORY-INDEXED CONTRACT.                                          *)
(* ===================================================================== *)
(* Same function, same frame, same failure arms -- the only difference is
   that the process's memory view [M] is NAMED on the way in and pinned on
   the way out.  [umem_wr M dstva n src_bytes] (UserPtTree.v) is [M] with
   [src_bytes j] written at user va [uint (add_vec_int dstva j)] for every
   [j < n]; it is keyed by the 64-bit va rather than by an integer base
   precisely so this contract need not promise that [dstva + len] does not
   wrap.  A caller that knows it does not wrap reads individual bytes back
   out with [umem_wr_lookup_in], and reads untouched bytes back out with
   [umem_wr_lookup_out].

   [vmfault] preserves [M] (SpecVmfault.v), which is what makes this
   statement as simple as it is: the lazily-backed zero pages are already
   IN [M], so backing one on the fault path moves no byte, and the only
   thing that ever moves [M] here is the memmove. *)
(* WHAT THE CALL DID TO THE PROCESS'S MEMORY, as one predicate over the
   returned [a0] and the returned view.  It subsumes the plain
   "returns 0 or -1" of [wp_copyout_sconf_body]: each arm names the value. *)
(* ...AND WHEN IT FAILS, WHY (app-echo.md, lane CONS-SWALLOW, W1).  The -1
   arm used to be unconditional, which made "the byte never reached the
   process" unrefutable by any caller.  It is not unconditional: the loop
   gives up exactly where the destination page is one it cannot copy to --
   walkaddr answered 0 on the round's table and vmfault could not back the
   page, or the re-walk's leaf has PTE_W clear -- and every one of those
   verdicts says [~ uva_wmapped] at the failing address.  Stated at the
   ENTRY table [P]: the round's table only GREW ([uptd_ext_sz]), and a byte
   this table can take the grown one can take too
   ([UserPtTree.uva_wmapped_mono]), so the entry form is the weaker and the
   one a caller can use.  Keyed by the 64-bit va like the image equation
   beside it, so this arm promises nothing about wrap either. *)

(* HartMemRun.v -- THE MEMORY-INCLUSIVE FUNCTIONAL WALKER, and its one swp
   rule (claude-notes/projects/main-cycle-port.md, "THE USER TIER").

   [HartSpan.hfrun] walks a stretch of the model whose every REGISTER access
   is inside a footprint, refusing anything else -- in particular every
   memory access, so a memory event is always a separate node rule.  That is
   the right cut for the kernel's instruction leaves, where the memory
   footprint is a handful of owned words.  It is the wrong cut for the USER
   TIER: there the machine executes ARBITRARY user code, and the exec facts
   the tier already has ([UserTotalU], [UserMemArms], ...) are whole-cycle
   facts at a symbolic state -- but a user hart OWNS everything its cycle can
   touch (all its registers in [user_regs], every mapped page in
   [user_pt_inv]), so nothing another hart does can reach the cycle.  What
   the old sigma-callback rule got for free must be recovered as ownership,
   and this walker is how: it carries the owned bytes as a MAP and lets a
   RAM read/write in the footprint step like a register.

   [hmrun n D Drw rs mm m = Some (x, rs', mm')]: run [m] for [n] nodes over
   the register file [rs] (reads in [D], writes in [Drw], as [hfrun]) and the
   OWNED byte map [mm] (a RAM read must find every byte of its footprint in
   [mm] and returns their little-endian value; a RAM write must find its
   footprint in [dom mm] and updates them; MMIO is refused, and so is
   everything [hfrun] refuses).  The walker does not know about the
   reservation (design §3a): an exclusive read and a conditional write step
   like a plain read and write, and [swp_hmrun] threads the hart's
   [resv_frag] itself.

   [swp_hmrun]: the frames and the owned bytes in, the walker's landing file
   and byte map out -- proved ONCE by induction on the fuel from the node
   rules ([HartSpan] for the register/silent nodes, [HartEvents] for the
   memory nodes), exactly as [HartSpanChar.swp_hfrun] is proved for [hfrun].

   [hmrun_of_exec] (below, stated; the certificate side): every whole-cycle
   [exec] fact the user tier has becomes a walker fact under a FOOTPRINT
   CERTIFICATE [goodmb] -- [WpDecodeBridge.goodb] with the memory accesses
   admitted when their footprint is inside the owned bytes.

   AND AT [mm := ∅] THIS FILE IS ALSO THE REGISTER-WRITE ENGINE THE TREE
   LACKED.  [goodb] refuses every [RegWrite] and [HartGoodb.hval_of_goodb]
   demands [exec m dst = Some (x, dst)] -- the SAME state -- so no stretch
   that writes a register can go through them.  [goodmb] takes register
   writes ([andb (Dw r) ...]) and [hmrun_of_exec] takes [exec m s = Some
   (x, s')] with [s' <> s], while [bytes_own ∅ = emp] and [∅ ⊆ s.(mem)]
   cost nothing.  So

     [swp_hmrun_of_exec ... (mm := ∅)] IS THE REGISTER-WRITING ANALOGUE OF
     [HartGoodb.hval_of_goodb],

   which is what the trap towers (U-mode and S-mode), MRET's walk and
   [reset_elp] want.  Section 4b is the toolkit for exactly that shape. *)

   from a raw [↦ₚ]: the PLAIN data load owes [Mobl_ram_plain], which a flat
   cell cannot give, and the STORE owes the append's four ghost steps,
   which need the timestamp elements.  So the map's members carry their
   ledger residue.

   exactly like the tier, so the ~60 pass-through call sites are textually
   unchanged.  What is NOT free is [own_context cur_ctx] on [swp_hmrun]:
   the token is exclusive, so it cannot be folded into [bytes_own] (which
   would duplicate it under [bytes_own (mm1 ∪ mm2)]) and has to be a

  (* THE COMPOSITE RULE the user tier calls: a whole-cycle [exec] fact, a
     footprint certificate for it, and the hart's own resources in -- the
     [swp] out.  The certificate's footprints [Dr]/[Dw] have to land inside
     the frames the caller holds, and the caller's file [rs] need only AGREE
     with the exec fact's state on those frames: the walk consults the file
     only inside its read footprint, so it lands the same modulo agreement
     ([hmrun_agree]), exactly as [HartGoodb.hval_of_goodb] handles the
     decode catalogue's reference state.

     The post map is EXISTENTIAL and pinned by [dom mm' = dom mm]: that is
     all a chained call needs, since [goodmb] consults the map only through
     [bytes_owned], i.e. only through its domain ([goodmb_dom]).  A caller
     that wants the map NAMED has it -- it is [mm_after m s mm]; compose
     [hmrun_of_exec_after] with [swp_hmrun] directly, as this proof does. *)

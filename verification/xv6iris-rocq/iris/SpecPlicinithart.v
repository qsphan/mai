(* SpecPlicinithart.v -- the public interface of plicinithart, stated
   independently of its proof.  [plicinithart] (xv6-riscv/kernel/plic.c) enables
   BOTH UARTs' and the VIRTIO interrupt for THIS hart's S-mode context and
   drops its priority threshold to 0:

       ...epilogue...

   The two stores are S-mode 32-bit MMIO writes through the kernel page table's
   PLIC identity mapping.

   WHY THIS SPEC OWNS NO PLIC STATE.  plicinithart runs CONCURRENTLY on every
   hart: no hart can own the PLIC state across its two writes, because the
   others are writing their own contexts at the same time.  So the shared
   [plic_frag] half stays in the device invariant [dev_inv] (WpUart.v) and this
   spec takes that invariant -- persistent, hence shareable -- instead.  Each
   store opens it, writes, and closes it.  (This is the same reason [plicinit],
   which hart 0 does run alone at boot, still cannot hold the fragment raw: the
   PLIC gateway latches whenever an irq line is up.)

   What the caller gets back is therefore not this hart's PLIC context but the
   invariant itself: the kernel's PLIC plan [plic_ok] (PlicPlan.v) still holds.
   That plan is deliberately weak -- per-hart thresholds are unconstrained and a
   hart's enable word may only name sources the machine has -- precisely so that
   a hart can re-establish it from its own two writes, knowing nothing about
   what the other harts wrote.  Even so the spec is not vacuous: the proof must
   show both addresses decode to real PLIC context registers for this hart
   ([plic_write] returns [Some]), which is what pins the precondition
   [bv_unsigned tp < dev_ncpu].

   Requires only the definitional layer + SpecCpuid (for [cpuid_ret]) -- never a
   whole-function proof file. *)

(* INTERRUPTS MUST BE DISABLED.  plicinithart's very first instruction is an
   unbracketed [jal cpuid] -- there is no push_off/pop_off anywhere in its
   body -- and [cpuid]'s own contract (SpecCpuid.v) is [b = false]-ONLY (it
   reads [tp] mid-body; see the porting guide, "A function that READS tp
   mid-body must be stated at b = false"). A caller-supplied [b] cannot meet
   that precondition, so plicinithart itself can only be called with
   interrupts already off. This holds at every real call site: plicinithart
   runs from main(), on every hart, strictly before scheduler()'s
   [intr_on()] -- interrupts (SSTATUS.SIE) are never turned on during boot
   (start()/main() only touch the [sie] CSR's per-source mask bits, not the
   global enable) -- see
   claude-notes/projects/explicit-cpuid-porting-guide.md, and
   SpecTrapinithart.v / SpecCpuid.v for the identical boot-only shape. So the
   contract is stated at the literal index [false] rather than a generic
   [b], with no [wp_next] wrapper (it would collapse via [wp_next_off]
   anyway, since the hart cannot move). *)

(* App.v -- APPLICATIONS: the record, and the whole-system theorem at one.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/applications.md and the
   application-side sections of claude-notes/projects/app-echo.md (the
   "app-instances.md" this header used to cite does not exist; its round
   and section numbers survive below as cross-references into those two).
   An application is a collection of user programs plus what it
   claims -- a FIXED PART (section 6 ruling 1: a [Type] of its own, born
   once by its birth step and carried by the machine's record for the
   whole run), a predicate on the abstract file-system state's VIEW at the
   fixed part and at its own per-instance ghost names ([AppCfg.appcfg]'s
   data), what it is lent at every boot about the durable state, a trace
   ledger, and a pure conclusion.  The DATA is the record [xv6_app]; the
   OBLIGATIONS are the premises of [xv6_app_adequacy], stated exactly as
   [SystemAdequacy.xv6_power_adequacy_gen] states them (at the raw gnames
   and the fixed part, the [boot_fixedGS] literal), so that an application
   that can pay some and not others is a DEFINITION and never a vacuous
   theorem.

   THE GENERIC APPLICATION [app_triv] -- user space does anything, the
   abstract state is anything, the kernel stays correct -- pays every
   obligation trivially; [SystemAdequacy.xv6_trace_adequacy] and its
   siblings are [xv6_power_adequacy_gen] at exactly its data.  The first
   non-trivial application is [AppEcho.v]; what it still owes is
   claude-notes/projects/app-echo.md.

   THE OBLIGATIONS ARE SIX FAMILIES, and that is all of them: [Hbirth],
   [Happ_xfer], [Happ_init], [Hinit_boot], the trace ledger's ([HR0],
   [HRt], [Hpow], [Htx], [Hrx]) and [Hphi].  There is no parked license:
   the BLANKET PROMISE that the claim survives every one-row move of the
   map is gone, because the AU fires' steps come out of the PROCESS's own
   deposit ([UexecSG.sbundle_at]); and there is no supply either -- the
   kernel mints no user-execution slot, so what the application owes about
   user execution is the FIRST PROCESS'S EXEC BUNDLE and nothing else.

   HOW THE PIECES MEET THE THEOREM.
   - [app_fixed]/[app_cl] are the BIRTH STEP: [Hbirth] runs FIRST in
     [RiscvAdequacy.riscv_power_adequacy], before the crash slot, and the
     value it yields is [RiscvPtsto.riscv_client] of every era's record.
   - [app_names]/[app_pred] become the era's [AppCfg.appcfg]:
     [SystemAdequacy.xv6_boot_era] builds the record
     [MkAppcfg _ (app_pred c) r] -- the fixed part APPLIED -- at the
     running instance [r] the boot obligation witnesses and threads it to
     the era mint ([FsCfgSnap.fs_cfg_alloc_snap]), which founds the
     application's invariant ([AppInv.app_inv]: its half of the abstract
     map's authority beside its claim) at the founded map's view.  The
     claim IS the application's DURABLE one (app-instances.md round C):
     the crash slot is the composite [SystemAdequacy.xv6_slot] -- the file
     system's record beside the application's claim at the same snapshot
     name ([AppDur.app_dur_raw]) -- the PowerOn arm clones it onto the
     lend by the TRANSPORT [Happ_xfer], and the boot founds the era from
     the lent claim.  Era 0's claim is [Happ_init], at the image's state.
   - [Hinit_boot] is the FIRST PROCESS'S EXEC BUNDLE
     ([InitBoot.init_boot_bundle]): kexec's caller-side bundle at "/init",
     whose SLOT PIECE answers at the key kexec builds.  forkret's boot arm
     runs that kexec between the first park and the first resume, so no
     slot the kernel could have minted survives it -- which is why this,
     and not a supply, is what the application owes about user execution.
     The generic application discharges it from the trivial mint
     ([SystemAdequacy.init_boot_of_triv]); a constraining application
     discharges it from its own pinned bundle at "/init".  Either way it
     is a discharged premise, not a gap (see [SystemAdequacy]'s
     [Hinit_boot]).
   - [app_R c] is the trace slot's resource at the fixed part; [HR0]
     RECEIVES the birth step's yield ([obs_ledger_at_alloc_cl]) -- for the
     echo application, its taint counter at 0; the power step and the two
     UART-arm wands are [xv6_trace_adequacy]'s, quantified over the fixed
     part (the record's [riscv_client] is it by iota at the boot).
   - [app_phi] is read at the end of the run by [Hphi], which holds the
     crash predicate and the ledger side by side -- which is where an
     application relates "the input kept the discipline" (its counter at
     0) to "the durable state is still what it claims" (the crash
     predicate's arm of the disjunction; lane L4). *)

  (* THE APPLICATION'S CONSOLE INTERFACE, as ONE field (redesign R4), and
     the machine's [RiscvPtsto.riscvF_app_iface] is set from it.  Its three
     components, spelled as projections below:

     [app_tag] -- THE INPUT TAG (app-echo.md lane L5): what the application
     claims of a byte the environment pushed, at the history it arrived at.
     PERSISTENT, because the UART's receive column keeps one per queued byte
     and every reader copies it out.

     [app_kill] -- THE KILL CREDENTIAL (lane KILL-PAY, K1): what the
     application charges for a kill.  A kill is legal, and every party it
     touches -- the killer, the killed slot's public payload, the trap that
     observes [p->killed], the -1 the process exits with, the -1 a console
     read returns -- is handed this, so a verified continuation goes GENERIC
     where a kill could have happened instead of being refuted.  PERSISTENT
     and BOUGHT BY THE SUPPLY ([al_kill]), which is what lets the kernel
     charge the kill price at a trap it cannot rule out without charging any
     verified program.  For echo it is the TAINT; [True] for an application
     that puts no price on a kill.

     [app_cons] -- THE CONSOLE CLAIM (redesign R2/R3): what the application
     claims of the whole console boundary -- the bytes the UART has
     accepted, the accepted-input log, what a process has been given, and
     the arm consoleintr has in progress.  Read against an input-history
     prefix of the run.  A RESOURCE and not a [Prop], because a pure
     predicate cannot say WHO may write and the console echo's shift is then
     unprovable against an impostor's byte.  THE CONSOLE'S ONLY: the board
     has two 16550s and by the owner's ruling the kernel's own port (printk,
     panic) is unconstrained, so the UART invariant indexes for us
     ([WpUart.chist_at] is this at [Uart0] and [emp] at [Uart1]).  INDEXED
     BY THE ERA NUMBER (lane CONS-IO milestone C), because a process of a
     dead era keeps its linear writer's token inside that era's closed
     invariants and an era-agnostic link would let such a stale writer pay
     the CURRENT era's claim.  ITS FOUNDING IS THE APPLICATION'S OWN, AT THE
     POWER-ON STEP (see [Hpow] below) and not the transport's: a transport
     is a [□] over a bupd that returns its own input, so a founding
     derivable from it is derivable unboundedly.

     [UInitKernel.init_boot_pay] -> [UkInitMain.wp_kinit_start]) and <init>

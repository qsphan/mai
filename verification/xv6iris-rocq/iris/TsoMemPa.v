(** * TsoMemPa.v — the Ztso view machine AT THE MACHINE'S TYPES

    [TsoMem.v] is the leg-T spike: the minimal Ztso machine over [Z]
    addresses and base+byte-list messages, dependency-free, with the
    litmus suite ([TsoLitmus.v]) as its regression harness.  THIS file
    is the same machine restated at the types [RiscvLang.mnode_step]
    actually works in — [Arch.pa] keys, [gmap] image — so the flipped
    arms and the state interpretation can use it verbatim.  See
    [claude-notes/projects/tso-machine-flip.md] §1 for the design and
    the payload ruling; [TsoMem.v] stays as the model of record for the
    litmus verdicts (its shape and this one are the same machine).

    THE PAYLOAD RULING (tso-machine-flip.md): a message carries its
    byte MAP — [pwmsg := { pm_map : gmap Arch.pa (bv 8); pm_tid }],
    minted by the write arm as [PWMsg (write_bytes ∅ pa n v) tid], the
    same snapshot shape the reservations already use ([snap_of]).
    Consequences: [msg_byte] is a map lookup, the flat cache is a
    [foldl] of left-biased unions, and the ONE bridge to the arms'
    [write_bytes] update is [write_bytes_union] — no mword wrap
    arithmetic anywhere in this file.

    The machine, in one breath (TsoMem.v's header has the long form):
    memory-order TSO — a global append-only write log (log order IS the
    total store order; timestamp [S i] = slot [i], [0] = the era
    image), one monotone log index per agent (its VIEW), visibility =
    below-view OR own message (own-always-visible IS store forwarding),
    loads advance the view nondeterministically and read the LATEST
    visible write, stores append without moving the author's view,
    a W→R fence drains (view past the author's last message), and
    exclusive/AMO reads read at the top. *)

(* THE FLAT BYTE MAP, AS A NAME.  A file that imports [SailStdpp.Base]
   elaborates a fresh [gmap Arch.pa (bv 8)] BINDER at the SAIL key instances
   ([Decidable_eq_mword]/[Countable_mword]) and it will not unify with the
   stdpp-keyed one this file and [RiscvLang] use -- the durable-notes binder
   trap, whose error names neither file.  [RiscvLang.v] avoids it by
   importing [SailStdpp.Base] LATE; a leaf file that cannot reorder its
   imports spells the type with this name instead. *)

(** ** THE SOLO ERA: a log with a single author

    The SC collapse above is the collapse AT THE TOP VIEW.  There is a
    second, orthogonal one, and it is what makes the solo-block bracket
    ([HartBlock.v], tso-machine-flip.md RULING 3) true at TSO: when the
    log holds NOTHING BUT [h]'s own messages, the own-author arm of
    [visibleb] fires at every timestamp, so [h] sees the whole log at
    EVERY view and its plain loads read the flat cache no matter where
    the view happens to sit.  "My store buffer is the only one" — the
    boot era before the other harts are released, and the
    device-conformance tester's single-agent runs.

    This is exactly the premise the bracket's plain-load arm needs to
    fold back into [run]'s [s.(mem)] read; the FLAT TIE ([s.(mem)] =
    [flat img log], the [RiscvLang.mm_ok] conjunct) supplies the other
    half.  Note that the collapse is UNCONDITIONAL in [tv]: no
    view-position side condition, which is what keeps the bracket from
    having to thread a view through the block. *)

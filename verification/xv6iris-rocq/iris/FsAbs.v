(* FsAbs.v -- THE SPEC LAYER'S ABSTRACT STATE, AND IT IS A READING.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 1-3
   (v3), lane A items (i) and (ii) of claude-notes/projects/fs-syscall-specs.md.

   PURE LAYER: sections 1-2 and [abs_view] are in FsAbsDefs.v since
   2026-09-04 (Exported from here; see the note above the Require).

   WHAT THIS FILE IS.  Section 1's [absnode]/[anode]/[aview] and section 2's
   client-facing carriers, with EVERY ONE OF THEM DEFINED OFF GHOST STATE THE
   KERNEL PROOFS ALREADY MAINTAIN.  Nothing here is minted, nothing here is
   an invariant, and nothing here asks a landed proof to move (R10):

     [abs_of]   is [FsStateInode]'s readings ([fn_is_dir], [dir_entries],
                [fn_file_bytes], [fn_nlink]) packaged into one record.  The
                decoding is not re-done; [dir_entries] is still
                [FsTree.dir_view]'s FIRST-MATCH reading (fs-fragments.md
                section 1.2) and ".", ".." are ordinary names in it.
     [nview]    is [FsState.top_frag_q] under [abs_of].  Its three laws --
                agreement, split/join, timelessness -- are [top_frag_q_agree],
                [top_frag_q_split] and [top_frag_q_timeless] read through the
                [abs_of] equation, and its STABILITY is the landed mover
                discipline itself: every retag ([InodeRegion.ireg_top_retag_*])
                needs the WHOLE element, so an outstanding share pins the
                node.  That is why there is no cancellation arm anywhere
                below: a share is not a cancellable lend.
     [astate]   is THE γtop AUTHORITY ITSELF, read through [abs_of]
                ([abs_view]): [astate Γ av] is [ghost_map_auth_frac (γtop Γ) 1 I]
                for the [I] whose reading is [av].  No new invariant, no
                [aviewN] (section 9 Q3, ruled) -- and, since durable-disk EV,
                no [fs_state] leg either (see below).

   WHERE THE AUTHORITY LIVES, AND WHY [fs_view] IS GONE (durable-disk EV).
   The EV campaign deleted [FsState.fs_view] -- the old
   [∃ S, ghost_map_auth_frac (γtop Γ) 1 (fss_inodes S) ∗ fs_state Γ S] bundle --
   and put the live γtop authority in ITS OWN invariant,
   [InodeRegion.ftop_inv γfs = inv ftopN (ftop_body γfs)], whose body holds
   the RAW map [I : gmap Z fs_node] beside the arming registry [icfg_lk] and
   the row [ftop_clean I A].  [FsState.fs_state] also grew a [dfrac].  Two
   consequences for this file, and they are the only two:

     (1) [astate] DROPPED THE [fs_state] CONJUNCT.  No lemma here ever used
         the byte legs or [fs_geom] -- [astate_nview_dq] needs the authority
         and nothing else -- so the state predicate was dead weight that only
         served to name an [S].  [abs_view] is correspondingly restated over
         the RAW MAP ([omap abs_of I], live rows -- typed AND linked -- since lanes E2-V/E2-V2) rather than over [fss_inodes S]: that is
         the form [ftop_body] hands out, it is the same function on the nose
         at [I := fss_inodes S], and it keeps [abs_view_lookup] and
         [astate_nview_dq] byte-identical in shape.  [astate_timeless] lost
         its [GTimeless Γ] premise with the byte legs (strictly weaker
         hypothesis, same name).

     (2) [fs_view_astate], the old equivalence, is replaced by an ACCESSOR
         against the authority's real home: [astate_intro]/[astate_elim] are
         the (trivial) intro and elim against a raw [ghost_map_auth_frac], and
         [ftop_astate_acc] / [ftop_astate_ro] in section 5 borrow [astate]
         out of [ftop_body] -- the shape an AU proof uses after opening
         [ftopN].  The live Γ is [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L γfs] and the gname
         tie IS DEFINITIONAL: [fs_gamma_L] is
         [MkFsView _ (fs_link γfs) (fs_top γfs)], so
         [γtop (fs_gamma_L γfs) = fs_top γfs] by [reflexivity]
         ([ftop_gamma_top] states it).  Section 5 is LAST IN THE FILE and its
         [Require Import InodeRegion] sits immediately above it, so the
         region's cone cannot shadow a name any earlier section resolves.
         The give-back wand carries the ROW ([inode_local] at every entry of
         the returned map), because [ftop_body]'s [ftop_clean] is not
         recoverable from an abstract [av]: [abs_of] forgets the record.
         That is the same obligation [InodeRegion.ireg_top_retag_*] already
         charges every mover, so nothing new is asked of a caller.

   SECTION 3's PATH LAYER.  [apath_at] is the hop-by-hop first-match lookup
   the design names [path_at]; it is spelled [apath_at] because
   [FsTree.path_at] -- the same fold over [fstree] -- is landed and sits in
   this file's cone, and shadowing a landed name is how a downstream file
   silently gets the wrong function.  The two are ONE function up to
   [abs_tree] ([apath_at_tree]), so FsTree's path algebra is inherited rather
   than re-proved.

   THE PINNED WALK, RESTATED (section 3's "functional corollary").  A client
   that holds an [nview] share for every directory on the path gets the walk's
   answer AS [apath_at], with no divergence arm and no possible miss.

   ===== READ THE NEXT THREE PARAGRAPHS AS HISTORY (2026-08-30) ==========
   They record how this file's abstracted lend [F] was aimed at the landed
   ghost-trace hop and what the attempt found.  THE DVIEW RETIREMENT deleted
   both the hop ([SpecNameiTr.nx_hop]) and the ghost it lent
   ([DirViewG.dv_half]); the consumed form is [FsAbsEra.ex_hop] = [ax_hop] at
   [FsAbsEra.elend], the era fragment, which discharges the STRONG law
   ([lend_agrees]) that [dv_half] could not.  Everything this file proves is
   stated at the abstracted [F] and did not move.
   ======================================================================

   The walk's hop ([SpecNameiTr.nx_hop]) is [ax_hop] at the lent fragment
   [DirViewG.dv_half]: [ax_hop] is that definition with the lent predicate
   abstracted, so instantiating [F := dv_half] gives [nx_hop] and
   [ax_hops_from] gives [nx_hops_from] ON THE NOSE.  That is a CHECKED
   claim, not a reading of the source -- in a scratch file over the namei
   cone (which is why it is not in this build: it would drag 336 files into
   a spec-layer leaf),

       Lemma nx_hop_is_ax_hop P Pmiss k s :
         nx_hop P Pmiss k s = ax_hop dv_half P Pmiss k s.
       Proof. reflexivity. Qed.
       Lemma nx_hops_is_ax_hops P Pmiss pl n :
         nx_hops_from P Pmiss pl n
         = ax_hops_from dv_half P Pmiss (path_elems pl) n.
       Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

   both close, under `{!riscvGS Σ, !xv6G Σ, !fileG Σ}`.  What the chain lemma
   needs of [F] is exactly one law -- [lend_agrees]: the lent entry map
   agrees with a client-held [nview] -- and it is DISCHARGED here for the
   abstract-state lend [alend] ([alend_agrees]).  For the landed [dv_half] it
   is NOT derivable in this file and must not be faked: [dv_half] is an [own]
   at [icfg_dview] and [top_frag_q] is a [ghost_map] element at [γtop] --
   two disjoint ghosts, tied only inside the icache payload ([ic_loaded]
   carries both since N-1).  That seam is exactly the one
   fs-syscall-specs.md section 2 schedules ("the hop seam moves first, then
   the [dv_*] column comes off the payloads"); when it lands, this file's
   theorem applies unchanged with [F := dv_half].

   ...AND WHAT THE SEAM ATTEMPT FOUND (lane A (iii), [FsAbsSeam.v]).  The tie
   is REAL and it is one landed pure lemma
   ([FsStateEra.dir_entries_era_node]: [dir_entries (era_node dn bm data)] IS
   [dv_of dn data] at a directory), but it lives BESIDE the two ghosts INSIDE
   the payload -- and the payload is in the WALK's hand at the fire instant.
   Two consequences, both machine-checked in [FsAbsSeam.v]:

     (1) [lend_agrees Gamma dv_half] is not merely unproven here, it is the
         WRONG law: no arm can prove the pinned node is a DIRECTORY, since
         [dv_half] rides a file too ("of a file the value is determined
         garbage", DirViewG's header).  [lend_reads] below is the law a
         payload discharges, and section 4a' re-proves the whole package at
         it ([apn_hop_rd] .. [apn_walk_rd]).
     (2) A CLIENT CANNOT HOLD [nview] AT ALL TODAY.  [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded]
         and [IcacheEscrow.ipool_alloc] carry [FsState.top_frag] at
         [DfracOwn 1], so an [apn_pin] against a live inum is REFUTED
         ([FsAbsSeam.ic_loaded_nview_excl], [FsAbsSeam.apn_pin_loaded_excl];
         [top_frag_1_nview_excl] below is the ghost half of it).  The one arm
         that sheds is the READ arm ([ic_rd_arm], at 3/4) -- and there
         [lend_reads] IS discharged ([FsAbsSeam.dv_lend_arm_reads]), so the
         package instantiates at a real top_frag-agreeing lend
         ([FsAbsSeam.apn_walk_arm]).  What namei lends at its fire is
         [dv_half] ALONE, without that arm; closing the seam therefore needs
         a producer of a client-held [top_frag_q] share that survives a
         WRITE-arm checkout, which is a payload change and not a spec-layer
         one.

   BINDERS.  [fsLinkG]/[fsTopG] are [Xv6G.xv6G] MEMBERS, so this file binds
   the members and never the bundle -- FsState.v's own binder list, verbatim
   (durable-notes, "ONE BUNDLE PER GHOST CLASS").  [Xv6Cameras] is IMPORTED,
   not merely required, or [fsTopG]'s field instances would be inert. *)

(* ===================================================================== *)

(* WAS iris/FsAbsPins.v, FUSED IN 2026-08-30 (the FsAbs* leaf fuse).  It was
   a separate leaf for one mechanical reason -- the build mirror's rule that
   a tracked file is not touched -- and its own header said to fuse it "the
   next time [FsAbs.v] is legitimately edited".  Nothing moved: what follows
   is that file's [Section FsAbsPins] verbatim, at the [FsAbsWalk] binder
   list it already copied; [FsAbsPins.v] survives as a stub that
   [Require Export]s this file.

   Owner ruling relayed 2026-08-28: "a client's nview share used for hop
   agreement must come back, not be spent into the accumulator".

   WHAT CHANGES, AND IT IS ONE IDEA.  [apn_P Gamma q av ds ps k d] is
   [<<d = ds !!! k>>] beside the pins the walk has NOT yet spent
   ([apn_pins .. k], the big-op over [drop k ps]).  Each hop peels the head
   pin, uses it for agreement, and DROPS it: after [L] hops the client's
   [nview] shares are gone.  But agreement is NON-DESTRUCTIVE -- the hop
   reads the entry map off the lent fragment against the share and consumes
   nothing -- so the shrinking accumulator was an artifact of the shape, not
   of the logic.

   [apr_pins] is therefore the WHOLE list, carried unchanged through every
   hop, and the hop takes the k-th pin out with [big_sepL_lookup_acc], reads
   it, and puts it straight back.  Three consequences, and they are the
   point:

     - AT THE END the client gets every share back beside the answer
       ([apr_P_final] returns [apr_pins] alongside [apath_at]).
     - AT A DEATH INDEX likewise: the trace contract's failure arm hands
       [P k d] back, and here that IS the whole bundle ([apr_P_pins]).
     - THE ACCUMULATOR NEVER CHANGES SHAPE, so the index bookkeeping that
       [apn_hop] spends four lines on ([Nat.add_succ_r] under a
       [big_sepL_mono]) disappears.

   The section-4/4a' spending forms are NOT touched and are not deprecated;
   [apr_pins_is_apn_pins] is a [reflexivity] receipt that the returning
   accumulator IS the landed one at hop 0, so a consumer can move between
   them with no proof.

   THE MISS ARM IS STILL [False] ([apn_Pmiss]): a miss on a pinned chain is
   impossible, so there is nothing there to return.  The pins that matter on
   a short walk come back through the LEFT disjunct of the contract's
   failure arm, which carries [P k d] itself. *)

     proof is [reflexivity]. *)
  Lemma ftop_gamma_top (γfs : fs_names) : γtop (fs_gamma_L γfs) = fs_top γfs.
  Proof using . reflexivity. Qed.

  (* THE ACCESSOR THAT REPLACES [fs_view_astate].  An AU proof opens [ftopN],
     lands on [ftop_body], and takes this: it gets the abstract state at the
     live Γ, and owes back an authority whose every entry is well-formed.

     WHY THE ROW IS ON THE GIVE-BACK.  [ftop_body]'s [ftop_clean I A] is a
     statement about the RECORDS, and [abs_of] forgets them, so no [av] can
     pay for it; the mover re-establishes [inode_local] anyway ([ireg_top_retag_*]
     charges exactly this, and [FsStateEra.inode_local_of_ok_rec] is the one
     line that assembles it).  The obligation is stated at the STRONGER,
     A-free form -- every entry local -- which implies [ftop_clean I' A] for
     the [A] the body happens to carry, so the caller never has to see the
     arming registry.  A caller that suspends the row instead ([ireg_arm])
     is not this accessor's customer: it moves the map through
     [ireg_top_retag_armed_*] and never opens [ftopN] itself.

     WHY THE GIVE-BACK NAMES THE MAP AND NOT JUST [astate].  [abs_view] is
     not injective (again: [abs_of] forgets the record), so "an [astate] at
     some [av']" does not say WHICH map the caller is returning, and the row
     cannot be charged for a map nobody named.  The caller therefore hands
     back the authority itself -- which is exactly what [astate_elim] gives
     it, at [γtop (fs_gamma_L γfs)] = [fs_top γfs] ([ftop_gamma_top], and it
     is [reflexivity], so the two spellings are interchangeable with no
     rewrite. *)

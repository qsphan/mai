(* SpecSysUptime.v -- the public interface of SysUptime, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     uint64 sys_uptime(void) {
       uint xticks;
       acquire(&tickslock); xticks = ticks; release(&tickslock);
       return xticks;
     }

   The contract: given the tickslock ([is_tickslock], TicksInv.v -- the lock
   over the tick-counter cell at an arbitrary value) and its free cpu field,
   sys_uptime returns SOME 32-bit tick value, zero-extended to 64 bits (the
   [(uint)] return type: the body's slli/srli-by-32 pair), preserves every
   callee-saved register, and gives the cpu field back zeroed.  The value is
   universally quantified in the continuation -- with an invariant that says
   nothing about ticks, nothing more can be said, and a caller must accept any
   reading.  Interrupt/noff bookkeeping is acquire's: the count returns to [n]
   and no [arm_pay] escapes.  Calls no per-process state, and takes NO tp
   premise -- see the note on that at the contract itself.

   The one binder [!wchG Σ] is the tick ledger's (design ni-ticks-ledger.md
   D3, ruling R1): <tickslock>'s payload now mirrors the cell in a counter
   whose name that class carries.  The led twin below hands back the
   counter's receipt for the value read (D4). *)

(* THE LED TWIN (NI-LEDGER-REST, design ni-ticks-ledger.md D4): the landed

   counter's RECEIPT for the value read -- a lower bound [WaitInv.tick_lb n]
   on the mirror at the canonical name [Xv6Cameras.wtk_name], with the
   returned word equal to [n] truncated to 32 bits ([mword_of_int] at
   [mword 32]; the payload's tie [TicksInv.ticks_tie] is exactly that).

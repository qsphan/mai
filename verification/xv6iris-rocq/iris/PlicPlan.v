(* PlicPlan.v -- the KERNEL's plan for the PLIC, as a pure predicate on the
   device model's [plic_state].

   This is software, not hardware: the device model (DevModel.v) says what the
   PLIC *does*, and says nothing about which of its many legal configurations
   xv6 intends to put it in.  This file says what xv6 intends, and it is what
   the device invariant ([dev_inv_body], WpUart.v) maintains.

   [plicinithart] runs CONCURRENTLY on every hart, so no hart can own the whole
   PLIC state across its two MMIO writes: the shared [plic_frag] half lives in
   the device invariant and a hart borrows it by opening that invariant around
   each (atomic) write.  What survives is therefore not a hart's exact context
   but the invariant, and the invariant has to be weak enough that a hart can
   re-establish it from its OWN two writes alone, knowing nothing about what
   the other harts have written.  Hence:

     - the per-context PRIORITY THRESHOLD is left completely free (every
       32-bit value is a legal threshold, so there is nothing to maintain);
     - a per-context ENABLE word may only name interrupt sources this machine
       actually has -- the UART and the virtio disk.

   [plicinithart] writes exactly [(1 << (uart_irq_id Uart0)) | (1 << virtio_irq_id)],
   so its write lands inside the permitted set no matter what was there
   before.

   STATED OVER CONTEXTS AND WORDS, because that is what the device has: every
   context (M and S, [DevModel.plic_nctx] of them) and every word of its
   enable bitmap ([plic_nwords], the board's 96 sources) must name only real
   sources.  Both device sources are below 32, so words 1 and 2 must be
   ZERO -- which is what makes the plan say something about the sources the
   machine has but xv6 does not use, rather than nothing.  xv6 writes one
   word of one context per hart and leaves the rest at their reset zero. *)

   across its write, and because the preservation lemmas below are already

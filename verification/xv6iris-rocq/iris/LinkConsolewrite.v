(* LinkConsolewrite.v -- consolewrite's proof, instantiated against its
   callees'.

   The walk takes [UARTWRITE], the one uartwrite contract there is since
   lane OUT-FUPD retired the located parallel copy, so [Consolewrite] is a
   closed instance of [SpecConsolewrite.CONSOLEWRITE] -- the whole
   device-side chain from the THR store up to consolewrite's return value is
   PROVED, with no assumption beyond either_copyin's and the four the
   uartwrite instance already carries.

   What is still a functor above this is [SpecFilewrite.FILEWRITE] --
   filewrite itself, whose FD_DEVICE arm is where this instance gets
   consumed, at EVERY major and not only the console's: the cell is "null or
   consolewrite" everywhere, and consolewrite's contract is the general form
   because its chain premise is free at the trivial cursor. *)

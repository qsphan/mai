   @ KernelSyms.sys_sbrk = 0x80002938, 40 instructions / 120 bytes; a 48-byte
   frame (ra / s0 / s1 = addr, and ONE slot holding both [int] locals).

   TWO PATHS, AND THE LAZY ONE IS WHY THE COHERENCE INVARIANT IS AN
   INEQUALITY.  The eager path is growproc, so this contract simply reuses
   [SpecGrowproc.growproc_ok] rather than restating its four arms.  The lazy
   path raises [p->sz] and maps NOTHING -- vmfault backs the pages later --
   which is exactly the move [ProcInv.proc_priv]'s [um_below] conjunct
   survives by monotonicity ([ProcPtOwn.um_below_mono]).  A coherence
   invariant stated as an EQUALITY between [p->sz] and the mapped domain
   would make this function unprovable; that it is an inequality is what
   xv6's lazy allocation needs.

   WHAT THE CALLER LEARNS.  Failure is total: [-1] means neither the size nor
   the table moved, on all three failure arms (growproc's, and the lazy
   path's two range tests).  Success returns the OLD size -- sbrk's contract
   with userspace -- and says which of the two paths ran.

   THE WRAP TEST IS DEAD.  [addr + n < addr] can only fire if the 64-bit
   addition wraps, and it cannot: [p->sz] is inside the user region and
   [sint n < 2^63] by [RiscvExtras.sint64_range] alone, so the sum is below
   2^64 with room to spare.  No 32-bit bound on [n] is needed to see it, and
   the contract therefore has no disjunct for it.

   BOTH [myproc()] CALLS ARE HERE.  The lazy path calls it a second time and
   re-reads [p->sz] rather than using the saved [addr]; nothing between the
   two writes the cell, so the value is the same one -- but the proof has to
   say so, and that is why [cur_proc]'s stability matters to this function
   and not to growproc. *)

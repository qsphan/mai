(* WpSconfLock.v -- the SIE-agnostic lock-invariant instruction leaves: the
   four kinds of access xv6's spinlock code makes to a [struct spinlock],
   each opening [lock_inv] (WpLock.v) around exactly one step.  [lockN] is
   disjoint from [minstretN], so the open works in BOTH sie_cap
   arms -- in particular while the absorbing engine's interrupt invariant is
   closed.

     wp_clw_lockopen_s_sconf         -- holding's read (no evidence needed)
     wp_clw_lockopen_locked_s_sconf  -- the same while HOLDING: the word is

     wp_amoswap_lockopen_s_sconf     -- acquire's test-and-set: yields the

   The CPU WORD (+16) -- owned by the invariant, never by a caller:
     wp_cld_lkcpu_lockopen_s_sconf        -- holding's read with no evidence:
                                            the value is whatever it is
     wp_cld_lkcpu_lockopen_locked_s_sconf -- holding's read as the HOLDER:

     wp_sd_zero_lkcpu_lockopen_s_sconf    -- release's [lk->cpu = 0]

   All but the amoswap are short wrappers over the ATOMIC-UPDATE generic
   load/store leaves (WpSconfMem.wp_{load,store}_s_sconf_au), which is where
   the address-translation and byte-level work lives; only the amoswap has no
   generic twin and carries its own copy of that recipe.                    *)

     PAYS FOR IT.  The invariant's held arm carries the acquire's own
     message fragment ([lock_word_ex (Some h0)] = [phys_ledger_word4_vis
     (hart_agent h0) 0]); [TsoCtxLedger.ledger_read_word4_vis_ok] redeems such a
     receipt only for a reader that IS its author, so this obligation --
     discharged at the FRESH [CpuId] the instruction binds -- owes
     [(CIDw : CPU) = h0].

     THAT FACT IS NOT AN ASSUMPTION AND NOT NEW MACHINERY: it is
     [WpNext.wp_next]'s own promise, which the load leaf now threads into
     the obligation (A6.89, [WpSconfMem.wp_load_s_sconf_au_dat]).  At
     [b = false] -- interrupts off, which is exactly what [push_off] buys
     and the literal index [holding()]'s contract is stated at
     (SpecHolding.v) -- the step cannot change harts, so the holder reads
     the word it wrote.  A6.87 §(7) characterized this as a design class:
     at the ctx tower exactness was CONTEXT-relative and migration-safe;
     at the ledger tier with an author receipt it is HART-relative, and the
     kernel's reason it is sound (no migration while holding) had to become
     a stated premise.  This is that premise, and it is one line.

     STATED AS ITS OWN LEMMA for A6.87's reason: the AU's obligation is a
     COQ premise, so an [_] for it is SHELVED, not opened as a goal. <<< *)
  (* >>> A6.119: THE HOLDER'S WORD READ, ON THE VALUE-SET PIN -- §0.35′(iv)
     case 2 verbatim.  The authorship form it replaces was refuted by A6.92:
     `amoswap` writes unconditionally, so a spinner overwrites the word and no
     "this is MY write" claim survives.  What DOES survive is the VALUE: every
     write to a held word is a spinner's or the acquirer's 1, so the pin's set
     [{1}] is preserved by all of them, and a read that lands in [{1}] is
     nonzero -- which is all [holding()] needs.

     THE FLOOR is the acquire's own position, carried here by the holder token
     (§0.34′'s enrichment, A6.119) and discharged against [own_context]. *)

  (* >>> A6.92: THE LEDGER AMO GATE.  It is [lock_word_store_plain]'s
     script with the two differences the AMO makes, and both of them are in
     the MACHINE's own arms rather than invented here ([RiscvLang]'s
     [MemRead]/[MemWrite] cases):

     - the exclusive access takes this hart's view TO THE LOG TOP
       ([tv' = length log] on the read, [S (length log)] on the write),
       where an ordinary store leaves it alone.  That is what makes the
       acquire the one instruction in the system that drains, and the
       model says so in the comment on its own arm: *"the view-at-top is
       what mints the acquire receipt in the lock leaves"*;
     - the word that comes out carries the append's OWN MESSAGE FRAGMENT,
       so it is the HELD arm [lock_word_ex (Some h)] rather than the plain

  (* The word clear with the fate of the invariant left to the CALLER.  At

     to [None], so the zeroed lock word, the cleared cpu word, the ghost state
     and [R] are all in hand at once.  The finisher is handed the
     close-or-destroy choice and those pieces, and decides ([lock_finisher],
     WpLock.v; [lock_finisher_close] and [lock_finisher_destroy] are its two
     canonical instances).  Release is proved ONCE over this leaf and
     instantiated twice -- there is deliberately no close-only and no
     destroy-only twin of this lemma.

     The opening credential IS the holder token: at this instruction the
     caller holds [locked_pre], and that is what proves the lock is not

  (* >>> A6.119: THE [notheld] READ'S OBLIGATION, ON THE COMPLETED KIT.
     The pre-flip generic concluded a predicate about the loaded word from a
     pure premise about the GHOST state -- which A6.92 refuted: the read is
     racy and the word need not be [lk_cpu_val st] at all.  What survives is
     weaker and is all [holding()] needs: whatever the read lands on, it is
     not THIS hart's [struct cpu] pointer.

     THE THREE INPUTS, and each is now a landed piece:
       - the window and the per-agent record, out of the cell
         ([WpLock.lk_cpu_cell_ex_pay], [lk_own_ok_some] at a state this hart
         does not hold);
       - the ANCHOR, out of the cell's own invariant ([lk_own_anchored],
         A6.115) -- free, and for every hart rather than only the creator;
       - the FLOOR, [lk_floor cur_ctx lo] against [own_context] on EITHER
         arm ([WpLock.lk_floor_vis], A6.120): the received handle's bound,
         or the creator's own dirty witness.  This is why the leaf takes the
         plain [lock_openable] again -- A6.112's absorbed opener is retired.

  (* >>> A6.119: THE [notheld] LEAF, ON THE RACY KIT.

     WHAT WENT: the pre-flip generic took a caller premise
     [∀ st, lock_auth γl st -∗ lk_cpu_frag st s -∗ T -∗ ⌜phi (lk_cpu_val st)⌝]
     and concluded [phi] of the LOADED word.  A6.92 refuted exactly that step:
     after the M4 flip the owner cell is racy, so the value read need not be
     [lk_cpu_val st] for the [st] the invariant holds -- the ghost state does
     not determine the word.  The premise is retired here, with A6.92 cited,
     and nothing else in the tree wanted it.

     WHAT REPLACES IT is weaker and is all [holding()] needs: whatever the
     read lands on, it is not THIS hart's [struct cpu] pointer.  The evidence
     is [s ∉ lks] plus the hart's own held-set authority, exactly as before --
     [cpu_locks_not_in] refutes [ex = Some cpu_id] -- but it is now spent on
     the CELL's per-agent record rather than on the ghost state's value.

     THE FLOOR: the racy law wants [ledger_vis] at the reader's receipt, and
     A6.120's [lk_floor_vis] produces it from the plain opener's [lk_floor]
     on either arm -- so this takes [lock_openable], as every other leaf
     does; the absorbed opener of A6.112 §3b is retired. <<< *)

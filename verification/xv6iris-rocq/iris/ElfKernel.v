(* ElfKernel.v -- THE SANITY CHECK: the generated kernel dump IS the
   kernel ELF, read through the general ELF64 semantics.

   Everywhere else in the tree the kernel image is the GENERATED dump --
   [KernelInstrs.kernel_bytes], [KernelData.kernel_data], and the geometry
   constants [kernelEntry] / [kernel_segments] / [kernelMemBase] /
   [kernelMemEnd] / [kernelRodataEnd].  Those come out of
   [tools/dump_elf.py], which does its OWN section/instruction reasoning
   about the linked binary; a bug in the dumper is a bug the proofs cannot
   see, because the dumper's output is what the proofs call "the kernel".

   This file closes that hole, once, by a different route.  It takes the
   kernel ELF as a RAW BYTE BLOB ([KernelElfRaw.kernel_elf_hex], decoded by
   [PStringBytes.pstring_hex_bytes]), runs the general, kernel-agnostic
   ELF64 semantics of [ElfFile.v] over it, and proves by [vm_compute] that
   what falls out is EXACTLY the dump -- byte for byte, in the image
   theorems [kernel_elf_file_image] / [kernel_elf_image], and literal for
   literal in the geometry ones.  The dumper's reasoning and the ELF spec's
   reasoning are independent; agreeing on 41648 file-backed bytes and a
   103208-byte .bss is not something two independent bugs do.

   THE RAW IS THE LITERAL FILE: [kernel/kernel], the binary qemu runs, byte
   for byte, DWARF included.  That is only committable as ground truth
   because the xv6 build passes [-ffile-prefix-map=$(CURDIR)=.]: DWARF
   would otherwise embed the absolute build directory, making the file
   differ between build trees; with the flag it is byte-identical
   (verified from two build directories).  The dumper refuses a file that
   embeds its own build directory, so a flagless build fails loudly
   instead of producing a tree-dependent dump.

   ONE [vm_compute]-HEAVY FILE, BY DESIGN, AND OUT OF EVERY CONE.  Each
   theorem below re-decodes 285200 bytes and rebuilds the maps; that is a
   few seconds apiece and the whole file is well under the minute.  The
   price is paid HERE and nowhere else: NOTHING IN THE TREE IMPORTS THIS
   FILE, and nothing should.  It is a leaf, checked by CI, whose value is
   that it fails loudly if the dump and the binary ever drift apart.  If
   you find yourself wanting to [Require] it from a proof, you want a
   lemma about the dump instead.

   If a [vm_compute] here ever fails, DO NOT weaken the statement.  A
   mismatch between the dump and the ELF is precisely the event this file
   exists to catch: find the disagreeing address (compute both sides'
   lookup) and fix the dumper.  *)

(*  ONE REDUCTION, NOT TWO.  [vm_compute. reflexivity.] reduces the goal in
    the tactic engine and then the KERNEL re-runs the same reduction at
    [Qed] to check the [vm_cast] the tactic left behind, so every sentence
    below costs its [vm_compute] twice ([elf_sections_wf] measured 11.6 s +
    11.1 s; claude-notes/optimization.md, "[Qed] re-checks and therefore
    DOUBLES every [vm_compute]").  [vm_eq] hands the kernel that cast
    directly and typechecks nothing at tactic time: same proof term, same
    VM, and this file goes 54.0 s -> 28.7 s.

    IT MUST BE THE **RIGHT** SIDE: [eq_refl rhs] casts [rhs = rhs] to
    [lhs = rhs] and the kernel reduces the heavy side once, where the
    mirror spelling [eq_refl lhs] makes the VM evaluate it TWICE -- 78.3 s
    on this file, WORSE than the [vm_compute] it replaces.

    THE COST: a disagreement now surfaces at [Qed] as a kernel conversion
    failure with no goal in view.  Put [vm_compute. reflexivity.] back on
    the ONE failing lemma to see it -- and then fix the dump, never the
    statement (see the note at the top of this file). *)

(* THE READER, AT THE HEX STRING.  [elf_read] indexes the 285200-element
   list by a unary [nat] -- every byte of a header near the END of the file

   headers sit at ~280k) measured 9 s.  [elf_read_hex] reads the same bytes
   straight out of the string ([PrimString.get] is O(1)), and
   [elf_read_hex_eq] is the bridge every header reading below rewrites
   through.  (Leave one of them on the list and IT pays the ~13 s: the VM
   builds the header parse once per file and the first reader pays.) *)

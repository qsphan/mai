(* THE DEED'S OWN PIN.  [Pin] is "my subtree is still [t]" -- the claim's

   [TreeView.resolve_hops], computed from [t] alone.

   THE START RULE IS A PREMISE: [um_start_of cw pl] is [ROOTINO] at an
   absolute path and the caller's cwd at a relative one, and either way the
   program knows which and that it is a row of its own tree
   ([d ∈ dom (tv_nodes t)]).  That is design section 3's "the premise the
   program needs -- this path resolves inside my subtree -- is a pure fact
   about its path and its cwd, discharged by its code proof". *)

     +0x32  60e2/6442/6105/8082    the epilogue

   THREE THINGS WORTH KNOWING ABOUT THE SHAPE.

   * THE ERROR RETURN IS HOISTED.  [c.li a0,-1] runs BEFORE the branch, so
     both arms reach the epilogue with the answer already in a0 and there is
     no [c.mv] on the join.  The epilogue is therefore one lemma over the
     value the arm left in a0, not two copies -- the same move ProofSysClose
     makes with a5.

   * [pfd] IS NULL.  sys_fstat wants the [struct file *] and not the
     descriptor index, so it passes 0 for argfd's [int *pfd].  That is
     exactly the case [SpecArgfd.ofd_out] exists for: a null out-parameter
     carries no resource and its store does not happen, so this caller owes
     argfd nothing for it ([ofd_out_null]).  [pf] is a real stack address and
     its non-nullity comes from the frame's own geometry
     ([StackOwn.stack_own_sp_nonzero]), not from an assumption.

   * ARGADDR RUNS BEFORE ARGFD, and its result is never checked -- no
     branch depends on it.  A bad user address is filestat's (i.e.
     copyout's) problem, not this function's -- copyout's contract is
     total in the destination.  Its word is still named ([v1]) below,
     because the postcondition's window sits at it, not because this
     function inspects it.

   ==== THE DESCRIPTOR ENVIRONMENT, AND WHY IT IS NOT A WAND ==============

   S4 froze this contract with an OPENER -- a wand turning the reference the
   descriptor turned out to hold into filestat's environment for THAT file --
   because [SpecFilestat.filestat_env] was indexed by the file's CONTENT and
   a syscall cannot know which file its descriptor names
   ([ProcInv.ofile_slot] quantifies the slot, the fraction and the content
   existentially).  S4' overturned it, and the reason is stronger than
   taste: the opener promised back a [file_ref gf k q'] at a SMALLER
   fraction, and NO SUCH THING EXISTS.  [FileInvDefs.fref_tok] is
   [fref_own g (fragment {[k := (q, 1%positive)]})] -- the reference COUNT
   rides with the fraction -- so two fragments at [q/2] compose to [(q, 2)]
   and not to [(q, 1)].  Splitting a [file_ref] at all needs the ftable
   AUTHORITY, i.e. [FileInv.file_dup_step], which is filedup's ghost step and
   is unsound without the physical [f->ref++].  The opener was therefore
   satisfiable only at [q' = q], with the whole environment already in the
   caller's hands: it deferred the problem rather than solving it.

   What this contract takes instead is [SpecFilestat.filestat_fs_env fn],
   which is content-INDEPENDENT -- [SpecFileclose.fileclose_fs_env]'s form:
   the escrow FAMILY, the sleeplock FAMILY, the inode region, the block cache,
   the disk fabric and the region-wide inum geometry.  The per-inode pieces
   the old environment asked its caller for (the itable slot, the inum, the
   device, the region bound and the SHARE) were inside the reference all
   along: [FileInvDefs.inode_pay] carries
   [IcacheHeld.inode_shr_held_gen (fc_ip Cf) (q * Q) g], which names all four
   and IS the share ilock wants.  filestat carves it out itself
   ([SpecFilestat.filestat_pay_carve]) and gathers it back, so the syscall
   owes nothing per-file at all.  The type test stays filestat's business,
   exactly as sys_close hands fileclose both of ITS arms and lets
   [fileclose_env_split] pick.


   ==== WHAT THE POSTCONDITION SAYS ======================================

   [sys_fstat_post] is PURE, and keyed by [SpecArgfd.arg_fd] so that a
   caller learns which arm ran from data it already has: either the
   descriptor was bad and the answer is -1, or filestat ran and the answer is
   [filestat_ret] (0 or -1).  Note the two are not disjoint on the VALUE --
   a good descriptor whose copyout faults also answers -1 -- which is why
   the disjunction is indexed by [arg_fd] and not by [r].

   The process block comes back at an EXTENDED page table, filestat's
   [uptd_ext]; on the failure arm nothing ran and [P'] is [pv_upt V] itself
   ([ProcPtOwn.uptd_ext_refl]).  The descriptor array is UNCHANGED: sys_fstat
   only borrows the reference and puts it straight back.

   THE MEMORY IS A WINDOW AT [v1], filestat's own -- this contract carries
   it through unweakened rather than restating it, since sys_fstat writes
   nothing of its own.  See the [wp_next] comment below for the shape. *)

  (* THE DESCRIPTOR ENVIRONMENT -- AND IT IS NO LONGER A WAND.

     The header above records the shape S4 froze: an OPENER, a wand turning
     the reference the descriptor turned out to hold into filestat's
     environment for THAT file.  S4' overturned it, and for a reason stronger
     than taste: the opener promised back a [file_ref γf k q'] at a
     SMALLER fraction, and there is no such thing.  [FileInvDefs.fref_tok] is
     [fref_own γ (◯ {[k := (q, 1%positive)]})] -- the count component rides
     WITH the fraction, so two fragments at [q/2] compose to [(q, 2)], not to
     [(q, 1)].  A [file_ref] therefore cannot be split at all without the
     ftable AUTHORITY (that split is [FileInv.file_dup_step], i.e. filedup's
     ghost step, and it is unsound without the physical [f->ref++]).  So the
     opener could only ever be satisfied at [q' = q], with the whole
     environment already in the caller's hands -- it deferred the problem
     rather than solving it.

     What replaced it is [SpecFilestat.filestat_fs_env], which is
     content-INDEPENDENT ([SpecFileclose.fileclose_fs_env]'s form) and which
     a syscall simply OWNS: the per-inode pieces the old environment asked
     for -- the itable slot, the inum, the device, the region bound and the
     share -- are inside the reference all along
     ([FileInvDefs.inode_pay]), and filestat now carves them out itself.
     This contract hands the bundle down and gets it back; the type test is
     filestat's business, exactly as sys_close hands fileclose both of ITS
     arms and lets [fileclose_env_split] pick. *)

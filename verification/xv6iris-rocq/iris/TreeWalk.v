(* [TreeObs.tree_pin_resolves_gen]'s twin one element short.  The start
   rule is a premise exactly as it is there ([um_start_of cw pl] is
   [ROOTINO] at an absolute path and the caller's cwd at a relative one,
   and either way the program knows which and that it is a row of its own
   tree); what is new is only the LIST the resolution runs over.

   THE TERMINAL ROW IS A DIRECTORY, so -- unlike the read side's file and
   device pins -- the projection is NOT the identity and what comes back
   is the entry map UP TO THE DOTS.  That is the honest content and it is
   all a create/unlink consumer spends: it asks whether its own [nm] is an
   entry, and [nm] is proper. *)

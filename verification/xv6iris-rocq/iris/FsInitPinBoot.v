(*  FsInitPinBoot.v -- THE ERA-0 TRANSPORT: THE BOOT'S OWN MAP IS [era0_D] *)
(*  (fs-syscall-specs lane P's recorded GAP (1), closed)                   *)
(* ====================================================================== *)

(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS.  [FsInitPin.v] proved the two era-0 /init pins as
    facts about a FIXED map -- [era0_D], the literal mkfs image's committed
    home blocks -- quantified over EVERY abstract state [S] with
    [FsDurSnap.snap_ok S era0_D].  What it could not say, and recorded as
    its one gap, is that the map a BOOT actually founds its file system at
    is that map: at [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc]'s altitude the era's
    state [S], its block view [Pb], its superblock and its coverage all
    arrive as ERA-GENERIC PARAMETERS, and nothing in the bundle says which
    era this is.

    THIS FILE SUPPLIES THE MISSING IDENTIFICATION, and nothing else.  It
    adds NO new statement to the boot chain, moves nothing (R10), and is
    required by no file: like [FsInitPin] it is a LEAF, and its import cone
    is [FsInitPin]'s own -- every module named below is one [FsInitPin]
    already requires, so no cone anywhere grows.  (That is also the reason
    it is a SEPARATE file rather than an appendix to [FsInitPin]: nothing
    forced the split by hygiene, so the split is made on ALTITUDE --
    [FsInitPin] is a fact about a gmap and computes the image, this is a
    fact about a BOOT's premises and computes nothing -- and it keeps
    [FsInitPin]'s landed text and its empty [Print Assumptions] untouched.)

    THE ERA-0 PREMISE, in its exact landed spelling.  There is no era
    COUNTER at the boot altitude and there deliberately cannot be one:
    [SystemAdequacy.xv6_boot_era] is applied at every power-on and knows
    only what [FsCrash.P_fs_project] tells it about the disk it is booting
    on.  What distinguishes era 0 is therefore an equation about the DISK,
    and it is the one hypothesis [SystemAdequacy.xv6_power_adequacy_xv6Σ]
    takes:

        Hdisk : v_disk (g.(gdev).(dvirtio)) = FsImgDisk.fsimg_dk

    read at the block view the file system works in, i.e.

        FsCrash.fs_blocks dk = FsImgDisk.fsimg_P

    ([fsimg_P] IS [fs_blocks fsimg_dk] by definition, FsImgDisk.v:75).
    Together with [SystemAdequacy]'s own [fsimg_cov] this pins the two
    parameters the crash predicate fixes for the whole execution.  The
    remaining parameter, the log start, is NOT assumed: it is read off the
    era's own snapshot ([FsDurSnap.sk_sbok] -> [FsImg.sbo_logstart] pins it
    at 2) and off the image's superblock ([FsImgCheck.fsimg_sb_logstart]
    checks the same 2), which is exactly how [xv6_boot_era]'s [Hlseq]
    reconciles them.

    THE TWO ROUTES, and both are here because the boot uses both.
      (A) THE MINT'S BUNDLE, [FsCfgBoot.fs_boot_snap_wf] -- literally the
          premise [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc] takes.  Its conjunct (3)
          is [snap_ok S (fs_restrict Pb (fs_home_set cov (sb_logstart sb)))],
          and section 2 shows THAT MAP IS [era0_D].  The step is conjunct
          (6) -- [Pb] agrees with the raw disk off the header's write set --
          plus the fact that at the image the write set is EMPTY, because
          mkfs leaves a clean log ([FsImgCheck.fsimg_wf_log_clean]).
      (B) THE CRASH PREDICATE'S EPOCH, [FsCrash.fs_recovery] -- the route
          [xv6_boot_era] takes to get the epoch in the first place, where
          [FsCrash.fs_recovery_det] pins the lent epoch's map to the
          projection's.  Section 3 shows that at an era-0 disk that common
          map is [era0_D], by [FsCrash.fs_recovery_clean] at the same clean
          log.  Route (B) is also what makes the CRASH-BEFORE-/init
          corollary free (section 3b).

    WHAT IS NOT CLAIMED.  Nothing here says the disk is still the image at
    any later era -- that is refutable, and durable-disk lane E-himg
    deleted the statement that used to say it.  Every sentence below is
    hedged behind the era-0 disk equation, which is a hypothesis about the
    machine the system is SWITCHED ON with and about nothing else.        *)

(* ProofForkret.v -- forkret(), proved: the 26 instructions of the
   already-booted path, ending in the CLOSED trap loop.

   A functor over its three callees' interfaces (myproc, release,
   prepare_return) and over [USERRET_CLOSED], because forkret's last
   instruction is not a return: the [c.jalr a5] at +0x7e enters userret and
   the machine never comes back.

   THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT PLUMBING.

   * THE INDEX CHANGES AT THE release, NOT BEFORE.  forkret is entered
     holding p->lock, so everything up to +0x10 runs at [b = false];
     [release]'s pop_off restores the base enable, so from +0x14 on the index
     is the caller's [eb] and every step may rebind the hart.  The three
     resources that cross that stretch -- the per-cpu bundle and the two
     [_ext] halves of the arm -- are transported ONCE, at the point of use
     (before the [jal prepare_return]), with [wp_next_chain] chaining the
     whole run of binders.

   * THE FRAME GOES BACK INTO THE FREE-STACK CLAIM.  forkret never runs its
     epilogue, so the six slots it pushed at +0x00 are still carved out at
     the [c.jalr] -- and the residue that parks across user mode claims the
     kernel stack WHOLE ([UsertrapRes.ut_stack ksp av], anchored at the top,
     which is what uservec reloads sp to on the next trap).  So the walk
     rebundles the three saved words and the three scratch slots and merges
     them back ([stack_own_app]); the frame's contents are dead by then, and
     nothing ever returns to it.

   * THE EXIT IS [ut_ret2]'s, RE-USED.  What prepare_return hands back is
     what the trap-side residue is made of, and the derivation is the same
     one usertrap's tail performs: the sret-ready mstatus is DERIVED
     ([UsertrapRes.ut_exit_ms_ok]) from the loose SIE quarter's agreement
     with [sconf]'s half and the travelling sret mirror's with [sconf]'s
     tie.  Here it is assembled into [ut_trap] and immediately reopened by
     [ut_trap_tlb_open], which is what hands userret its [tlb_res_pt] and
     leaves the PARKED residue the caller's wand turns into [URes]. *)

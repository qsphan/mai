(* THREE FILES, ONE SECTION -- CUT FOR THE BUILD'S CRITICAL PATH.  This
   file is the VOCABULARY every context-indexed proof needs: the identity,
   the surface facts and their seal, the word towers, [CtxMorph], the
   pristine/physical/ledger DEFINITIONS with their cheap laws, and the
   notations.  It is imported by ~1000 files and sits at the root of both
   routes through the build, so every sentence here is on the critical path.
   The gate PROOFS -- each a multi-second induction -- live in two siblings
   that re-open the same [Section ctx]:

     - [TsoCtxStore.v]  the store gates ([ctx_store_ok], [ctx_store_win_*],
                        [ledger_store_*]) that the M-mode store leaf, the
                        S-mode page-table core and the sconf memory leaf
                        consume;
     - [TsoCtxLedger.v] the pin / wpay / rpay / pinw mints and drops, the
                        relaxed and racy reads, the x-stamp lemmas -- the
                        device drivers' and the boot carve's gates.

   A new lemma goes in the LAST of the three whose imports it needs, and a
   cheap law over a definition here stays here.  A file needs the sibling
   only if it names one of the sibling's lemmas; [Require Import TsoCtx]
   alone is the common case.  The cut was chosen by dependency closure over
   the build's .glob files (claude-notes/optimization.md, "Build shape"). *)
(* TsoCtx.v -- THE CONTEXT SURFACE, REAL (TSO) INSTANTIATION.

   The TSO port's ownership interface Sigma
   ([claude-notes/projects/tso-port.md], legs M and C): every memory
   points-to fact is indexed by a CONTEXT -- a ghost identity for a thread
   of control -- and the ONLY ways a fact changes context are the exported
   transport laws.  UNTIL THE MACHINE FLIP the definitions below ignored
   the index under the seal; NOW ([claude-notes/projects/
   tso-machine-flip.md] §5) they are the TsoCtxTwin2 construction wired
   to the live machine ghosts ([TsoGhost.v] at [riscvEraGS]'s era names,
   over the Ztso semantics of [RiscvLang.mnode_step]):

     - [ctx_pointsto ξ a dq v] is mem_pointsto's body PLUS the byte's
       latest-write TIMESTAMP (a [ts_name] fragment at the fact's own
       dq) PLUS the clean/dirty BIT: clean = a persistent lower bound of
       ξ's own bound covering the timestamp; dirty = a fragment of ξ's
       own dirty set at (t, pa).
     - [own_context ξ] is THE TIE between the CPU's view and the context
       object: both of ξ's authorities (its bound, its dirty set), a
       stable view receipt of the AMBIENT hart dominating the bound
       ([view_lb (hart_agent cpu_id) K] with [B ≤ K] -- every clean fact
       of mine is visible on the hart I am running on), and the per-entry
       justification of the dirty set (mine-on-this-hart, or under the
       bound).
     - [ctx_stamped ξ T]: the authorities with no hart tie, hung on a LOG
       POSITION; the bound IS the stamp (stamping raised it past every
       dirty entry).  The ROOT of every parked chain.
     - [hart_view_lb K] = [view_lb] at the ambient hart: the persistent,
       monotone acquire receipt.
     - [ctx_dom ξ ξ'] -- "ξ is dominated by ξ'" -- carries HALF of ξ's
       authorities, ξ's bound under ξ''s and, per dirty key of ξ, that
       key's justification AT ξ' ([key_at]) -- statable with no machine
       state, which is what makes [CtxMorph]'s bare shape true as
       written.  [ctx_parked ξ ξ'] is the SAME relation at full
       authority: a context parked under a context
       (claude-notes/projects/ctx-parent.md).

   Every law below was first proven of the self-contained twin
   ([TsoCtxTwin2.v], kept as the discovery record); the twin lemma is
   named beside each.  The kit-facing gates at the bottom (the load
   gate, the view-receipt mint, the acquire-side domination mint) are
   what the leaf re-proofs against the Ztso machine consume.

   THE THREE RULINGS THIS FILE ENCODES (owner-ratified) are unchanged:

   1. [CurCtx] IS AMBIENT, LIKE [CpuId] AND [CurKtier]: a file binds its
      context once ([Context `{XI : CurCtx}]) and its spec text does not
      change.  There is deliberately NO default instance.

   2. THE CONTEXT RIDES IN [sie_cap_gpr]: the ambient kernel-execution
      bundle carries [own_context cur_ctx], so no proof threads a NEW
      separation-logic resource, and [wp_next]'s continuation re-anchors
      [CpuId] while cur_ctx STAYS.  [own_context] is what ties the
      context to the current CPU's view state -- now for real.

   3. NO CONTEXT-IRRELEVANCE ESCAPES: a lemma of the shape
      [ctx_pointsto ξ ⊣⊢ ctx_pointsto ξ'] is FALSE here and must never
      exist above the seal.  (The SC-era shim equivalences died with the
      SC bodies; TsoCtxShim.v is a TOMBSTONE since A6.86.)

   THE SEAL IS STILL HERMETIC (the cutover-rehearsal sig-projection
   idiom): the five surface facts are Qed-opaque, each with a named
   [_unseal] equation.  The licensed unseal set grows from {this file's
   law proofs, TsoCtxShim} to include the BELOW-Σ kit re-proofs (the
   load/store leaves, the lock internals) -- they are the instantiation,
   not clients. *)

  (* ---- the STRING tower ([↦ₛ]) ---------------------------------------
     [RiscvPtsto.string_pointsto]'s shape over the context fact: a
     NUL-terminated C string resident byte-by-byte from [a], no alignment
     side condition (a C string is byte-addressed).

     WHY IT IS CONTEXT-RELATIVE AT ALL (tso-port.md §0.21′/§0.22′, the
     ruling that retired the "↦ₛ stays raw" assessment that used to sit
     beside the notations below, and which this workspace's A6.15 had
     recorded).  The earlier assessment read every string in the tree as a
     DISCARDED read-only image literal, whose load obligation the pristine
     (timestamp-0) gate discharges with no context.  That is false of the
     kernel's DYNAMIC strings: [p->name] is written by [safestrcpy] at
     proc.c:290 and exec.c:132, so its bytes carry ordinary ledger residue
     and its readers owe an ordinary load obligation at the reading
     thread's context.  A tier that covers only the pristine case is not
     the string tier, it is a special case of it -- so [↦ₛ] denotes the
     context-relative fact at ARBITRARY timestamps, and the pristine story
     comes back as the DERIVED [ctx_string_all] below (the [kernel_data]
     precedent: one ∀-quantified fact minted once, usable at every
     context), which is what the persistent lock handles carry.

     THE STRUCTURE RULE, since this is the third tier to flip: a tier flip
     never RELOCATES the raw definition.  [RiscvPtsto]'s tower stays put as
     the below-Σ fact and this is a SECOND tower with the same spelling;
     import order decides.  Nothing moved. *)

  (* ---- the DERIVED context-free form -----------------------------------
     [ctx_string_all a dq s]: the string holds at EVERY context.  This is
     the pristine/timestamp-0 story, and it is a DERIVED special case of the
     tower above -- never its definition (tso-port.md §0.21′).

     It exists because the persistent lock handles carry a string.
     [WpLock.lock_name] / [SleepLock.sl_name] are half of [is_lock] /
     [is_sleeplock], which are CLOSED TERMS that ride in park records and
     are minted at boot for consumers that run at their own contexts; a
     handle whose statement mentions an ambient ξ is unstatable elsewhere
     (§0.8′ ruling 2, the root both design problems were routed around).
     The ∀ keeps the handle context-free IN SHAPE while its content is an
     ordinary string fact.

     WHERE IT COMES FROM, honestly, AND WHERE THE ⌜t = 0⌝ ARM IS PAID.
     [KernelDataInv.kernel_data] is itself ∀-context, so
     [kernel_data_string_all] mints this form with no seam; and
     [kernel_data]'s own ∀ is minted by the boot carve out of
     [ctx_pointsto_of_pristine_va_all] above -- a discarded image byte plus
     its pristine receipt, justified by [llb]'s [t = 0] arm, which mentions
     no context.  So the chain rodata -> [kernel_data_string_all] ->
     [lock_name_intro] -> [is_lock] bottoms out in the clean-arm disjunct
     and has no crossing anywhere in it. *)

  (* DOMINATION, ONE RELATION (claude-notes/projects/ctx-parent.md §2).
     [ctx_dom_at ξ ξ' q] -- "ξ is dominated by ξ'" -- carries ξ's
     authorities at fraction [q], ξ's bound under ξ''s ([ctx_floor ξ' B])
     and, per key of ξ's dirty set, that key's justification AT ξ'
     ([key_at]).  A fact of ξ re-indexes to ξ' in two lines: a clean fact
     by [t ≤ B] and the floor, a dirty one by [k ∈ D] and the [key_at]
     that IS its bit at ξ' ([ctx_dom_at_key]).  Whether a key is clean or
     dirty at the target is decided at the MINT, and every mint produces
     this one body:
       1. same hart, both running ([ctx_dom_run]; [ctx_park] is the same
          mint at full authority): ξ's keys REGISTER at ξ' -- ξ's
          buffered stores are ξ''s own messages on this hart;
       2. release, running into a stamped root ([ctx_dom_to_stamped]):
          every key clean under the raised stamp;
       3. acquire and barriers, a stamped root into the running winner at
          a view receipt ([TsoCtxAbsorbLb.ctx_dom_of_stamped_lb],
          [TsoCtxLedger.ctx_dom_of_stamped]): every key clean;
       4. a parked record lends a half to its dominator
          ([ctx_parked_borrow]).
     About ξ' it holds LOWER BOUNDS and MEMBERSHIPS only -- both
     persistent, both preserved by everything that can happen to ξ' -- so
     a dominated context stays dominated while its dominator is parked,
     stamped, resumed elsewhere, moved or morphed.  Nothing about the
     machine: Σ's constraint that domination be statable without the
     state interpretation holds BY CONSTRUCTION.  The relation is NOT
     persistent (a fraction of ξ's authority is inside; a persistent
     domination would license registering later facts): nobody holds a
     borrow while ξ runs.  The big-op is over the ABSTRACT dirty set of
     an existential and sits under [□], so no client ever crawls it;
     inside this file it is framed by name.

     [ctx_dom ξ ξ'] is the relation at a HALF -- the borrow every
     [CtxMorph] transport is stated over (the other half stays in ξ's
     token, and agreement across the halves is what pins the borrow).
     [ctx_parked ξ ξ'] is the relation at FULL authority: ξ wholly
     dominated by ξ', nobody running it -- the thread record at [swtch],
     a forked child under its parent.  Parking and resuming are
     statements about two contexts on one hart and need no fence, no
     view receipt and no stamp ([ctx_park], [ctx_resume]). *)

  (* THE CORE OF MINT 1: a running context ξ' takes on the keys of a

     keeps ξ''s invariant once ξ''s bound has risen to [max B' B] -- both

   is elaborated as the combinator's ARGUMENT -- outside any

   caller's context, identically at every site.

(* M1 STAGE 3: the [↦ₛ] family (tso-port.md §0.21′/§0.22′).  Same
   mechanism, all four dfrac spellings, bracket form included.

   THE ASSESSMENT THIS REPLACES (this workspace's A6.15, recorded here so
   nobody re-derives it) said [↦ₛ] must not move, for two reasons, and
   BOTH were wrong in the same way -- they read the tier off its rodata
   instances only:

   1. "It would put a context inside [is_lock]."  It would, if the handle
      carried the tier's ordinary fact.  It does not: [WpLock.lock_name] /
      [SleepLock.sl_name] carry [ctx_string_all] (above), the ∀-context
      DERIVED form, so [is_lock] / [is_sleeplock] stay closed terms and
      §0.8′ ruling 2 is intact.  The park rows do not move.
   2. "Every string fact in this tree is a discarded image literal, whose
      load obligation the pristine gate discharges."  FALSE: [p->name] is
      written by [safestrcpy] (proc.c:290, exec.c:132) and read by
      [printk("%s", p->name)].  Those bytes are as ordinary as any other
      RAM, and a tier that cannot speak about them is not the string tier.
      They only escaped notice because the proofs walked them through the
      ad-hoc [ProcDefs.pname_cells] byte big-op, never through [↦ₛ] -- and
      that big-op is itself context-indexed already.

   So the tier is context-relative at arbitrary timestamps and the
   pristine case is DERIVED, which is the general rule this port keeps
   re-learning: the definition covers the dynamic case, the static case is
   a lemma ([ctx_string_all_of_pristine] is that lemma, and it is where
   the boot carve's pristine receipts get spent at this tier).
   [ProcDefs.pname_cells] stays its OWN resource (a fixed-size array with
   an embedded string, carrying [ProcGeom.pname_wf]); the bridge to [↦ₛ]
   is the positional borrow/return pair in that file
   ([pname_cells_borrow] / [pname_cells_return]), not a conversion. *)

  (* ...AND THE ENTRY AT A CONSTANT PAYLOAD (GENERIC-PAY).  A process whose
     exit owes a real resource -- the console reader token sh runs on, or
     the taint it becomes -- enters on the GENERIC tail and nothing else:
     the two verified branches above are constructors for programs whose
     payload is the trivial one ([USyncKernel.sync_uexec_slot],
     [UEchoKernel.echo_uexec_slot] both take [my_pay _ (fun _ => True)]),
     so there is no gate to try at a payload they cannot hold.  This is
     the slot [PinnedExec.pex_slot]'s taint arm is answered by.
     [udep] is not needed: the generic tail pays every deposit out of
     [ssupply] alone ([UexecRet.uexec_wp_uslot]). *)
  (* ...AND THE PAYLOAD IS THE PERSISTENT CARRIER (lane SELF-KILL, P6b):
     the resource arrives as the process's own published payment wand
     [□ (app_taint -∗ R)], because both legs of the slot's every
     return need it and nothing travels the trap route to hand it back.
     Free here -- this branch already holds the taint. *)

(* SepThread.v -- ONE lemma: thread a LINEAR resource through a [big_sepL]
   of update steps.

   WHY IT EXISTS (A6.68).  The honest creator deposit (A6.66/A6.67) makes
   every [WpLock] creator take [TsoCtx.own_context cur_ctx] and hand it
   straight back.  That is free at a single call site, but a BOOT
   initializer builds an ARRAY of locks -- [BioInv.bio_init]'s NBUF buffer
   sleeplocks, [IcacheBoot]'s NINODE inode sleeplocks -- and the existing
   idiom there is [big_sepL_mono] into a list of independent fupds, which
   cannot be given the token: [own_context] is EXCLUSIVE
   ([TsoCtx.own_context_excl]), so the fifty steps must run in SEQUENCE,
   each handing the token to the next.

   That is all this file says, and it says it with no tree dependencies at
   all: for any [BiFUpd PROP], a per-element step that BORROWS [Res] and
   returns it folds over the list, borrowing [Res] once.  Stated generically
   in [Res] rather than at [own_context] on purpose -- the same shape is what
   any exclusive boot authority (a supply, an allocator's count) would want,
   and a generic statement cannot drift from the kit. *)

  (* BORROW-AND-RETURN over a list.  [Phi] in, [Psi] out, [Res] threaded: the
     conclusion returns [Res] exactly as the caller lent it, so no
     postcondition downstream of the loop changes shape. *)

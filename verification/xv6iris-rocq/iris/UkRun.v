   parent that token whether it exits or is killed
   ([UserConsole.ucons_pay] is constant by [ucons_pay_const]), so this is
   the class its files carry where they used to carry [ukn_triv] -- and

  (* [avail] is the FREE STACK, in words, below the current sp -- the
     user-mode twin of [sie_cap_gpr]'s counting argument.  The process owns
     it; an sp-adjust hands a frame out of it or takes one back; every other
     instruction threads it unchanged, which is why every leaf that writes a
     register takes [unot_sp] as a premise (a write to sp would move the
     index this ownership is keyed by). *)
  (* THE DESCRIPTOR VIEW IS HIDDEN HERE, exactly as the break and the image
     are: [urun] is what a PROGRAM proof carries between instructions, and a
     program that never looks at its descriptors should not have to name
     them.  A leaf that IS closing back up has just destructed the
     existential, so it can say which view it is at -- the same discipline
     [sz] follows, and the reason [urun_close] takes [fdv] as a parameter. *)
  (* THE DEPOSIT SUPPLIER AND ITS MINTING LAW.  Since the ARM, the trap
     contract's returning arm demands the process's bundle for the number it
     is at ([UexecRet.uexec_dep_F]); a leaf below the file-system tower
     cannot see that the instance's [sbundle_at] is [emp] at its number, so it
     pays with the law below.

     WHY IT RIDES IN [urun] AND NOT IN [uvb], AND WHY IT IS ABSTRACT.  A
     [uvb] conjunct would make the KERNEL owe the supply to resume ANY
     process, and an application whose predicate is not trivially true
     cannot pay that -- echo's is [taint ∨ pins], true of every view only
     after the taint is minted -- so every pre-taint trap round would be
     unsatisfiable: the GAP-premise trap sitting in the trap loop.  Carrying
     a CONCRETE [□ ssupply] here instead is the SAME refutation one level
     down: echo could not build a [urun] at all before the taint.  So what
     rides here is an ABSTRACT supplier the program chooses, the way [Rut]
     and [Rfd] are abstract, with the numbers it undertakes to pay for
     ([psok]) beside it -- both fields of the ambient [UexecSG.uprogSG],
     which is what keeps every program lemma statement from naming either.

     THE LAW IS KEY-FREE, AND THAT IS FORCED, NOT CHOSEN.  A law stated at
     [urun]'s own bound key would have to survive every move the program
     makes to that key, because [urun] is re-established after every
     instruction: a store moves [M] ([urun_close] at
     [umem_write M …]), sbrk moves [pm] and [sz], open / dup / close / pipe
     move [fdv], and every returning ecall moves [cw].  Closed under all
     five, a key-indexed law IS the key-free one.  So the admission [psok]
     is a set of NUMBERS, and a bundle whose content reads the key -- exec's,
     which reads argv out of the image -- is not payable through this law at
     all: it goes the EXPLICIT-PREMISE route the exec leaf already uses
     ([UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_exec] takes the deposit as a hypothesis), which
     is why [USYS_exec] is excluded here.  A bundle that IS key-free once
     the descriptor view is fixed -- echo's console write, whose input is a
     trace seed minted from unit -- goes through the law.  THE HONEST
     CONSEQUENCE: a program admitting a number pays that number's bundle at
     EVERY key, not only at the call it is about to make. *)
  (* BUPD-SHAPED, like the class's own two laws ([UexecSG.v]'s header): a
     bundle may hold a resource that is free but not derivable from [emp]
     -- write's console arm carries the trace seed, the mono-list unit --
     and putting the update in the LAW rather than in a particular supplier
     is what keeps such a piece payable by a program whose supplier is
     [emp].  The ARM still demands a plain [sbundle]; the leaf runs the
     update inside its own WP step. *)
  (* ...AND THE LAW NAMES THE PAYLOAD (app-echo.md, "SH-LINE RULING", R1).
     read's bundle is a WAND FROM THE DEPOSITING PROCESS'S OWN EXIT
     PAYLOAD, and a leaf must deposit at the family whose payload it is
     about to pay the trap's payment row at ([UexecRet.uexec_pay_dep]) --
     so the mint takes that payload rather than choosing a family and
     leaving the leaf to re-key, which [UexecSG.sbundle_at_at] no longer
     licenses at read.  Every [Q] is admissible: read's console arm is
     payable out of the persistent credential at any [P]
     ([FsAbsInvFire.fsabs_fileread_in]). *)
  (* ...AND CLOSE(21) IS A SECOND, KEY-GUARDED LAW (design/pipe.md, "The
     byte queue").  Clearing a pipe end's flag word steps the pipe's EXACT
     ghost state, so [UexecSG.free_num] no longer admits 21 and the
     key-free law above cannot mint it: at a PIPE key the deposit is a
     close link, payable only by a holder of the fragment or by the taint.
     At every OTHER descriptor it is [emp] -- and that is a fact about the
     KEY, not about the number, which is why it cannot be a clause of
     [psok] and is a law of its own.  The close leaves hold the HANDLE that
     decides ([UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_close]), so a caller of theirs that
     closes anything but a pipe carries no row at all. *)
  Definition ukey_nonpipe (W : uvis) : Prop :=
    forall (rb wb : bool) (gp : pipe_names),
      fd_st_of_key (tf_w (uvis_tf W) (tf_arg_idx 0)) (uvis_fd W)
      <> FdOpen rb wb (FdPipe gp).

  (* ...AND EXIT(2) IS A THIRD ONE, close's twin over a WHOLE TABLE
     (design/pipe.md, "The exit path").  kexit closes every descriptor the
     dying process holds, so the exit number's bundle row is
     [SpecFileclose.fileclose_cpays] of the KEY's own table
     ([UexecExecInst.xv6_sbundle] at 2), and 2 left [UexecSG.free_num] with
     it.  At a table that holds no pipe row every payment is [emp] and the
     row is minted from nothing ([UexecExecInst.xv6_sbundle_exit_nopipe]);

  (* [avail] is the FREE STACK, in words, below the current sp -- the
     user-mode twin of [sie_cap_gpr]'s counting argument.  The process owns
     it; an sp-adjust hands a frame out of it or takes one back; every other
     instruction threads it unchanged, which is why every leaf that writes a
     register takes [unot_sp] as a premise (a write to sp would move the
     index this ownership is keyed by). *)
  (* THE DESCRIPTOR VIEW IS HIDDEN HERE, exactly as the break and the image
     are: [urun] is what a PROGRAM proof carries between instructions, and a
     program that never looks at its descriptors should not have to name
     them.  A leaf that IS closing back up has just destructed the
     existential, so it can say which view it is at -- the same discipline
     [sz] follows, and the reason [urun_close] takes [fdv] as a parameter. *)
  (* THE ECALL LEAF'S DEPOSIT PREMISE, as a WAND OFF THE AUTHORITIES the
     leaf already holds -- and it has to be a wand and not a bare premise:
     the key the deposit is at is [uvis_of_run m pc M pm sz fdv cw], and
     [M] / [pm] / [sz] / [fdv] / [cw] are bound by [urun]'s own existential,
     so a leaf has them only AFTER it destructs and can never name them in
     its own statement.  Same wall as the key-free law above, one level out.

     THE DISJUNCTION IS THE TWO ROUTES.  Left: the number is one the program
     admits ([psok]), and the leaf mints the bundle from [udep] --
     [udepw_mint].  Right: the program hands an EXPLICIT deposit at this
     key, which is what exec takes always, and what a program with a
     key-reading bundle (init's mknod, a constraining application's write)
     takes at its own numbers. *)
  (* THE PAY FACT IS LENT WITH THE HEAP.  The exec bundle a supplier may
     have to produce carries the depositing process's own knowledge of its
     payload ([UexecExecInst.exec_sbundle]), which is keyed at the KEY's
     generation -- bound by this ∀, so it cannot come from anywhere but
     here.  The run holds it ([urun]'s own conjunct) and the minting law
     below is what lends it; persistent, so lending costs nothing and
     nothing has to come back. *)

     HANDS THE POST TO THE PROGRAM cannot use that shape -- the program has

     can ever say again, so after pipe(2) only the TAINT was left and a
     verified program could not hold a pipe.  The left arm is now the
     REGISTRY: one persistent registration per row

     dup'd row and a forked child's copy of the table all pay from the same
     handle, and the fragment itself never has to be in the run.

     THE TAINT ARM STAYS, for two reasons and neither is the old one: the

  (* THE EXEC DEPOSIT'S CARRIER, and why it is key-free too.  exec is the
     one number the law above excludes -- its bundle reads argv out of the
     key's image -- so its deposit takes the EXPLICIT route.  But the key an
     exec ecall traps from is built by the walk that reaches it ([M], [pm],
     [sz], [fdv], [cw] bound by [urun]'s existential, the register file by
     the caller's own instruction sequence), so no lemma up the chain can
     NAME it: what a program that execs carries is the bundle AT EVERY KEY,
     persistently.  This is the ARM's spelling of the enriched tier's own
     supplier: a program that execs takes it as an explicit premise and
     hands it down to its exec leaf, and the kernel-side constructor -- which
     sits above the file-system tower and holds the process's exec bundle --
     is what pays it.

     NOT IN [urun].  A conjunct there would make EVERY program owe the exec
     bundle at every key, which is the GAP-premise trap [udep]'s note
     refutes one number over: a constraining application (echo, at
     [Dsup := emp]) could not build a [urun] at all. *)
  (* ...AND IT NAMES THE PAYLOAD, WHICH FOR THIS SUPPLIER IS THE TRIVIAL
     ONE (EXEC-PAY).  exec's bundle READS the depositing process's own exit
     payload -- it is what the kernel hands the new image's slot
     ([SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre]'s two wands, and the [Q (-1)] beside the
     pay fact) -- so a supplier can no longer hand a bundle at SOME family
     and let the leaf re-key it ([UexecSG.sbundle_at_at] no longer licenses
     that at exec): it names the payload, exactly as read's mint does.
     [uxsup] is the supplier a program that answers for NOTHING carries,
     and such a program's payload is [fun _ => True] -- so this is the
     bundle at that payload, and its two consumers below take
     [ukn_triv].  A process whose exit owes something real (sh, once it
     holds the console reader) execs on a PINNED supply instead
     ([UkInit.init_exec_sup]'s shape), which names its own payload. *)
  (* ...AT A CHOSEN PAYLOAD (GENERIC-PAY).  Once the generic slot exists at
     a CONSTANT payload, a program whose exit owes a real resource can
     take this supplier too: the bundle names the payload the exec'ing
     process pays the trap's payment row at, and the kernel relays that
     resource to the new image's slot ([SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre]).  [uxsup]
     is this at the trivial payload, which is what a program answering for
     NOTHING carries. *)

     resolved from.  What such an application has is the bundle at every
     key whose cwd is the ONE inum its process is at -- and that is NOT a
     [udepw], because the [cw] a [udepw] must answer at is bound by its own
     ∀ and only agreement against [urun]'s half can pin it.  The agreement
     therefore happens in the LEAF, which has destructed [urun] and holds
     that half: see [UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_exec_at_cwd], which takes the

     free to ignore what it is lent ([udepw_at_of_bundle] below is that
     supplier).  A PINNED bundle is not: it owes [exec_path_of M pv pl] --
     the path string read out of the program's own rodata, which is a fact
     about [M] and reaches a supplier through [UserHeap.uheap_text] -- and

  (* THE ENTRY, with the process's initial free stack carved out of its data.
     [avail] words below the resume sp become [urun]'s free stack; the rest
     of the data is DROPPED (affinely), which is fine for a program whose
     only memory is its stack.  A program that also needs static data wants
     the non-lossy form of [ubytes_of_map], which its induction already
     produces -- see the note there.

     The two premises are exactly what the old [uk_stack] gate decided, in
     the vocabulary of the heap: enough room below sp, and the bytes there
     actually present in the data half.  [sz] is bound by the slot, so the
     second is stated for every [sz] the bundle could carry. *)

       is where it comes in.  It is a fact about the key the kernel handed
       over and it travels the way every other such fact does:
       [SpecKexec.kexec_image_ok_fd] says an exec'd image's table IS the
       exec'ing process's, so a chain of pipe-free programs stays pipe-free
       and the boot process's table is [FdSlots.fdt0], all closed.  A

       that makes it honest: a constructor may claim a set only if every
       unparked row of the key's table is in it.  Every landed entry
       passes [empty] at a table the kernel has just handed over
       ([SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre]'s all-parked row,
       [FdSlots.fdv_all_parked_fdt0] at the boot), and a constructor for a

(* FsAbsEra.v -- THE ERA-FRAGMENT LEND: what lane A-iii's option (b) walk
   fires at each hop, and the three laws that make it worth firing.

   Worklist: claude-notes/projects/fs-syscall-specs.md, lane A item (iii),
   the user's 2026-08-28 ruling ("OPTION (b): the campaign builds the
   era-fragment walk").  Design of record: claude-notes/design/
   fs-syscall-specs.md v3, sections 2-3.

   (THE DVIEW RETIREMENT, 2026-08-30: the "first" lend and the contract that
   fired it are DELETED -- this file's lend is the only one left, and the
   history below is why it was built.)

   WHY A SECOND LEND EXISTS AT ALL.  [FsAbsSeam] settled item (iii)'s three
   findings: the dv<->top tie is real and pure ([dir_entries_era_ok], as it
   is now spelled), the
   law a payload can discharge is [FsAbs.lend_reads] and not
   [lend_agrees] -- and the landed fire ([SpecNameiTr.nx_hop], which R10
   freezes) passes only [DirViewG.dv_half] through the caller's fupd, so a
   client-side hop learns NOTHING about gamma-top.  The fix the owner ruled
   is not a payload change but a SECOND WALK: same 334 bytes of namex, same
   contract shape, one different resource crossing the caller's [={T}=*].
   This file is that resource, stated once, so the walk's proof
   ([ProofNamexEra]) and its consumers ([SysMknodDefs]'s prover) share a
   vocabulary instead of each unfolding a ghost.

   THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.  [elend Gamma d dq ents] is the era
   fragment at [d] TOGETHER WITH the two pure facts that make it readable:

       exists n, top_frag_q Gamma dq d n
                 /\ fn_is_dir n = true /\ dir_entries n = ents.

   Three deliberate choices.

     (1) THE NODE IS EXISTENTIAL, because [FsAbs.ax_hop]'s [F] has the
         signature [Z -> dfrac -> gmap fname Z -> iProp], fixed by the
         frozen trace vocabulary.  Nothing is lost: the walk lends HALF its
         element and keeps the other half, so [top_frag_q_agree] pins the
         returned node to the lent one ([elend_fire_hit] below).  That is
         the whole reason the fire splits rather than lending [DfracOwn 1]:
         at the whole share the caller could hand back a DIFFERENT node
         with the same entry map, and the walk could not re-pack its
         [ic_loaded].

     (2) DIRECTORY-NESS IS CARRIED, not left to the caller.  [dv_half]
         could not carry it ("of a file the value is determined garbage",
         DirViewG's header) and that is exactly why [FsAbsSeam] had to fall
         back on the weaker [lend_reads].  The era fragment CAN: the walk
         has already tested [ip->type == T_DIR] before it calls dirlookup,
         so the fact is free at the fire.  Consequence: this lend
         discharges the STRONGER law ([elend_agrees] : [lend_agrees]) and
         [lend_reads] comes off it by [FsAbs.lend_agrees_reads].  Both the
         section-4 package ([apn_walk]) and the section-4a' one
         ([apn_walk_rd]) therefore instantiate here.

     (3) THE ENTRY MAP IS [dir_entries n], NOT the record's own byte
         reading.  Those are one function on a payload node
         ([FsAbsSeam.dir_entries_era_ok]) and
         [elend_of_era] is that bridge; but the CLIENT-facing side of the
         lend must speak the abstract state's own reading, or
         [FsAbs.astate] cannot be read against it.  [elend_astate] is what
         that buys: inside the hop's fupd a consumer opens ftopN, takes
         [FsAbs.ftop_astate_ro], and reads the parent's row out of [av]
         AS [ADir ents].  That -- not the pinned walk -- is the
         non-vacuous consumption route today, see the note below.

   WHAT THE PINNED WALK DOES AND DOES NOT GIVE (recorded so the next lane
   does not re-discover it).  [apn_walk_era] is [FsAbs.apn_walk] at
   [F := elend], a theorem.  But the walk holds the WHOLE element at the
   fire (it keeps 1/2 and lends 1/2), so a client holding any [nview] share
   of a directory ON the chain is still refuted -- [FsAbsSeam]'s finding 3
   is about the payload's custody and a new walk does not change it.  The
   package is therefore instantiable but VACUOUS for a live inum, exactly
   as [FsAbsSeam.apn_walk_arm] is non-vacuous only under a read lock.  What
   the era walk really delivers over the dv walk is [elend_astate]: the hop
   reads the AUTHORITY's row, which needs no client-held share at all.  A
   non-vacuous pin waits for the tree layer's exclusivity fact (the ruling's
   own words), not for another walk.

   AND THE PINS COME BACK (owner ruling, relayed 2026-08-28).  Agreement is
   non-destructive, so the shrinking accumulator of [FsAbs.apn_P] was a
   shape and not a necessity.  [FsAbsPins] restates the package with the
   client's whole bundle carried through every hop and handed back at the
   end -- and at any death index too, since the contract's failure arm
   returns [P k d] itself.  [apr_walk_era] below is that package at this
   lend, and it is the form a consumer should instantiate;
   [apn_walk_era] is kept beside it only because [FsAbs]'s own statements
   are frozen and a reader will look for the landed shape first.

   BINDERS.  [FsAbsSeam]'s, minus the two slot classes it needed for
   [ic_rd_arm]: the BUNDLE [xv6G] and never a member (durable-notes, "ONE
   BUNDLE PER GHOST CLASS").  [FsAbs] is REQUIRED LAST for the same reason
   it is there -- its [Require Export FsState] must win on the [FsState*]
   stack's shadowed names. *)


(* ==== WHAT IS IN THIS FILE (the FsAbs* era leaves, fused 2026-08-30) ====

   THE ERA WALK'S WHOLE VOCABULARY IS HERE.  Four files were one lane's work
   split only by the build mirror's rule that a tracked file is not touched;
   each of their headers said to fuse them "when [FsAbsEra.v] is next
   edited", and this is that edit.  Every statement and proof below is the
   original text, in its original section at its original binder list:

     section 0    [dir_entries_era_ok] / [abs_of_era_dir] and the payload
                  exclusions -- WAS iris/FsAbsSeam.v (whose surviving half
                  is exactly the pure bridge section 4 consumes).
     sections 1-5 the lend itself -- this file's own.
     section 6    the NAMEIPARENT prefix family -- WAS iris/FsAbsNpar.v.
     section 7    the DEFERRED START -- WAS iris/FsAbsStart.v.

   All four old names survive as stubs that [Require Export] this file, so
   no consumer moved.  The require block below is the four blocks' UNION,
   with [FsAbs] still LAST (and [TsoCtx] still qualified). *)

(*  0.  THE PAYLOAD SEAM (was iris/FsAbsSeam.v, fused 2026-08-30)         *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* WHAT SURVIVED THAT FILE.  It asked whether [FsAbs.apn_walk]'s abstracted
   lend law could be discharged at [F := DirViewG.dv_half], the resource the
   landed ghost-trace namei lent at every hop.  The dview retirement deleted
   both the hop and the ghost; three things outlived them:

     1. THE TIE IS PURE AND WAS ALREADY LANDED -- the payload's contents
        reading and its era fragment's are ONE function.  That is
        [dir_entries_era_ok] (and its abstract-node form [abs_of_era_dir]),
        which section 4's [elend_of_era] consumes.
     2. [lend_agrees] WAS THE WRONG LAW at that lend, because [dv_half] rode
        a FILE too -- which is exactly the weakness the era fragment does
        not have (it carries the type), so section 2's lend discharges the
        strong law after all.
     3. NO CLIENT CAN HOLD [nview] WHILE THE WALK RUNS.  [Section
        FsAbsSeam] below is still a theorem about the landed payload and
        still says a pin against a live inum is refuted.

   one the walk has already tested.  (This was [dv_of_dir_entries], stated at

(* FsAbsNpar.v -- THE NAMEIPARENT SIDE OF THE ERA WALK'S VOCABULARY: the
   hop family over the PARENT PREFIX, and the death arm a nameiparent walk
   can actually reach.

   Worklist: claude-notes/projects/fs-syscall-specs.md, lane A item (iii),
   REMAINING item ("the NAMEIPARENT walk").  Design of record:
   claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md v3, sections 2-3.

   (WAS A LEAF, iris/FsAbsNpar.v, for the mechanical reason [FsAbsPins] was
   one: the EC2 build mirror forbids touching a tracked file.  FUSED IN
   2026-08-30, as its own text asked; the stub at the old name re-exports
   this file.)

   NOTHING HERE IS A NEW KIND OF HOP.  [ep_hop] is [FsAbs.ax_hop] at
   [FsAbsEra.elend], by [reflexivity] -- the very same hop [FsAbsEra.ex_hop]
   is.  What changes is the LIST it ranges over.

   THE ONE IDEA.  nameiparent walks one element LESS than namei: it
   dirlookups every element but the last, and returns the directory the
   last element would have been looked up IN.  So its trace family is the
   hop list over [removelast (path_elems pl)] -- which is, definitionally,
   [SysMknodDefs.npar_elems pl], the family lane W's
   [FsAbsEraMknod.npar_walk_pre_era] already produces.  Stating the
   contract over the parent prefix is therefore not a design choice with
   alternatives: it is the only shape a create-side caller can supply.  (An
   earlier sketch had the walk take the FULL family and hand the last hop
   back unfired; that is unsuppliable, because producing the extra hop is a
   real fupd obligation and the caller has no directory to discharge it
   against.)

   THE DEATH ARM IS THE GENUINELY NEW STATEMENT.  The frozen namei shape
   ([SpecNameiTr] / [SpecNamexEra]) is

       exists k d, k < L /\ ((P k d * hops k) \/ (Pmiss k d * hops (S k)))

   and it cannot express two things a nameiparent walk really does.

     (1) THE PARENT'S OWN TYPE TEST.  namex runs [ip->type == T_DIR]
         (+0xbc) and its nlink guard (+0x7a) at EVERY level it reaches --
         including the LAST one, the level whose directory is the parent
         being returned.  A death there is at index [k = length ps], one
         past the last hop, which [k < length ps] refuses.

     (2) "nameiparent of /".  When the path has no elements at all the loop
         never runs: namex falls out at +0x140, iputs, and returns 0 with
         the cursor and the (empty) family untouched.  That is [k = 0] with
         [length ps = 0], which again [k < length ps] refuses.

   So the LEFT disjunct's bound is [k <= length ps] and both cases land in
   it.  The RIGHT disjunct -- hop [k] fired and MISSED -- keeps a STRICT
   bound, and honestly so: dirlookup is reached only after the walk has
   decided the element is not the last one, so a miss cannot happen at the
   parent level.  The two bounds differ by exactly the instruction order of
   namex's loop body, which is the point of stating them separately rather
   than weakening both.

   for [FsAbsNpar]'s reason -- the mirror forbids touching a tracked file.
   FUSED IN 2026-08-30, which is what its own text asked for: "fuse the
   three [FsAbs*] era leaves when [FsAbsEra.v] is next edited".)

   ==== WHAT THE GAP ACTUALLY WAS =======================================

   The era contracts ([SpecNamexEra], [SpecNparEra] and the wrappers over
   them) carried TWO trace premises -- [P 0 ROOTINO] and the hop family --
   beside the scope premise [pfun 0 = SLASH].  A RELATIVE walk starts at
   [idup(p->cwd)] instead, and the recorded blocker (SpecNameiTr's Q-c,
   restated in [SpecNparEra]'s header) was that no landed reading exposes
   the cwd's inum: [IcacheHeld.inode_held] hides it existentially, so
   [P 0 <the cwd's inum>] is not a formula the caller can write.

   IT DOES NOT HAVE TO BE.  The caller never needs to NAME the start inum
   -- the WALK knows it, and knows it at exactly the instant it matters:
   idup's postcondition hands back a package whose existential witness IS
   the slot's inum, so the proof reads it there and instantiates the
   caller's trace at that value.  What the contract has to carry is
   therefore not an exposed cwd but a trace that is PARAMETRIC in the
   start: a one-shot, universally quantified over the start inum, with the
   only tie a caller can be expected to know -- an ABSOLUTE path starts at
   the root.

   That is precisely the shape lane W's [FsAbsEraMknod.npar_walk_pre_era]
   was already written in (that file's ∀ pl r with the [pl !! 0 = Some
   SLASH -> r = ROOTINO] side condition), which is why the consumer side
   needed no invention: [ep_start] at lane W's own [pl] IS that predicate
   ([FsAbsNparMknod.np_start_of_mknod], one [iMod] and a [vm_compute]).

   ==== THE ABSOLUTE ARMS DO NOT WEAKEN =================================

   [ex_start_of_pair] / [ep_start_of_pair] are the receipts: a caller
   holding the landed pair, on a path that begins with SLASH, builds the
   deferred form and loses nothing (the tie forces [r = ROOTINO], so the
   pair it holds is already at the right index).  So every consumer of the
   old contracts composes through the new ones, and the strengthening is
   one-directional.

   ==== THE TIE IS ON THE PATH LIST, NOT THE BUFFER =====================

   [pl !! 0 = Some SLASH] rather than [pfun 0 = SLASH]: the walk has both
   ([pl = bview plen pfun]) but only the list form is statable at the
   altitudes above namex, and it is lane W's spelling.  The two head
   lemmas below are the bridge, and they are the reason the walk's
   RELATIVE arm can discharge the tie at all -- it holds [pfun 0 <> SLASH]
   and needs the [pl] form refuted. *)

(* The other direction needs the buffer to be NONEMPTY, and [bb_cstr]

(* IcacheInv.v -- the INODE CACHE's definitional layer: the [itable]'s
   geometry, the reference-count ghost state, the two homes the physical
   cells live in (the itable spinlock and a shared invariant over the [ref]
   words), and the pure facts about an inode that the model owed [itrunc].
   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md.

   Nothing here proves a step about any instruction and nothing here is a
   function contract: iget / idup / iput are owned by another effort, and
   this file is what their contracts will be stated over.

   ---- WHY THE [ref] WORDS ARE IN AN INVARIANT, NOT IN THE LOCK ---------

   xv6's own comment says [itable.lock] protects [ref], [dev] and [inum].
   That is true of every WRITE, and it is what the ftable does
   (claude-notes/design/file-table.md), but it is NOT true of every read:
   [ilock] and [iunlock] load [ip->ref] holding no spinlock at all, purely
   to refute their [panic] arms.  A cell a lock's resource owns cannot be
   read by a thread that does not hold the lock, and a cell whose fraction
   has been handed out to reference holders cannot be WRITTEN by
   [iget]/[idup]/[iput], which do hold the lock.  So the [ref] words go in
   an Iris invariant and the authority is SPLIT: half inside the invariant,
   half inside the lock's resource.  Holding the lock's half is what pins
   [M] across a read-modify-write ([lw; addiw; sw]); holding a reference
   fragment is what lets a lock-free reader conclude its slot's count is at
   least one.  [dev] and [inum] keep the ftable's discipline exactly --
   fractional, immutable while the entry is live.

   ---- AND WHY THE LIVENESS POOL IS IN THE SAME INVARIANT ---------------

   A SHARE ([IcacheRef.inode_shr], design §14.6) is an identity slice with
   NO count fragment -- [positiveR] has no zero, so under this algebra a
   share simply is not an [icacheUR] element (§14.5).  It therefore cannot
   use [iref_lookup] to learn its slot is live, and a share-holding
   [ilock] still has to refute the [ref < 1] panic holding no lock.

   [live_pool] is what it uses instead: ONE fractional unit per slot, whose
   WHOLE is held right here whenever the slot is free.  Owning any slice of
   it therefore refutes freeness ([live_slot_live]) -- the support clause
   is OWNED, not asserted, so no [dom]-inclusion invariant has to be carried
   or re-established.  A live slot's unit is split [qt] to the reference
   holders (inside [iref_tok], canonically paired with their identity
   fraction) and [1 - qt] to this invariant's arm, so the LAST close
   reassembles the whole unit out of the closer's own slice plus the arm and
   RETIRES the slot -- §14.6's "mass conservation IS the witness", and the
   reason [ProofIput]'s REF-1 derivations did not have to change.

   ---- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE -----------------------------------

   The per-entry CONTENT (ip->valid, the five metadata cells, the thirteen
   addrs cells, the file's blocks) lives in [IcacheEscrow.ic_escrow], the
   three-armed per-entry escrow built ON TOP of this file: the sleeplock
   keeps only that escrow's checkout token.  This file supplies the pieces
   it is keyed by -- the identity cells, the reference algebra and the
   [ref]-word invariant -- and nothing above them.                         *)

   Three instructions in the tracked image pin all of it, and none of them

     iget +0x22   addi s1,s1,-1796  # 80020888 <itable+0x18>
                       s1 = &itable.inode[0]        ==> the lock is 24 B
     iget +0x3c   addi s1,s1,136    the scan's stride  ==> sizeof = 136
     iget +0x40   beq  s1,a3,...    with

                       &itable.inode[NINODE] IS the address of the next
                       symbol, so 24 + 136*NINODE = log - itable.

   iinit's loop corroborates both from the other end: it starts at
   [itable+0x28] = &inode[0].lock (entry + 16, the sleeplock's own offset,
   [InodeInv.i_lock]) and stops at [log+0x10] = &inode[NINODE].lock.

   24 is [sizeof(struct spinlock)] -- uint + 4 bytes of padding + two
   pointers -- and 136 is [sizeof(struct inode)] = 132 rounded up to the 8
   the embedded sleeplock forces (InodeInv.v's header).                    *)

   cannot supply -- recorded as owed in claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md,
   which guesses it belongs either in [blkmap_wf] (which would then have to
   take [size]) or in whatever invariant ilock establishes.

   is in [cov]; what is missing is one PURE geometry fact relating [cov] to
   the file system's size -- of exactly the same character as
   [LogInv.log_geom_ok], and supplied from the same place.  With it the
   owed premise is a two-line corollary and no invariant moves.

   It is true by construction: [FsBoot.fs_cov_in cov ndisk] already bounds
   every covered block by the disk image's length, and [size] is [sb.size],

   between them"; [k ∉ dom M] means the slot is FREE.

   The frac x count pairing is the whole trick and it is what the design
   note calls REF-1 EXCLUSIVITY: [fracR] has no unit and [positiveR] has no
   zero, so [Some (q,1) ≼ Some (qt,n)] forces [n = 1 -> q = qt].  A thread

  (*  THE LIVENESS POOL, SLOT BY SLOT (design §14.6)                     *)
  (* ================================================================== *)

  (* WHERE SLOT [k]'s ONE UNIT IS.  A FREE slot's WHOLE unit sits here, in
     the invariant, and that IS the support clause -- OWNED rather than
     asserted, which is what lets a lock-free share-holder conclude
     [k ∈ dom M] ([live_slot_live]) with no [dom]-inclusion side condition
     anywhere.  A LIVE slot's unit is split [qt] to the reference holders
     (inside their [iref_tok]s, canonically paired -- see [IcacheRef.v]'s
     header) and [1 - qt] to this arm.

     THAT SPLIT IS WHAT RETIRES THE POOL AT THE LAST CLOSE: the closer's own
     slice is the whole [qt] (REF-1), the arm is [1 - qt], and they join to
     the entire unit -- exactly a free slot's shape.  §14.6's "mass
     conservation IS the witness", as four lines of [Qp] arithmetic
     ([live_slot_close_last]).

     THE [None] ARM IS [False], for [islot_rest_at]'s reason (§13.8): it
     makes "the outstanding total is strictly below one" RESOURCE-CARRIED,
     so no wf clause has to mention fractions and every step re-establishes
     it automatically.

     ---- THE RESTATED LEDGER (§17.2 piece 4, as repaired by §17.3 (A)) ----

     A LIVE slot's unit is now split THREE ways, not two:

         1  =  qt (the reference holders and their shares)
             + ½  (the ESCROW ARM, at the slot's generation)
             + (½ - qt) (this arm)

     so the live case below is [1/2 - qt], which is [islot_rest_at]'s shape
     EXACTLY -- the liveness ledger and the identity ledger became the same
     shape, and that congruence is the real endorsement of the restatement.
     A FREE slot's WHOLE unit still sits here: the escrow's EMPTY arm holds
     no slice, which is what keeps [live_slot_live] (and therefore
     [iref_live_load_au], ilock's [ref < 1] guard) exactly as it was.

     §17.2 put the ½ in [ic_loaded], i.e. in the CHECKED-OUT thread's hand;
     §17.3 (A) showed that kills [IcacheEscrow.ic_open_auth_ref]'s REF-1
     refutation of the OUT arm, because the invariant's arm is then
     no longer the exact complement of what the opener holds.  With the ½ in
     the ARM, every live arm an opener can meet holds the exact complement
     again, and [live_whole_share_absurd] merely gains a [live_frac k (1/2)]
     premise that the opener supplies from the arm it has just destructed. *)
  (* ---- RULING R-e (iclaim-ledger.md §5⁗⁗): the arm is a DISJUNCTION ----

     The ORDINARY alternative is exactly what the three-way split above
     describes and is what every landed move reads.  The FROZEN one holds the
     slot's WHOLE unit -- the freezer's own [qt], the escrow arm's ½ and this
     arm's own [½ - qt], joined at iput's mint inside the one [itable_inv]
     opening [live_slot_regen] already takes -- and it is what R-e buys:

       * a reader with the escrow tail's [frzsel] half and ANY positive
         [live_frac k s'] kills it by [live_frac_full_excl], with NO lock, NO
         licence, NO region open and NO index ([frz_slot_kill]) -- which is
         ProofIlock:2422 and ProofIdup's decider, both;
       * the mass is NOT in anybody's hand for the whole lock-free span, so
         that span's foreign readers see the invariant and nothing else.

     THE SELECTOR ([IcacheRef.frzsel]) is what makes the disjunction DECIDE,
     and its ledger is:

       FREE            this arm 1  false
       LIVE, unfrozen  this arm ½  false  +  [frz_park]'s OFF arm  ½ false
       LIVE, frozen    this arm ½  true   +  the escrow's frozen tail ½ true

     so the two weapons are (i) any positive live slice, which refutes the
     frozen alternative outright, and (ii) the OFF half, which refutes it by
     [IcacheRef.frzsel_agree] -- and (ii) is what the LICENSED up-count needs,
     being the one mover that holds no live slice of its own (see
     [iref_incr_step]).

     [1/2 - qt] is factored OUT of the disjunction, so both alternatives carry
     it: the retirement still needs it, and the frozen alternative would
     otherwise lose the [q < 1/2] budget the reclaim reads. *)

     an opaque word with bounds: the lock's half pins the authority, so the
     map inside the invariant IS [M] ([itable_half_agree]) and the word the
     [lw] sees is [iref_word M k].  That is what makes the [addiw] between

  (*  THE SHARE'S SIDE (design §14.6; C8/B2's ilock, B3's idup)          *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* THE LOCK-FREE GUARD READ, FOR A HOLDER THAT HAS NO REFERENCE.
     [iref_load_au] is the same read for a reference holder, and it gets its
     liveness from [iref_lookup] -- a count fragment names its own slot in
     [M].  A SHARE cannot: [positiveR] has no zero (design §14.5), so a
     share carries no fragment at all.  What it carries is a slice of the
     slot's liveness unit, and the invariant's own arm at a FREE slot is the
     WHOLE unit -- so the slice's mere existence refutes freeness
     ([live_pool_live]).  That is the pool's entire reason to exist.

     [k < NINODE] is a PREMISE here where [iref_load_au] derived it from
     [icM_wf], for the same reason: a share names no map entry until the
     pool has spoken.  Every caller has it from the entry address. *)
  (* the generation-named twin, for [SpecIlock] v4 (design §17.3 (A)): its
     caller's share names the slot's generation, and [live_frac]'s
     existential is not re-introducible once opened. *)




  (* NO SHARE CAN COEXIST WITH A HOLDER OF THE SLOT'S WHOLE OUTSTANDING MASS
     (design §14.8's corrected REF-1 refutation).

     §14.6 stated iput's refutation of a share-shaped escrow arm over IDENTITY
     mass, and that does not close: in the checked-out state the arm holds only
     the share's [s] of each identity cell (the parked ½ is in the CHECKED-OUT
     THREAD's hand -- SpecIlock hands it out), so the sum never passes one.
     The LIVE mass does close, and this is it: a reference holder whose own
     [q] IS the map's [qt] (which is what REF-1 gives, [iref_lookup]) carries
     [live_frac k qt]; the invariant's arm at a live slot is exactly the
     complement [1 - qt] ([live_slot]); the two are already the WHOLE unit, so
     any further slice at all is over budget.

     Stated as a fupd because [live_slot] lives inside [itable_inv] and the
     opener is holding no piece of it -- which is why [IcacheEscrow]'s two
     authority-side openers had to become fupds too.  The count is irrelevant
     here: what does the work is [q = qt], not [n = 1]. *)

  (* THE SECOND GENERATION BUMP (design §17.6, ratified §17.7) -- and it is
     [live_whole_share_absurd] read in the POSITIVE direction.

     A generation may see AT MOST ONE FILL, or the type witness it carries is
     not a function of the generation.  iget's recycle gives the FIRST fill
     its own generation ([live_slot_alloc]); §17.6.1 exhibits a REACHABLE
     second one -- iput's free path re-parks UNLOADED, ialloc's claim retags
     the very same inum through the buffer, its [iget] hits the still-cached
     entry, and [ProofIlock]'s third fill branch completes on the marker.  So
     the free path must RETIRE the generation before it re-parks.

     A bump needs the slot's WHOLE unit, and this is the second (and last)
     instant at which it exists: at iput's REF-1 free window the closer's [qt]
     is its own ([iref_lookup] off [M !! k = Some (qt, n)]), the escrow arm's
     1/2 is in its hand (handed out with the payload by [ic_open_auth_ref],
     since [ic_held] holds no slice -- §17.5's forced deviation), and the
     table's [1/2 - qt] is in [live_slot].  Those are exactly the three
     summands [live_whole_share_absurd] adds to a contradiction; here they are
     added to ONE and spent on [live_frac_bump].

     THE COUNT [n] IS A PARAMETER THIS LEMMA NEVER READS, exactly as in
     [live_whole_share_absurd]: REF-1 is only how the caller comes to know
     [q = qt].  And the itable lock -- held by iput from its [acquire] through
     +0x5c, with this call inside that window -- is what makes the bump
     airtight: every reference minted afterwards, INCLUDING the claim's, is
     minted at the new generation, and every reference that existed before is
     refuted by REF-1.

     [live_slot]'s text does not move: it is stated over [live_frac], whose
     generation is existential, so the table's remainder simply comes back
     naming [g'] instead of [g]. *)


  (* THE SAME FACT FOR A LOCK HOLDER -- origin's [iref_share_lookup], ported.
     Theirs read a count-0 fragment against [itable_half] and needed no
     invariant; ours is a pool slice, so it opens [itable_inv] (and closes it
     again immediately -- no cell moves).  idup's [lw]/[sw] pair needs
     exactly this and nothing more. *)
  (* the same look with the slice's (g, lo) identity preserved -- what a
     floored credential's holder runs (A6.145). *)


  (* A6.145: pin an outstanding liveness slice to the zero epoch through
     [itable_inv] alone -- no [itable_half] needed, since the pool row is
     indexed by the slot, not the map. *)


  (* ...the short-parent-shaped one, same move. *)


  (* ...and the share-shaped wrapper: a generation-named share, back from
     iunlock floor-free, becomes the ERASED (floored) [inode_shr] -- the form
     [inode_refp_gather] and every bundle constructor consume. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
  (*  THE FROZEN PARK (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, RULING A⁗; ZZProbeFrz)     *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s LIVE arm carries this disjunction at the arm's
     own table share [q].  Its left alternative is the ordinary state (the
     mirror down, nothing parked); its right one is THE FROZEN PARK, minted
     by [ip_free_entry] at +0x50 under the FIRST itable-lock hold out of the
     freezer's own holdings -- [iref_tok k q] carries [live_frac k q] by
     definition and the payload checkout carries the [1/2] -- and reclaimed
     by the last close at +0x8a.

     WHY AT THE MINT AND NOT LATER, which is the whole of A⁗ over A‴: those
     two slices are NOT idle after +0x5e (the deposit scatters them into the
     escrow's OUT arm, and +0x76 hands the reference back to the freezer's
     hand while the itable lock is not even held).  At +0x50 they are both in
     one hand, so the park is buildable exactly there and nowhere else.

     WHAT IT BUYS: the arm becomes a BRANCH the region's mirror clause
     selects, so (a) the mint decides it LEFT from its own mass with no open
     at all, (b) the +0x8a close decides it RIGHT off [ifreeze_pre], and (c)
     a foreign up-count at a frozen inum inherits [live_whole_share_absurd]'s
     contradiction, which is [ProofIdup]'s OPEN(2.6b). *)
  (* THE PARKED SLICE IS STATED AT [q] FROM BELOW, and that is not slack:
     [islot2]'s live arm re-parks at a MOVED [q] at two of the five count
     movers, and only one of them (the up-count) can pay for a decision.  The
     ordinary close shrinks [q] and rides through by [frz_park_mono]; the mint
     parks at exactly [q = qt], so the bound is tight where 2.6b reads it. *)
  (* ---- RULING R-e: THE PARK IS NOW A MIRROR AND A SELECTOR, NO MASS ----

     A⁗ put the freezer's two live slices HERE, in [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s
     live arm, i.e. on the ITABLE-LOCK side -- and §5⁗″.2 then found that
     ProofIlock's checkout, which holds no lock, cannot reach them.  R-e moves
     the mass into [live_slot]'s frozen alternative (above), where a
     lock-free reader meets it by opening [itable_inv] alone.  What stays here
     is the MIRROR BIT and the SELECTOR's other half:

       OFF   [frzm_h z false] ∗ [frzsel k ½ false]
       ON    [frzm_h z true ] ∗ [frzsel k (½/2) true]

     and the ON arm's quarter is exactly what the +0x82 reclaim brings home,
     to be joined with the escrow tail's at the +0x8a retirement.

     THE PARK CARRIES NO MASS, so it is indexed by the slot and the inum
     alone -- [islot2]'s live arm re-parks it across every count move with no
     accompanying fraction. *)
  (* F42/F42′ (tso-cutover endgame §6¹²–§6¹⁶): the window pin AT REST --
     main's [hpn] register whole at [None] -- rides the TABLE ROW, here, and
     only while the mirror bit is DOWN.  iput's guard (a) and iget's recycler
     (a) both hold the row (itable.lock) when they must PRODUCE the box's
     OUT_L1 residue, which is why it cannot ride the header (inside the box
     until (a) opens it).  Bit UP -- iput's free window, from the release
     after (g) to the last close -- the two halves are where the free path
     put them: one in the header's frozen alternative ([ic_pin_tx]), one in
     iput's hand. *)

       [Hhalf] [itable_half Mt]               the itable lock

(* WHY THESE FIVE LIVE IN THEIR OWN SECTION.  Since §2.2 every count move
   has to reach the [icnt] half that rides in [InodeRegion.ireg_slot], so
   these wrappers -- and only these -- need the region's typeclass context
   ([iregG], [fsLogG], [diskGhostG], [logG]).  Keeping them apart is what
   stops every landed consumer of [iref_load_au] / [iref_share_lookup_au] /
   [live_slot_regen] from gaining four instance premises it has no use for.

   THE MASK, AND WHY IT COSTS NOTHING (§2.9, probed).  Every count move in
   the tree is a [ref]-word store through [WpAu4.wp_sw_au_s_sconf], whose
   outer mask is HARD-CODED at [⊤ ∖ ↑minstretN] and whose hole [Em] is the
   caller's to choose subject to [↑kptN ⊆ Em].  So [↑iregN] is available at
   every site by the store rule's own signature, and no invariant can be held
   open across one of these instructions (the rule concludes a WP at the full
   mask).  The hole widens from [⊤ ∖ ↑minstretN ∖ ↑icacheN] to
   [⊤ ∖ ↑minstretN ∖ ↑icacheN ∖ ↑iregN] and every side condition still goes
   by [solve_ndisj].  The §13.1-style lock-held-auth indirection is NOT
   needed and is strictly worse (probe §2e).

   WHAT THE REGION OPEN HAS TO GIVE BACK is one pure clause,
   [InodeRegion.ireg_frz_ok f m] at the NEW count -- §2.3's phased freeze
   pin.  Three of these five discharge it from a token the mover already has
   to hold, one discharges it from arithmetic, and the fifth STEPS the phase:

     [iref_dup_store_au] / [iref_incr_store_au] / [iref_upgrade_store_au]
       count goes UP, so [FrzPre] (which pins it at one) is not refutable by
       arithmetic and has to be refuted by exclusivity: the mover presents
       the inum's "right to freeze" [ifreeze_off], which pins f at [FrzOff],
       at which the clause is vacuous.  That token is §2.6's currency and it
       comes back out untouched.
     [iref_close_store_au]
       count goes from [Pos.succ n >= 2] DOWN, and both frozen phases pin it
       at one or zero -- so f is [None] or [FrzOff] by arithmetic alone
       ([ireg_frz_ok_ge2]) and the mover needs no token at all.
     [iref_close_last_store_au]
       the 1 -> 0 move, the ONLY one that runs with a freeze possibly HELD
       (iput's free path mints at +0x50 and retires at the deposit, so +0x8a
       is strictly inside the window -- this is exactly what refuted §2.3's
       original strict [icnt = 1] clause).  It threads the freeze token and
       steps its phase [FrzPre -> FrzPost] inside the region open it already
       takes, which re-establishes the pin at zero.  [FrzOff] passes through
       unchanged, which is what lets the ORDINARY last close (ref 1, nlink
       nonzero -- no freeze anywhere) use the same lemma. *)

     [InodeRegion.ireg_frzc] pins the region's mirror half to the column
     ([ireg_frzm_ok]), so a slot at [ph] carries the bit [frz_bit ph].  The
     LOCK's half rides in [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s live arm, where it selects
     the frozen-park disjunct, and in the free pool's bundle at [false].

     The phase-step accessor below therefore has to TRADE that half at the one
     step where it moves, and at no other -- written in the "[emp] where the
     resource is not in play" style, so that every caller whose phase is not
     [FrzPre] passes and receives nothing and its signature is unchanged in
     substance.  The two directions are not
     symmetric because the accessor NEVER MINTS a freeze (that is
     [InodeRegion.ireg_freeze_au]'s, which holds the itable lock AND the
     region open, the only combination [frzm_update] admits): so the half
     comes IN only at [ph = FrzPre] and goes back OUT at the phase the step
     lands on, whatever that is. *)

  (* THE SAME OPEN, WITH A LICENCE IN HAND -- and this is the shape the
     UP-COUNTS take since RULING A (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, A-custody +
     A-AUs).

     WHY THEY CANNOT TAKE THE TOKEN.  Increment II gave the three
     incrementers an [ifreeze_off] premise, on the theory that the unfrozen
     token rides under the itable lock beside the [icnt] half.  IIIb proved
     that false in both directions: a CACHED inum has no freeze token
     anywhere in the tree (Consequence 2), and the custody ruling then put
     the token in the PAYLOAD holder's hand -- which at an increment is the
     freezer's hand, not the incrementer's.  An [iget] cache-hit at an inum
     iput is freeing must be REFUTED, not served, so it cannot be asked to
     produce the very token that refutation would require.

     WHAT THEY TAKE INSTEAD is the licence [SpecIget] already demands: every
     iget in the tree presents one ([IgetLic.iname]), and §2.6's table --
     now [IgetLic.iname_not_frozen] -- turns any of the five into
     [f = FrzOff] with the region open.  Borrowed and handed straight back,
     like every other reading of a licence.  At [FrzOff] the pin is vacuous
     at ANY new count, so the continuation carries no obligation at all --
     which is why this accessor's wand, unlike the two above, takes nothing
     but the count. *)

  (* THE SAME OPEN, WITH THE MIRROR's [false] HALF IN HAND -- the
     LICENCE-FREE up-count RULING A⁗ buys (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, closing
     §3.11's OPEN(2.6b)).

     §3.11's wall was that idup's two call sites are both [idup(p->cwd)] and
     a cwd holder can present no licence at any of the five constructors (xv6
     permits unlinking a process's cwd, so it is not even [nlink <> 0]), while
     the arithmetic route needs [2 <= n] and a cwd held by one process sits at
     exactly the count [FrzPre] admits.

     A⁗'s answer is neither: the mover presents the LOCK's own mirror half,
     which it peels out of [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s live arm and which it can
     only have at [false] (the [true] alternative carries the freezer's parked
     live mass, and that is what collides with the mover's own share -- see
     [iref_upgrade_park_store_au], which does that half of the case split
     OUTSIDE this open).  At [false] the column is not [FrzPre]; the live
     arm's count is one or more, so [FrzPost]'s pin is refuted too; and
     [FrzOff]'s pin is vacuous at any new count, so the continuation carries
     no obligation -- exactly [ireg_icnt_lic_acc]'s shape, with the licence
     swapped for a resource a cwd holder actually has. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* THE WRITE.  The [sw] and the ghost step happen in the SAME invariant
     opening, which is the whole reason the read-modify-write is atomic in
     the proof: the lock's half stops any other thread moving [M], and the
     two halves meet only here, which is exactly the moment the physical
     word changes.  [Hno] -- that the incremented count is still an [int] --
     is what re-establishes [icM_wf]; it is NOT provable here and comes from
     the caller's [IrefSlots.iref_slots_no_overflow].

     SINCE §2.2 the LEDGER moves in the same breath: the slot's [icnt] half
     goes in at [Pos.to_nat n] and comes back at [Pos.to_nat (Pos.succ n)],
     and the region's half moves with it inside a nested [↑iregN] open.

     THE LICENCE, NOT THE TOKEN (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, RULING A -- this
     SUPERSEDES increment II's [ifreeze_off] premise; see
     [ireg_icnt_lic_acc]'s header for why the token is unpresentable here).
     The mover borrows the caller's [IgetLic.iname], refutes both frozen
     phases inside the region open with §2.6's table, and hands the licence
     straight back. *)


  (* THE SAME WRITE, FOR AN INCREMENTER THAT HOLDS NO REFERENCE.
     [iref_dup_store_au] above is idup's shape: a caller token goes in and
     two halves come out.  [iget]'s cache-HIT arm has no token of its own --
     it found the entry by SCANNING -- so the new reference cannot be split
     off anything the opener brought, and is minted from the share the TABLE
     retained instead ([islot_rest_at], design §13.1b/§13.1e).  That is
     exactly [iref_incr_step] rather than [iref_dup_step], and it is why the
     entry's outstanding fraction GROWS by [qn] here where it stayed put in
     idup.  BioInv's [bio_incr_step] and its store wrapper are the precedent.

     Both side conditions are the CALLER's, for the same reasons as above:
     [✓ (qt + qn)] is the fraction budget (the caller takes [qn] out of the
     table's [1/2 - qt], so the sum never passes 1/2), and [Hno] -- that the
     incremented count is still an [int] -- comes from
     [IrefSlots.iref_slots_no_overflow] exactly as in ProofIdup.

     THE LEDGER SIDE is [iref_dup_store_au]'s verbatim: half in, half out,
     the caller's LICENCE (not a freeze token -- RULING A) refuting both
     phases across the increment. *)

  (* THE LICENCE-FREE UP-COUNT (iclaim-ledger.md §3.13's delivery, on A⁗'s
     mechanism): [iref_incr_store_au] verbatim with [ireg_icnt_lic_acc]
     swapped for [ireg_icnt_mir_acc], and the caller's SHARE carried through
     as in [iref_upgrade_store_au].

     What the mover presents in place of a licence is the LOCK's own mirror
     half at [false], which it peels out of [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s live arm
     and decides with [frz_park_shr_off] -- its own share against the parked
     mass.  That is why this is idup's mover: [idup(p->cwd)] can produce no
     [iname] (xv6 permits unlinking a process's cwd, so not even
     [nlink <> 0]) and the arithmetic route wants [2 <= n], while a cwd held
     by one process sits at exactly the count [FrzPre] admits.

     ---- DELIVERY IS STILL BLOCKED, AND NOT WHERE §3.13 THOUGHT (IVd) ----

     §3.13's repair -- give [IcacheEscrow.itable_res2] a persistent
     [∃ ist, ireg_inv γi γfs ist nib] so that the handle comes DOWN out of
     the lock and [SpecIdup] stays byte-identical -- was executed and does
     not survive TYPE-CHECKING, for a reason its 11-edit costing could not
     see: [ireg_inv] is defined in [InodeRegion]'s section, whose Context is
     [!riscvGS, !diskGhostG, !fsLogG, !iregG, !icacheG, !logG], and
     [IcacheEscrow]'s main section has NO [!logG Σ].  Naming [ireg_inv] in
     [itable_res2] therefore puts [!logG Σ] on [itable_res2], hence on
     [is_itable2], hence on EVERY statement that takes it -- and
     [SpecIdup:203], [SpecKfork], [SpecSysFork] and [ProofKforkB4] all take
     [is_itable2] and none of the four carries [logG].  That is §3.11's wall
     again, one level below where §3.13 looked for it, and it breaks the
     byte-identity that was the whole point.

     The eleven edits themselves are right and were verified up to this
     point; what needs a RULING is the class hierarchy, and the cheapest
     shape is to make [logG] a FIELD of a class the cone already carries
     ([iregG], which [SpecIdup] and [SpecKfork] both have) rather than a
     separate Context entry -- at the price of removing the now-ambiguous
     [!logG Σ] from every section that also carries [!iregG Σ].  That is a
     design pass, not a convergence edit, so IVd stopped here with BOTH
     halves of the 2.6b mechanism proven and in the tree ([frz_park_shr_off]
     above and this lemma) and only their delivery to [ProofIdup] open. *)


  (* iput's [ref--] WHEN IT IS NOT THE LAST: the count goes [Pos.succ n] to
     [n] and the departing reference's fraction [q] rejoins the outstanding
     total, leaving [qr] with [qt = q + qr].  The [sw] and the ghost step
     are in ONE invariant opening, exactly as in [iref_dup_store_au] and
     for the same reason -- the lock's half pins [M] across the
     [lw; addiw; sw], and the two halves meet only here.

     There is no [Hno] side condition and there cannot be one: the count
     goes DOWN, so [icM_wf]'s bound is re-established from the bound the
     invariant already carried ([icM_wf_count] at [Pos.succ n]).  That
     asymmetry with the two increment wrappers is the whole difference.

     AND THERE IS NO FREEZE TOKEN EITHER, for a second asymmetry with them:
     this close comes in at [Pos.succ n >= 2], where BOTH phases of §2.3's
     pin are already refuted by arithmetic ([ireg_frz_ok_ge2]).  A slot at
     two or more references is not frozen and cannot become frozen under the
     lock the mover is holding, so the region clause re-establishes itself. *)


  (* iput's [ref--] WHEN IT IS THE LAST: the slot leaves [M] entirely and
     the word goes to zero, which is [iref_word]'s [None] branch -- i.e.
     the free-slot shape iget's scan looks for.  The closer must present
     the WHOLE outstanding share [qt]; REF-1 ([iref_lookup] at count one)
     is what tells it that its own [q] is that share.

     THE ONE COUNT MOVE THAT RUNS INSIDE A FREEZE WINDOW (§2.3, the probe's
     correction).  iput's free path mints the freeze in [ip_free_entry]'s
     span at +0x50 and retires it only at the +0xba deposit, so +0x8a's last
     close is strictly inside -- which is exactly why §2.3's original strict
     [icnt = 1] clause is FALSE, and why the phase is PHASED.  The token
     comes in at [ph] and goes out at [frz_close ph]: [FrzPre -> FrzPost]
     re-establishes the pin at zero, and [FrzOff] passes through, which is
     what lets the ORDINARY last close (an unfrozen slot at ref 1) use this
     same lemma with nothing new to find. *)


  (* THE FREE PATH's INSTANCE, named as the probe named it: the phase steps
     [FrzPre -> FrzPost] at iput+0x8a and the freeze stays standing for the
     off-lock deposit to retire (§1.4). *)


  (* THE UPGRADE (share -> reference), for B3's idup -- AND WHAT IT IS NOT.

     Origin's [iref_upgrade_step] moved a count-0 fragment to count 1 at the
     SAME fraction: under [natR] a share IS authority mass, so upgrading it
     conjures nothing.  Under [positiveR] it is not, and the accounting
     forbids the analogous move: the table's retained identity share is
     [1/2 - qt] against the authority's [qt] (§13.1b), so a new fragment at
     [s] must be matched by [s] of identity coming OUT OF THE TABLE.  The
     share's own [s] is already spoken for -- it is the hole in its parent's
     identity slice.  So a share cannot BECOME a reference; the fractions do
     not line up, and any lemma that claimed otherwise would have to conjure
     [s] of [i_dev]/[i_inum].

     WHAT idup ACTUALLY NEEDS is weaker and already true: the share is a
     LIVENESS WITNESS (it proves the slot is live, and it keeps it live,
     because its parent cannot close while short of identity), and the new
     reference is minted from the table's retained share exactly as iget's
     cache-hit arm mints one -- [iref_incr_store_au].  This wrapper is that
     step with the share carried through, so B3's call site reads as the
     upgrade it is: share in, share + reference out.

     The consequence for B3: idup's postcondition returns the share BESIDE
     the new reference, and kfork's parent gathers it back
     ([IcacheRef.inode_ref_gather]) instead of losing it. *)


  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
  (*  THE SIXTH MOVE: THE RECYCLE's 0 -> 1 (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, the    *)
  (*  brief's item 4; IIIb's Consequence 3)                               *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* Increment II shipped a region-aware wrapper for every count move BUT
     this one, because [iref_alloc_step] is region-blind and iget's +0x78
     did its own [itable_inv] opening inline.  Since §2.2 that is no longer
     enough: the peeled [icnt_half z 0] has to reach the slot at
     [icnt_half z 1], which is a move of the region's half and therefore a
     nested [↑iregN] open.

     THIS ONE DOES TAKE THE TOKEN, and it is the only up-count that can
     (A-custody): the recycle's inum is UNCACHED, so its [ifreeze_off] is
     exactly what the pool peel just handed the recycler, alongside the
     zero count half.  Both come back -- the token travels on into the
     entry's parked arm and the half into [islot2]'s live one.  No licence
     is needed and none would help: at an uncached inum there is no cached
     arm for the table's rows to talk about.

     The [ph] is a parameter for [iref_close_last_store_au]'s reason: the
     ORDINARY recycle threads [FrzOff] and the pin is vacuous both sides,
     while a recycle of a box whose freeze is still standing is refuted
     upstream, at the peel, and never reaches here. *)

  (* ---- THE IDENTITY BUDGET (design §13.1b, as corrected by §13.1e) ----

     The escrow's PARKED arm owns HALF of BOTH identity cells permanently.
     For [i_inum] that half is what ties the arm's [dinode_at] to the entry
     the cells name, and the ½-versus-FULL split of THAT cell is what
     distinguishes the parked arm from the recycle-window arm (§13.1c -- the
     inum cell remains the sole parked/mid discriminator).  For [i_dev] the
     half exists for a different reason, and §13.1b's "the dev cell needs no
     arm tie" was wrong: a checked-out [ilock] has deposited its WHOLE
     reference, so without a dev half handed back at checkout it could not
     read [ip->dev] for its own [bread] (ilock+0x48), and [iunlock] could not
     return the caller's reference AT THE CALLER'S DEVICE.  [BioInv]'s
     [buf_parked] holds [b_dev ↦₄{½}] for exactly these two reasons.  So the
     budget is SYMMETRIC:

         i_dev  :  1  =  ½ (the escrow, forever)
                      +  q (the references)  +  (½ - q)  (the table)
         i_inum :  1  =  ½ (the escrow, forever)
                      +  q (the references)  +  (½ - q)  (the table)

     and a reference's fraction therefore ranges in (0, ½) -- STRICTLY, and
     that is what the [None] arm below is about.  The table's retained share
     is now an [inode_ident] like every other share.

     [islot_rest_at] pins the two values (the pool's slot->inum map wants
     them pinned, §13.2); [islot_rest] is the ∃-bound form
     [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s live arm uses.

     THE [None] ARM IS [False], NOT [emp] (design §13.8, C5's blocker B).
     [None] is the [q ≥ ½] case -- the whole shared half handed out, the
     table keeping nothing of either cell.  Written [emp] that state is
     PERMITTED, and then two things become unprovable at a slot in it: iget's
     cache-hit arm, which must mint a positive identity fraction OUT of the
     retained share ([IcacheInv.iref_incr_store_au] supplies only the count
     fragment), and any plain read of [ip->dev] / [ip->inum] under the lock,
     which iget's scan does fifty times.  The state is unreachable in the
     code -- [iref_alloc_step] mints at ¼, a hit mints strictly less than the
     remainder, [iref_dup_step] does not move [q] and [iref_close_step]
     shrinks it -- but "unreachable" is not a fact any invariant here states.
     Writing [False] makes the positivity RESOURCE-CARRIED, so it is
     re-established automatically at every split and no wf clause has to
     mention fractions. *)

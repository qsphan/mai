     [ufd_l2] to [ufd_l3] -- and the two names below are the two ledgers

                refuted -- so neither of /init's dups can fail, and

  (* THE ROW BEHIND THE HEAD, AS A PURE FACT (lane IO-LEAF, step 3).  Which
     of the three arms a ledger is at is decidable from the list itself,
     and the walk between /init's banner and its fork needs to say WHICH
     arm without holding the head as a disjunction: the credential the
     banner leaves is prompt-shaped on the console arm and banner-owed on
     the closed one, and the two must be lent to the shell at the SAME
     ledger the shell will inherit.  Persistent, so a ledger opened this
     way carries its arm to wherever it is closed again. *)

(* PipeOutPure.v -- THE PIPELINE APPLICATION'S STAGE MACHINE, PURE.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-pipe.md section 4.1, lane
   PIPE-STAGE, deliverable 1.  This file is [EchoOutPure.v]'s twin at
   [PipeDisc.sessp] -- the same stage machine over the pipeline session --
   and it is SIMPLER than upstream's [FileOutPure.v], because a pipe dies
   with its era: there is NO per-era extra state, no boot value, no typed
   witness, and nothing to thread.  Where [FileOutPure] carries [fo_f0]
   through every block, this file carries nothing.

   WHAT CHANGES FROM [EchoOutPure], AND WHAT DOES NOT.

   - [pending_at_p ps cs I] and [D_p ps cs E] are [EchoOutPure.pending_at]
     and [D] at [PipeDisc.alt_cont_p]; the append laws, F1 and F2 are that
     file's, lemma for lemma.
   - the range condition that was [Forall (fun c => c < 4) cs] is
     [alts_pre_p I cs]: every entry the choice list HAS is an alternative
     the LINE AT THAT INDEX admits.  It is POINTWISE and not
     [PipeDisc.alts_ok_p], because the list runs one short at a block
     boundary (a program files its alternative at the block's FIRST byte,
     which is after the echo that completed the line).  [alts_pad_p] fills
     it out, which is what lets the determinacy theorem -- stated at a FULL
     resolution -- be applied to a stage standing at a boundary.
   - [EchoOutPure]'s [cs_ok] HAS NO TWIN, for upstream's reason exactly:
     out of range [!!!] reads [0], which decodes to [PipeDisc.PEcho 0], and
     [palt_ok (LPipe ws) (PEcho 0)] is FALSE (after PIPE-MODEL-2's ruling
     only [PEcho 3] joins a pipeline line's alternatives).  So no total
     condition on [cs] can replace it and the padding is the honest fix --
     the same route [FileOutPure] took at [ralt_ok].
   - the prologue counter is [PipeDisc.pro_idx_p] (it counts [palt_panic],
     i.e. [PEcho 3], at EITHER line shape) and the side condition is
     [pro_ok_p] / [pro_pin_p].
   - F3 is [EchoOutPure.read_window_prefix] VERBATIM: it is about the log
     and the echoed entries and names no discipline.

   DETERMINACY NEEDS NO SECOND WITNESS.  [FileDisc.sessf_prefix_det2]
   exists only because a file's transcript reads the era's BOOT STATE, and
   the discipline's witness for it and the claim's own have no reason to be
   equal.  A pipeline round reads no state at all, so
   [PipeDisc.sessp_prefix_det] IS the lemma the stage spends;
   [sessp_prefix_det2] below is its restatement under the brief's name and
   is proved by [exact].  (Reported as such.)

   THE DISCIPLINE'S CLOSURE LAWS are here too ([disc_p_out], [disc_p_in],
   [disc_p_power], [disc_p_other], [disc_p_prefix]): [PipeDisc] landed
   [disc_input_p]'s full set and, of [disc_p]'s, only [disc_p_nil] and
   [disc_p_seg]; the ledger's three steps are stated at exactly these. *)

Lemma pfree_term (a : palt) : negb (palt_isforkS a) = true -> palt_isforkS a = false.
Proof using. destruct (palt_isforkS a); [discriminate | reflexivity]. Qed.

Lemma pfree_of_nofork (a : palt) : palt_isforkS a = false -> negb (palt_isforkS a) = true.
Proof using. intros ->. reflexivity. Qed.

Lemma pcont_nonnil_dec (l : pline) (a : palt) :
  palt_ok l a \/ a = palt_of 0%nat -> pcont l a <> [].
Proof using.
  rewrite (palt_of_lt4 0%nat ltac:(lia)). exact (pcont_nonnil l a).
Qed.

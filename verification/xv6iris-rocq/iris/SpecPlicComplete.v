(* SpecPlicComplete.v -- the public interface of plic_complete.
   [plic_complete] (xv6-riscv/kernel/plic.c) tells the PLIC that this hart has
   finished serving the interrupt whose id it is handed:

     0x800054ec <plic_complete>:
       ...prologue (32-byte frame: ra, s0, s1)...
       mv     s1,a0            save the irq argument
       jal    cpuid            a0 = hart id
       slliw  a5,a0,0xd
       lui    a4,0xc201
       add    a5,a5,a4         a5 = PLIC + 0x201000 + hart*0x2000
       sw     s1,4(a5)         *PLIC_SCLAIM(hart) = irq
       ...epilogue...

   Like plicinithart, this runs on every hart concurrently, so it takes the
   device invariant [dev_inv] (WpUart.v) rather than owning [plic_frag], and
   each store opens it -- see SpecPlicinithart.v for why.

   AS FAR AS THE KERNEL'S PLIC PLAN GOES, plic_complete IS A NO-OP: the model's
   completion write only clears a [p_claimed] bit, and [plic_ok] (PlicPlan.v)
   constrains only the per-hart enable words.  So there is nothing to say about
   the PLIC on either side of the call, and correspondingly no constraint on
   the irq argument: the model's sclaim write is total, an out-of-range id
   simply completes nothing.  What the spec still earns is that the store
   ADDRESS decodes to this hart's real claim/complete register, which is what
   pins the precondition [bv_unsigned tp < dev_ncpu].

   Requires only the definitional layer + SpecCpuid -- never a whole-function
   proof file. *)

(* INTERRUPTS MUST BE DISABLED.  plic_complete's second instruction is an
   unbracketed [jal cpuid] (after [c.mv s1,a0] merely saves the argument) --
   there is no push_off/pop_off anywhere in its body -- and [cpuid]'s own
   contract (SpecCpuid.v) is [b = false]-ONLY (it reads [tp] mid-body; see the
   porting guide, "A function that READS tp mid-body must be stated at b =
   false"). A caller-supplied [b] cannot meet that precondition, so
   plic_complete itself can only be called with interrupts already off. This
   holds transitively at every real call site: plic_complete runs from
   devintr(), reached only from {user,kernel}trap() before interrupts are
   turned back on (usertrap's [intr_on()] sits in the syscall arm, never the
   device-interrupt arm; kerneltrap() PANICS if interrupts are found enabled,
   "kerneltrap: interrupts enabled") -- see
   claude-notes/projects/explicit-cpuid-porting-guide.md. So the contract is
   stated at the literal index [false] rather than a generic [b], with no
   [wp_next] wrapper (it would collapse via [wp_next_off] anyway, since the
   hart cannot move). *)

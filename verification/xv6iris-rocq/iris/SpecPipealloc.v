(* SpecPipealloc.v -- the public interface of pipealloc, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int pipealloc(struct file **f0, struct file **f1) {
       struct pipe *pi = 0;
       f0[0] = f1[0] = 0;
       if ((f0[0] = filealloc()) == 0 || (f1[0] = filealloc()) == 0) goto bad;
       if ((pi = (struct pipe * ) kalloc()) == 0)                     goto bad;

       f0[0]->type = FD_PIPE; f0[0]->readable = 1;
       f0[0]->writable = 0;   f0[0]->pipe = pi;
       f1[0]->type = FD_PIPE; f1[0]->readable = 0;
       f1[0]->writable = 1;   f1[0]->pipe = pi;

     bad:
       if (pi) kfree((char * ) pi);
       if (f0[0]) fileclose(f0[0]);
       if (f1[0]) fileclose(f1[0]);
       return -1;
     }

   (the [f0[0]] spelling is just to keep the C out of Rocq's comment lexer)

   pipealloc is the sole constructor of a pipe, and it is where the two halves
   of the model meet: the two exclusive [file_ref]s filealloc hands back (which
   is what licenses the eight unlocked stores into the two [struct file]s), and
   the fresh page kalloc hands back, which becomes the pipe.  It is also where
   a file's PAYLOAD is PUBLISHED: the [sd] that writes [f->pipe] is the moment
   the file starts owning one end, and pipealloc installs the pipe's ghost
   names in the slot's payload-names field ([FileInv.fpay_tok_update]) as it
   does so -- legal with no lock in hand precisely because it holds the only
   reference.  So the two ends do NOT come out separately: each is inside its
   own [file_ref], which is what makes the caller's descriptors mean
   something, and what hands the last [fileclose] a whole end to close.

   Two things worth reading off the disassembly rather than the C:

   * the [if (pi) kfree(...)] arm is DEAD and gcc removed it -- every path that
     reaches [bad] has pi = 0 -- so pipealloc never frees a pipe, and none of
     the page-reclamation question (see PipeInv.v's header) touches this proof;
   * on the [bad] paths the two [struct file *] cells are NOT restored: the
     second-filealloc failure leaves a stale non-null pointer in [*f0], and the
     kalloc failure leaves stale pointers in both.  So the failure
     postcondition promises the cells back, and nothing about their contents.

   pipealloc holds no lock across a call and acquires none itself, so the
   [cpu_own] level [n] and [C] come back untouched; its callees
   (filealloc / kalloc / initlock / fileclose) are each push/pop balanced.

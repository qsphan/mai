     sleeplocked_q γ q slk pid
                     -- WHAT IT MEANS TO HOLD THE SLEEPLOCK AT [slk]: the
                        ownership token carrying the FRACTION its holder
                        deposited, AND the lock's [pid] field, at [pid]
     sleeplocked γ slk pid
                     -- the same with the fraction forgotten; what a client
                        that does not track holders says
     sl_res_gen       -- the resource protected by the INNER spinlock:
                        ∃ v, locked word ↦₄ v ∗
                          (v = 0 ∗ sl_free_hold γ slk ∗ R
                           ∨ v ≠ 0 ∗ ∃ q, sl_hauth γ q ∗ H q)
     is_sleeplock_gen -- the sleeplock's name + the inner spinlock (is_lock,
                        named "sleep lock") protecting it  (persistent)

   When the sleeplock word is 0 (free) the inner critical section holds the
   token together with the pid field (pinned 0: both initsleeplock and
   releasesleep write it back to 0), and the protected resource R;
   acquiresleep takes both out and re-closes with the "held" disjunct, so the
   HOLDER of a sleeplock carries [sleeplocked_q γ q slk pid ∗ R] -- the pid
   field rides with the holder exactly like the spinlock's cpu word rides with
   the caller.  The held disjunct records the word's non-zeroness in the shape
   the c.beqz/c.bnez tests consume.

   THE pid FIELD IS INSIDE THE TOKEN, and that is the point of the pairing
   rather than an implementation detail.  It is written exactly twice (to
   [myproc()->pid] by acquiresleep, back to 0 by releasesleep), read by
   holdingsleep and by nobody else, and it moves between the free arm and the
   holder in lockstep with the ghost.  As a separate row it was threaded by
   every client from the buffer cache up to sys_unlink, each of which had to
   name which pid was in it and hand it back beside the token; there is no
   state in which one travels without the other.  [sleeplocked_q_pid] is the
   accessor the two stores use.

   ==================================================================== *)
(*  THE HOLDER DEPOSIT [H], AND WHAT IT BUYS: A NON-BLOCKING acquiresleep.

   The held disjunct used to be PURE ([⌜v ≠ 0⌝] and nothing else), and that
   is exactly why no caller could ever prove a sleeplock FREE.  Anything a
   would-be acquirer can learn about the lock it learns by opening the inner
   spinlock, and a purely pure held arm says only "the word is nonzero",
   which is not refutable from outside.

   THE REFUTATION HAS TO COST THE ACQUIRER SOMETHING, and that is forced, not
   a design choice.  Suppose the held arm's resources could be manufactured
   from the free arm's alone.  A client's evidence [P] that the lock is free
   must satisfy [P ∗ (held arm) ⊢ False]; but [P] is a frame for the acquire's
   ghost step, and a frame-preserving update from the free arm to the held arm
   would then carry [P] across it -- so [P ∗ (held arm)] is consistent after
   all.  The acquirer must therefore bring a resource of its OWN and leave it
   in the lock: [H q], the DEPOSIT.

   So [sl_res_gen] is indexed by [H : Qp -> iProp Σ] and acquiresleep's
   contract consumes [H q] where releasesleep's hands it back.  Two
   instantiations exist:

     [sl_untracked] (= fun _ => emp) -- the ordinary sleeplock.  Nothing is
        deposited, nothing can be refuted, no caller pays anything, and
        [is_sleeplock] / [sl_res] / [new_sleeplock] are its shorthands, so
        every existing client reads exactly as before.

     [slh_tok γ] -- the TRACKED sleeplock.  [slh_tok γ q] is a q-share of the
        "somebody may hold this sleeplock" right, [slh_auth γ t] is the total
        outstanding, and [slh_auth γ None] -- the AUTHORITATIVE ZERO -- says
        no share exists anywhere, hence no deposit, hence the held arm is
        refuted and the lock is FREE.  That is the premise the non-blocking
        acquiresleep takes in place of a lock-order bound
        (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md).

   WHY THE SHARE IS A FRACTION rather than a whole token: one inode reference
   can be shared by many [struct file]s, all of which may race for the inode's
   sleeplock, so the right to attempt the lock has to split along with the
   reference.  [ufrac] (unbounded fractions) rather than [frac] because the
   total is a sum over however many references exist and is not capped at 1.

   WHY THE DEPOSITED FRACTION IS PINNED: the holder's token carries [q] and
   agrees with the [sl_hauth] authority that rides with the deposit, so a
   releaser recovers EXACTLY the share it put in.  Handing back "some"
   fraction would leave a client whose reference is itself split unable to
   rebuild its own share.

  (*  WHAT IT MEANS TO HOLD A SLEEPLOCK: THE TOKEN *AND* THE pid FIELD.

     [lk->pid] is not a resource a holder should have to manage.  It is
     written exactly twice -- to [myproc()->pid] by acquiresleep and back to
     0 by releasesleep -- it is readable by holdingsleep and by nobody else,
     and it moves between the lock's free arm and the holder in lockstep
     with the ghost token.  Carrying it separately meant every client from
     the buffer cache to sys_unlink threaded a second row that says nothing
     it did not already know, and had to be reminded which pid was in it.

     So it lives here.  [sleeplocked_q γ q slk pid] is "I hold the sleeplock
     at [slk], I deposited [q], and its pid field says [pid]" -- one row.
     [sleeplocked_q_pid] is the accessor the two stores use.

     WHY TWO EXTRA ARGUMENTS AND NOT ONE.  [pid] is the interesting one, but
     [sl_pid] is an ADDRESS computed from the lock's own, and nothing ties
     the gname to the address: [is_sleeplock_gen] relates them, but it is
     persistent and a holder need not have it in hand.  Tying them would
     mean a second persistent agreement ghost minted at construction, to
     save an argument every use site already has in scope. *)

     [new_sleeplock_gen] allocates the gname itself, which is right for a

     OTHER resources have to mention the gname cannot use it: the icache's
     [iref_tok k q] carries [slh_tok (icfg_isl k) q], so [icfg_isl] has to
     exist -- and be fixed in the ambient config -- before any inode
     sleeplock is built (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md, step 4).

     So the ghost is separable: allocate it, put the names where they belong,
     and build each lock AT the gname it was given.  [sl_free_tok γ] is
     exactly what an unbuilt lock's free arm wants, which is why it is the

  (* ---- the two ends of initsleeplock, bundled.

     A caller that initializes ONE sleeplock names the six struct fields and
     the six results individually (as [SpecInitsleeplock.v] does).  A caller
     that initializes an ARRAY of them -- binit over bcache.buf[], iinit over
     itable.inode[] -- must not: its pre/postcondition would be a big-sep of
     six-field tuples with six existentially quantified contents each.  So the
     two ends get names: [sl_raw slk] is an uninitialized sleeplock (all six
     cells, contents arbitrary) and [sl_fresh slk s] is initsleeplock's result
     (the four zeroed cells plus the two persistent names).  [sl_fresh] is
     exactly [new_sleeplock]'s premises minus the resource, so a caller turns
     an array of them into an array of sleeplocks one [sl_fresh_new] at a
     time. *)

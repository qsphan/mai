(* SpecUsertrap.v -- the public interface of usertrap() (trap.c), stated

   ==== THIS CONTRACT IS IN THE KERNEL TIER, NOT THE TRAMPOLINE'S ========

   The first statement of this file (10892e92) read the boundary off the two
   trampoline halves: it took [tlb_inv_pt kroot], the parked user table, the
   36 trapframe words at the PHYSICAL tier, and [user_cfg].  That is uservec's
   postcondition verbatim, and it cannot be usertrap's precondition, because
   every function usertrap CALLS describes the same objects one tier up and
   the two descriptions are not merely different -- together they are
   UNSATISFIABLE.  Three collisions, one shape (see
   claude-notes/projects/usertrap.md for the long form):

   * THE KERNEL PAGE TABLE.  [tlb_inv_pt kroot] owns [ptree_own 2 1] of the
     kernel tree; the kernel cone reaches the same tree through
     [IntrDefs.sie_cap]'s [strans_inv], whose KPT arm is
     [KptShare.tlb_res_pt], which carries the INVARIANT [kpt_inv root] that
     holds it.  Hold both and one [iInv kptN] gives two exclusive owners of
     one tree, i.e. [False] -- and every leaf's [sr_absorb] opens [kptN], so
     the interior would go through BY ABSURDITY.  usertrap never writes satp
     (only the trampoline halves do), so it has no business owning a tree:
     the kernel table reaches it the way it reaches every other kernel
     function, inside [usertrap_res].  The exclusive/shared seam belongs to
     uservec/userret, which is the only code that needs exclusivity, and
     closing it is completed/kpt-share.md's named follow-up.
   * THE TRAPFRAME PAGE.  [ProcInv.proc_priv] -- which every callee below
     takes, and which usertrap itself needs for [p->trapframe->epc] -- owns
     that page as [tf_page] at the VA tier.  So the words are NOT in this
     contract; the physical<->VA crossing belongs on the trampoline side,
     where the mapping is in scope.
   * [user_cfg]'s mie/mideleg/menvcfg cells ARE [sconf]'s cells, so they ride
     inside [usertrap_res] too.  The one config cell that stays here is the
     one usertrap WRITES: [stvec].

   ==== THE ENTRY PAYLOAD IS prepare_return'S EXIT PAYLOAD ===============

   What is left once those three are out is exactly the state
   [SpecPrepareReturn.v]'s postcondition hands over, with the trap's own
   writes applied -- which is the check that this boundary is the right one:

     stvec at TRAMPOLINE with NO [intr_res] (no kernel handler installed);
     the [sie_gname] 1/4 that lived in [intr_res] still DANGLING; the KPT
     receipt loose; the sret mirror at (SPP = User, SPIE = 1) -- prepare_return
     wrote that pair, the [sret] set SIE := SPIE = 1, and the trap set
     SPP := User, SPIE := SIE = 1, so it comes back UNCHANGED; mstatus with
     SIE = 0 again (prepare_return's [intr_off] cleared it, the sret set it,
     the trap cleared it); scause/stval/sepc at whatever the trap wrote.

   EVERY GHOST FRACTION IS WHERE prepare_return LEFT IT, and the two mstatus
   bits the mirror tracks return to the same values -- so the excursion
   through userret / user mode / uservec moves no ghost at all and
   [usertrap_res] simply carries the mirror halves across it.  That is why
   this contract mentions no ghost variable of its own.

   AND usertrap'S FIRST ACT CLOSES THE LOOP: the [csrw stvec, kernelvec] at
   +0x1e folds the dangling quarter + the stvec cell + [intr_handler_spec
   kernelvec] into a real [IntrDefs.intr_res], hence [trap_csrs] -- precisely
   the [intr_res] prepare_return's [csrci] will unfold again on the way out.
   The C comment ("send interrupts and exceptions to kerneltrap(), since
   we're now in the kernel") IS that fold, and the order is forced: before
   +0x1e this hart has no kernel handler, so nothing there may enable
   interrupts.

   ==== THE POST CROSSES ================================================

   usertrap PARKS -- yield on the timer arm, and every sleeping syscall
   through [SpecSyscall]'s own [wp_next true pj] -- so it may return on a
   different hart and the post has to be a crossing.  The consequence is on
   the CALLER (see eb-generic-sweep.md on [wp_next]'s polarity): the trap-loop
   composition must build its continuation hart-generically.

   ==== WHAT IS STILL OWED (the trampoline dovetail) =====================

   This statement moves the trampoline seam rather than closing it: composing
   uservec -> usertrap -> userret (the Loeb theorem that discharges
   [UserExec.stvec_handler_wp]) owes three conversions -- the kernel table
   exclusive<->shared, the trapframe page physical<->VA, and
   [user_cfg] <-> [sconf]'s cells (which needs [uc_mie C = MIE_S]; sconf pins
   mie and [ucfg] only constrains [mie & ~mideleg = 0]).  All three are
   trampoline-side work and all three are tracked in
   claude-notes/projects/usertrap.md.  [usertrap_ret_ms] and [satp_rooted]
   stay here: they are the shared vocabulary that seam will be stated in, and
   SpecPrepareReturn's post already spells [satp_rooted]'s three conjuncts out
   longhand rather than importing it (this file has no [Require]ing consumer
   yet -- the two Specs that name it, name it in prose). *)

   tier's (IntrDefs.v), which additionally pins the FS/VS/XS extension
   states, SD and a nominal MPP: it is what [IntrDefs.sconf] carries, so
   usertrap cannot assemble the bundle its callees take without it.  The two
   overlap and neither implies the other.

   [SPIE = 1] is the third: it is what the mirror half inside
   [usertrap_res] agrees with ([IntrDefs.sret_tie]), and it is a fact about
   the code rather than an assumption about the user -- userret's [sret] set

   [ut_round] speaks the trapframe, image, permission map and break; it says

   can retype a descriptor, so the states come back on the nose.  The one
   exception is the ecall, where open/close/dup/pipe are exactly the entries
   that move them.

   WHY THE CALLER NEEDS THIS AND NOT MERELY THE RESIDUE'S INDEX.  The loop
   resumes the process at a key, and the key names the descriptor view
   ([UexecSlot.uvis_fd]).  On a transparent trap it must resume at the view
   that TRAPPED -- [UexecApply.uexec_ret_round_slot]'s transparent arm hands
   back the process's own continuation at the same key, and a key with a
   different fd view is a different contract.  So "the kernel did not move
   them" is a fact the loop has to be TOLD; it cannot read it off the
   fragments it holds ([FdSlots.fd_st_agree] against the authority only ever

   close, dup and pipe each say which slot they changed and to what.

   argument come from the ENTRY trapframe [tf] -- a0 as the kernel FOUND it
   -- and the return value from the OUTGOING one [tf'], whose a0 word is
   what the dispatch's [sd a0,112(s2)] stored over it.  Neither reading is

   epilogue bumps ([UsysMemOk.usys_fd_ok_epc]).

(* A PURE row, and it has to be: what the two kernel rows carry is the
   incarnation's kill one-shot, and [UkRun.urun] binds the process's own
   generation with no resource beside it -- the U tier cannot name it, so
   the reason is absorbed at this boundary
   ([ut_wait_out_forget], [UexecRet.uwait_ans]'s header) and what comes out
   instead is what the shot's REFUTATION proves.
     THE REFUTATION HAPPENS AT +0xa6.  usertrap's second [killed] check is
   the one place a shot can be contradicted: at a zero flag <p->lock>'s row
   holds the UNFIRED one-shot ([SchedCtx.kill_paid_shot_nz]), and
   [ChildTok.kill_pend] is linear, so no refuter can be carried out of that
   critical section.  A process that RESUMES therefore knows the shot was
   never fired, and each of the two rows collapses to its other disjunct:

     * THE READ.  At an open readable CONSOLE descriptor and a non-negative
       count, [SpecFileread.console_receipt]'s -1 arm has exactly two
       exits -- fileread's [n < 0] sign guard and consoleread's [killed]
       test.  The shot is gone and the guard is refuted by the count, so
       the surviving -1 cause AT AN OPEN READABLE CONSOLE FD IS [n < 0],
       NOT A CLOSED FD: the arm is unreachable and the answer is not -1.
     * WAIT.  At a NULL status pointer the failing arm's reason
       ([UserChildren.wait_why]) has three disjuncts and the null pointer
       kills the copyout one, so with the shot gone a -1 means the caller's
       children column was EMPTY.

   Both are read at the ENTRY trapframe and the ENTRY descriptor index --
   the key the deposit went down at -- because that is what the process's
   own returning arm is indexed by. *)
(* WAIT'S HALF IS HERE NOW (lane TRAP-ROWS-3, T4(c)).  It was written as a
   gap: refuting [r = -1] on [UserChildren.wait_ans]'s REAPING arm needs the
   reaped child's pid to be something other than -1, and the block's
   registration carried only [bv_unsigned pid <> 0].  The registration now
   carries the RANGE <allocpid> hands out ([SlotGen.gen_halves_at],
   [1 <= pid <= PIDMAX]), so [UserChildren.sext32_rng_not_neg1] kills the
   reaping arm at a -1 return and [UserChildren.wait_ans_m1] hands back the
   failing arm's reason.  With the null status pointer killing the copyout
   exit and +0xa6's unfired one-shot killing the killed exit, a -1 means the
   caller's children column was EMPTY -- and the reap-nothing arm's set did
   not move, so the caller's own reading is [∅]. *)

(* ...AND THE KILL ROW BESIDE IT (app-echo.md, lane KILL-PAY, K3(b)).
   UNGATED on the cause the way [ut_pay_in] is, and for the same reason:
   the route that carries it does not know which cause it is on.  But it is
   READ only at a [UexecRet.ukill_sc] cause -- anything but the ecall and
   the two delegated S-mode interrupts -- and it is [emp] everywhere else,
   so the three arms that never reach setkilled owe nothing.
     WHAT IT IS: the kill row of the trapping process's own deposit
   ([UexecRet.uexec_dep_F]'s non-ecall branch).  WHO SPENDS IT: the
   dispatcher's unexpected-scause arm, which calls setkilled -- and
   [SpecSetkilled] charges the price of a kill.
     TWO-SIDED, AND THEREFORE LINEAR (lane SELF-KILL, P6b): the LEFT side
   is the application's taint, which every generic process holds out of
   the supply, and the RIGHT is the process's OWN exit payload at -1
   ([ChildTok.kill_owed]) -- what a verified program deposits when it
   faults on purpose.  Indexed by the trapping incarnation's GENERATION,
   because that is what the right side's payment is keyed at.
   [xv6G] is bound rather than [ctokG] itself: the bundle carries the
   class as a FIELD instance and two of them in one scope print
   identically (durable-notes). *)
(* ...AND IT IS THE WHOLE PAIR NOW (lane TRAP-ROWS, T3; the owner's ruling
   of 2026-09-16).  What comes down is not the deposit alone but the
   ADDITIVE conjunction the process offered at the trap -- the -1 deposit
   AND the resume slot -- because the two are proved from one copy of the
   process's resources and the KERNEL is the party that decides which one
   it takes: setkilled takes the left, a served vmfault takes the right and
   hands it back through [ut_kill_out].  At the ecall cause there is no
   pair and nothing is owed. *)

(* ...AND WHAT AN ARM ON THE WAY TO THE RESUME MUST STILL HOLD: the slot it
   owes the process if it resumes -- OR the fact that it cannot resume.
   The second disjunct is what [setkilled] leaves behind: the unexpected-
   scause arm spends the pair's LEFT side on the kill and keeps the
   incarnation's one-shot instead ([SpecSetkilled] returns it), and the
   killed check the arm falls into is then refuted against the row
   ([SchedCtx.kill_paid_shot_nz]).  Without this disjunct that arm would

   [usertrap_res] is a PARAMETER, so its type has to be the one its
   instantiation has, and [UsertrapRes.ut_res] is the union of syscall's /
   devintr's / vmfault's / printk-general's / kexit's environments.  It is
   SpecKexit.v's list verbatim (kexit is the deepest of the five, and the

     ALSO owns the same page's bytes, at the physical tier, as [tf_pa]
     cells (SpecUserret.v's vocabulary), for the whole 44-instruction save/
     restore walk.  Rather than have [usertrap_res] itself borrow-and-return
     the page (which would ripple [wp_usertrap_body]'s type and, through it,
     ONLY every internal usertrap block that already threads [usertrap_res]
     opaquely -- no external file), this accessor lets a HOLDER of
     [usertrap_res] pull [tf_page] out for a moment and hand back a
     (possibly different) one to reseal it -- exactly the shape uservec's
     tail needs: open, convert its own [tf_pa] cells in, close. Concrete

     in, and impossible for anything parked across user execution, where
     [UptTree.utlb_inv_pt] owns [satp] at the USER root instead.  Holding
     both is contradictory, so a consumer that took [usertrap_res] beside a
     user-mode table would be vacuous rather than wrong-looking.  uservec
     therefore takes the PARKED residue, and its exit switch's own

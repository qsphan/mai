(* CalleeSaved.v -- a predicate for callee-saved register preservation across a
   function call, for use in whole-function WP postconditions.

   A well-behaved RISC-V function preserves the callee-saved registers: it may
   clobber the caller-saved ones (ra, t0-t6, a0-a7) freely, but every
   callee-saved register holds, on return, exactly the value it held on entry.
   [callee_saved m m'] captures precisely that relationship between the entry
   register map [m] and the return register map [m']: it says nothing about the
   caller-saved registers (their values are arbitrary and irrelevant), and
   asserts that each preserved register agrees in [m] and [m'].

   The preserved set is exactly the classic RISC-V callee-saved registers:
   sp (x2), s0 (x8), s1 (x9), s2..s11 (x18..x27).  tp (x4) is NOT among them.
   tp holds the CURRENT hart's id, and a call may park: a preempted thread can
   be re-scheduled on another hart and inherits that hart's tp (xv6's [swtch]
   does not save it), so no contract may claim [m' !!! x4 = m !!! x4].  Nothing
   is lost by dropping it -- [HartTp.tp_pin] makes "tp holds this hart's id"
   true BY CONSTRUCTION at whatever hart a continuation is quantified over, so
   contracts need no tp conjunct at all.  Function-call WPs universally
   quantify the return register map over the whole continuation --
   [∀ m', ... -∗ gpr_file m' -∗ ⌜callee_saved m m'⌝ -∗ ... -∗ WP ...] -- in place
   of an ad-hoc, per-function list of individual register-preservation facts.
   (Callers thus receive [m'] and the preservation fact directly, rather than
   destructing an [∃ m', gpr_file m' ∗ ⌜callee_saved m m'⌝] package.) *)

  (* ARM (a) IDENTIFIES THE FILE and arm (b) is REFUTED, and both do it
     from the SAME pair: the walk's terminal cursor says the observed inum
     is the pin's, the receipt says the row the kernel read is the row of
     a view the pin holds of, and the pin says what that row is.  So
     [f' = f] on (a) -- and the caller's constructor answers from
     [kexec_image_ok f] -- while on (b) the observed node is a loadable
     file and [~ anode_loadable a] is absurd.  Either premise at the taint
     is paid by the generic slot.

     [Pay] goes to ARM (a) ONLY: arm (b) never returns and needs nothing

     forkret calls [kexec("/init", {"/init", 0})] with a literal vector
     and there is no caller image to read one out of.  So the identifying

       a verified program's U-tier knowledge of its own table is
       [UserFd.ustd] (the low [NSTD] slots) and its [ufd] handles, and
       neither says anything about the rest of it, so a program CANNOT
       state all-parkedness of the table it execs with.  The premise
       belongs on [SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre]'s two WANDS, where the party
       that supplies it is the KERNEL -- which holds the block and reads
       the fact straight off it ([ProcInv.proc_priv_parked]). *)

   else: the walk's START inum is the run's head (the C3 start rule at
   this path -- absolute paths ignore [cw], relative ones take it), the
   run's LAST inum is [ino], and at every view the claim admits the run is
   a run and [ino] holds the NODE [a].

   THE NODE, NOT A FILE: exec's pin is at [MkAnode (AFile f) nl] and a
   device pin is at [MkAnode (ADev ma mi) nl], so the node is where the
   syscalls differ and the walk is where they agree.

   [pin_misses_at Pin cw pl d0] is "the walk starts at [d0], and at every

   [d0]".  That is all a walk needs to die: namei's first hop misses, the
   syscall returns [-1], and no later hop and no observation ever runs.

   WHY IT IS A SEPARATE DEFINITION and not [pin_resolves_at] at some inum:
   there IS no inum.  [FsConsPin.cons_absent] is the instance -- /init's
   console at era 0, before its own mknod creates the node.

   THE CLAIM LAW THIS ONE NEEDS IS LINEAR.  "the entry is absent" is not a
   consequence of the claim alone: the claim's console conjunct has a
   PRESENT arm too, and what excludes it is an EXCLUSIVE credential the
   caller holds ([AppEcho]'s console flag is the authority side of that;
   see [UInitCons] section 7).  So section 8's law takes a resource [K] and

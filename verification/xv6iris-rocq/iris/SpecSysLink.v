   @ KernelSyms.sys_link, 292 bytes / 101 instructions (CodeSysLink.v).
   A THIRTY-EIGHT slot frame ([c.addi16sp sp,-304] at +0x00), carved:

     slot  1  (sp+296)  ra
     slot  2  (sp+288)  s0, the frame pointer (= the ENTRY sp)
     slot  3  (sp+280)  s1 = ip     -- saved LATE, at +0x30
     slot  4  (sp+272)  s2 = dp     -- saved LATER STILL, at +0x5c
     slots 5..6         [char name[DIRSIZ]] -- [addi a1,s0,-48]
     slots 7..22        [char new[MAXPATH]] -- [addi a1,s0,-176]
     slots 23..38       [char old[MAXPATH]] -- [addi a1,s0,-304]

   THE TWO REGISTER SAVES ARE SHRINK-WRAPPED.  [c.sdsp s1] runs only after
   BOTH argstr calls succeed and [c.sdsp s2] only after the type and
   NLINK_MAX guards pass, and each exit restores exactly what its own path
   saved -- so the two argstr-failure arms neither save nor restore either
   register, which is sound because neither is written on those paths.
   Nothing about the three buffers reaches this contract: they are carved
   out of [stack_own] with [StackBytes.slotsn_bytes_own].

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT =====================================

   sys_link is the first SYSCALL-level consumer of the CREDITED iupdate
   pair ([SpecIupdate.wp_iupdate_link] / [wp_iupdate_unlink]) and of the
   kernel's NLINK_MAX guard arm, so its walk is where the whole link
   contract layer is exercised end to end.  Two facts about that, because
   they are what the walk is:

   * THE LINK FRAGMENT IS MINTED AND SETTLED INSIDE THIS FUNCTION.  The
     [ip->nlink++; iupdate(ip)] at +0x5e..+0x66 mints one
     [FsStateLink.link_tok] at [ip] against the count that pays for it; on
     the success path the [dirlink] at +0x9c lets the caller DEPOSIT it into
     the parent's [IcacheEscrow.dlinks], caller-side --
     design/fs-icache.md 20.18 ruling 1 keeps every link resource OUT of
     [SpecDirlink]; on every route to [bad:] the [ip->nlink--; iupdate(ip)]
     at +0xfa..+0x106 CONSUMES it back.  Nothing else crosses this
     interface in either direction.
   * THE ORPHAN GUARD IS WHAT MAKES THE DEPOSIT LEGAL.  The [lh a5,74(s2)]
     / [c.beqz] at +0x84..+0x88 -- create's re-check, given to sys_link at
     f60ff58 -- refuses to [dirlink] into a parent a concurrent rmdir has
     orphaned, which would strand the fragment above in a directory whose
     [itrunc] discards records without dropping counts.  Its arm is ARM E2,
     a plain [iunlockput(dp); goto bad;], so nothing about it reaches this
     contract except that the [-1] disjunct now has one more way to happen.
   * THE NLINK_MAX GUARD IS WHAT MAKES THE MINT LEGAL.  [wp_iupdate_link]'s premise
     [di_nlink dn0 <> mword_of_int 32767] is exactly the [beq a4,a5] at
     +0x58 falling through; the [lui a4,0x8 / addi a4,a4,-1] pair at
     +0x54/+0x56 is 32767,
     and the test is [==] rather than [>=] because [nlink] is a signed
     short and NLINK_MAX is SHRT_MAX.  The SIGNED/UNSIGNED gap the twelfth
     stop recorded is closed by [InodeRegion]'s (L4) range clause, which is
     where the increment premise is discharged.

   ==== THE REFERENCE LEDGER CLOSES AT THREE ON EVERY ARM ===============

   [iref_slots 3] goes in and comes back out unchanged, and three -- one
   more than sys_chdir's two -- is forced by the SECOND resolve: when
   nameiparent runs, [ip] is already held.

   * namei takes two units and hands ONE back on success (the second pays
     for the reference it returns), so the walk's peak is [ip] plus the
     walker's own two;
   * nameiparent does the same for [dp];
   * every arm releases what it made -- [iunlockput(ip)] on the type and
     NLINK_MAX arms and at [bad:], [iunlockput(dp)] + [iput(ip)] on the
     success arm -- and the two argstr arms make no reference at all.

   ==== THE LOG LEDGER IS THE SET FORM, AND IT HAS TO BE ================

   begin_op mints [LogInv.log_op g MAXOPBLOCKS] = ten units and end_op
   retires whatever is left, so nothing log-shaped crosses this interface.
   sys_link runs TWO unbounded-depth walks inside one transaction, so the
   COUNTED namei/nameiparent contracts are hopeless here for sys_chdir's
   reason squared: [(L + 1) * iput_units] demands twelve of the ten at a
   three-component path, twice over.  The SET form prices each walk at
   [SpecNamex.walk_need L <= 4] and spends at most one.

   Note that the two [argstr] calls run BEFORE [begin_op] -- unlike
   sys_chdir, where the string fetch is inside the transaction -- so the
   two argstr-failure arms carry no log resource at all.

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   [eb = true] is namei's premise, inherited verbatim.  The
   [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded anyway,
   uniformly with begin_op / iupdate / iput / iunlockput / end_op, and is
   [emp] there.

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function sleeps in every one of
   its eleven distinct callees, so it may return on a hart other than the
   one it was called on.

   THE BITMAP IS AN INVARIANT ([BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], inside [fs_ready]):
   [dirlink]'s writei can ALLOCATE and the two walks' iunlockputs can FREE,
   and the contract says nothing about either.

   DETERMINISM: none is claimed, and none is available.  Which of the
   eight arms runs is a function of the FILE SYSTEM and of the user's two
   strings, and no caller of this contract knows any of that.  The
   postcondition is the honest disjunction on the returned a0. *)

(* Owner ruling Q-c (2026-09-05): "strengthen in place -- we have a single
   kernel proof".  There is no parallel AU twin of sys_link; this contract
   IS the one the dispatcher runs, so it grows the commits rather than
   being copied beside one (app-round-e2.md section 4's recommendation, and
   the R10 waiver that goes with it).

   THE DELTA IS THREE INSTANTS, and that is a machine fact -- the same
   stance [SysUnlinkDefs]'s header takes for unlink's two:

     instant 1 -- THE TARGET'S COUNT ([ip->nlink++; iupdate(ip)] at
        +0x5e..+0x66, BEFORE the entry exists).  [FsAbsDelta.delta_link_tgt]
        at the row the machine reads under [ip->lock].  Between it and
        instant 2 the [iunlock(ip)] at +0x6c really releases the record and
        a concurrent observer sees the raised count with no name for it.
     instant 2 -- THE PARENT'S ENTRY ([dirlink(dp, name, ip->inum)] at
        +0x9c).  [delta_link_ent]: the parent gains [nm |-> t]; link is for
        files and devices only, so no count moves.
     instant 3 -- THE UNDO, on every route to [bad:] ([ip->nlink--;
        iupdate(ip)] at +0xfa..+0x106).  [delta_link_untgt] IS
        [delta_unl_tgt], so ITS COMMIT IS [SysUnlinkDefs.utgt_commit_at],
        REUSED VERBATIM rather than cloned.

   [FsAbsDelta.delta_link_split] is the machine-checked composition and
   [delta_link_untgt_tgt] is the fact that instant 3 restores the pre-view
   exactly, in BOTH arms of the target row.

   THE TARGET'S ROW IS A PARAMETER, not a lookup (lane E2-D's one
   deviation): sys_link has NO [ip->nlink == 0] guard -- ProofSysLink.v's
   "THE IIIc WALL" records that the count fact is genuinely unavailable
   there -- so the target may be an unlinked-but-open file with no row at
   all, and the bump RESURRECTS it.  [arow_at] is the side condition, one
   insert either way. *)

(* THE TARGET IS NEVER A DIRECTORY: ARM C's [ip->type == T_DIR] test at
   +0x4c refused it before the bump, which is also why [delta_link_ent]
   moves no count ([FsAbsDelta.acre_bump]'s reading of a non-dir child). *)

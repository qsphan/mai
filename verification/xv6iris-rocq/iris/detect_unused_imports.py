"""detect_unused_imports.py -- find removable Coq `Require Import` modules.

Problem
-------
A `Require Import M` line can be genuinely *needed* even when no NAME from M is
ever written in the file, because M may contribute, invisibly to a text search:

  * typeclass `Instance`s      (resolved by `apply`/`typeclasses eauto`),
  * `Notation`s               (parsing/printing),
  * `Hint`s                   (auto/eauto/autorewrite databases),
  * `Canonical Structure`s / `Coercion`s.

None of those appear as name references in the compiler's `.glob` output, so a
pure glob/grep "is this name used?" check yields FALSE "unused" verdicts.  The
ONLY reliable test is: delete the import, recompile the file, and see whether it
still builds.

Method (glob-shortlist + build-confirm)
---------------------------------------
1. Parse each `.v` for import statements and map every imported module token to
   its full logical path (respecting the `-R <dir> <prefix>` mappings in
   `_CoqProject`), e.g.
       From stdpp Require Import gmap          -> stdpp.gmap
       From iris.proofmode Require Import proofmode -> iris.proofmode.proofmode
       Require Import RiscvModelBytes          -> xv6iris.RiscvModelBytes
       From Kernel Require KernelSyms          -> Kernel.KernelSyms  (no Import)

2. SHORTLIST (fast, `.glob`-only): read the file's `.glob`, collect every `R`
   (reference) line's defining libname, EXCLUDING kind==`lib` refs (those are the
   import/qualifier sites themselves, not "usage that needs an Import").  A module
   whose logical path contributes no non-`lib` reference is a *candidate* unused
   import -- this only NARROWS the set to build-test; it never decides.

   Three rules keep the shortlist honest (each was a large false-positive
   source):

   a. GLOB FRESHNESS.  A missing `.glob` reads as "this file references nothing",
      which flags EVERY import; a `.glob` that does not match its `.v` misses any
      use added since the last build.  Neither is evidence of an unused import, so
      a file whose glob is missing/stale is reported as UNANALYSED (rebuild it, or
      pass `--all`, which build-tests and so needs no glob).  Freshness is decided
      on the `.v`'s md5, which coqc stamps into the glob's `DIGEST` line -- mtime
      would call a glob stale after a byte-identical `cp`/`git checkout`.
      `--allow-stale` opts back into trusting an out-of-date glob.

   b. EXPORT CLOSURE.  glob attributes a reference to the module that DEFINES the
      name, but `Require Export` makes a name reachable through an importer.  If
      `A.v` does `Require Export B` and our file does `Require Import A` and uses
      a name defined in B, glob records only a ref to B -- so A looks unused while
      removing it actually breaks the build (this is exactly what the `WpGpr*`
      shims do here).  Such an import is therefore not reported as REMOVABLE but
      as a REWRITE: nothing defined in A itself is used, so the fix is to import
      B -- the module actually providing the name -- directly, dropping A's
      forwarding indirection.  `--verify` build-tests that rewrite, not a bare
      deletion.  The closure is read from each module's own source, resolved
      through the `-R/-Q` load paths and the opam `user-contrib` tree; a module
      whose source cannot be found has an UNKNOWN closure and is conservatively
      never flagged.

   c. TACTICS ARE NOT IN THE GLOB.  Every reference glob records carries a kind
      -- def, thm, constr, not, inst, ind, ... -- and there is no kind for a
      tactic: neither `Ltac foo` nor a use of `foo` is written to the glob at
      all.  A module reached only for a tactic therefore contributes zero
      references and looks unused, and in a proof tree driven by named tactics
      that is the LARGEST source of shortlist false positives -- each costing a
      whole-file compile to disprove.  So an import is also skipped when the
      file mentions a tactic name the module (or its Export closure) defines;
      see TacticIndex for why that test is textual and why erring toward
      "keep" is the safe direction.

   d. THE SAME MODULE REQUIRED TWICE needs no reference evidence at all, so
      duplicates are a separate, GLOB-FREE finding -- reported (and applied) as
      DUPE candidates even for a file whose glob is missing or stale.  Only an
      occurrence a LATER one subsumes is flagged (`Require Export` outranks
      `Require Import`, which outranks a bare `Require`), and by default only
      when the two sit in the SAME contiguous run of `Require` statements.
      With nothing but other `Require`s between them, dropping the earlier one
      provably changes nothing: module LOADING does not consult the import
      scope, so no statement in between can care, and the surviving occurrence
      re-imports at exactly the same point -- which is what decides shadowing.
      A re-import placed AFTER real code is a different animal; this tree uses
      it deliberately, to re-establish instance resolution at a later point
      (see `UtResFits.v`'s header), so it is only considered under
      `--dupes-across-code`, where the build-confirm is what decides.

      Unlike a removal, a de-dup CANNOT break a DOWNSTREAM file: the module is
      still required by this one, so nothing it transitively loaded goes away.

3. CONFIRM (`--verify`, correct): for each file, apply ALL candidate edits at once
   (a removal drops its module; a rewrite drops it and adds the imports it
   forwards to) and rebuild.  If it still builds, every candidate is genuinely
   applicable.  If it fails, fall back to one candidate at a time.  A candidate
   that still builds is CONFIRMED; one that breaks the build was actually NEEDED
   (an instance/notation/hint false positive).

   A build-test NEVER touches the file under test.  The edited text is written to
   a uniquely-named SIBLING copy (`Foo__dead_import_check_<pid>_<n>.v`) which coqc
   compiles in its place, so the only artifacts written are that copy's own
   `.vo`/`.glob` (deleted right after).  `Foo.v`, `Foo.vo` and `Foo.glob` are left
   byte-identical throughout.  This is what makes step 3 SAFE TO RUN IN PARALLEL
   (`--jobs`): files import each other, so a build-test that overwrote `Foo.vo`
   -- even transiently, even with an identical-in-the-end rebuild -- would be read
   half-written, or in its import-deleted form, by a concurrent test of a file
   that requires `Foo`, silently corrupting that file's verdict.  A copy under a
   fresh module name is imported by nobody, so nothing can observe it.  (The
   `XV6_USE_MAKE=1` fallback builds the real target in place and is therefore
   forced back to `--jobs 1`.)

Caveats
-------
* `Require Export ...` re-exports to DOWNSTREAM files, so a single-file `make` is
  insufficient to prove it removable.  Export lines are SKIPPED by default
  (`--include-export` + `--full-make` would be required to test them safely).
* Shortlist false-negative: if a name defined in M is referenced but is ALSO
  reachable through another (transitive) import, glob still attributes the ref to
  M, so M is not shortlisted and a real removal can be missed.  Pass `--all` to
  build-test every import module (ignoring the glob shortlist) for completeness
  at the cost of many more compiles.

Scope
-----
By DEFAULT the checker only considers imports of THIS package's own modules --
those whose logical path carries the local `-R . <prefix>` prefix (here
`xv6iris.`).  Imports from other packages (SailStdpp, Riscv, stdpp, iris.*,
Kernel, Stdlib, ...) are skipped, since removing a stray external import is
low-value and its provenance is noisier.  Pass `--include-external` to test
those too.

Usage

                                                    # (also covers unbuilt files)
  detect_unused_imports.py --dir . --allow-stale    # shortlist from out-of-date globs

# One `Require` per line (verified: no multi-line Require in this codebase) --
# but a STATEMENT may still span lines, because its trailing comment can; see
# the third paragraph and `ImportStmt.endline`.
#
# THE TRAILING COMMENT IS PART OF THE STATEMENT.  `Require Import X.  (* why *)`
# is this tree's house style for explaining an import, and a pattern that stops
# at the period does not match those lines at ALL -- which does not merely lose
# their comment, it makes the whole import INVISIBLE to every pass here: never
# reported, never removed, never de-duplicated, and (worse, because it is
# silent) counted as CODE by `code_lines`, so a duplicate straddling one looks
# separated by a definition.  That was 1072 of this tree's 25833 `Require`
# lines, across 628 files.
#
# A TRAILING COMMENT THAT RUNS ON IS STILL A TRAILING COMMENT.  `_STMT_RE`'s
# `.*\*\)` cannot cross a newline, so a comment opening on the Require line and
# closing two lines down used to fail to match -- and by the paragraph above,
# that made the import invisible to every pass rather than merely losing its
# comment.  It was not a rare shape: 367 `Require` lines across 181 files, and
# it is why `SpecNameiTr.v` survived every sweep while nothing used it (its
# three importers each annotated the import across three lines).  So a line
# that ends in an UNCLOSED `(*` is now joined with the lines up to the `*)`
# that closes it -- `_OPEN_RE` spots the opening, `comment_spans` finds the
# close (respecting nesting), and `_STMT_ML_RE` matches the joined block.
# `endline` then carries the span, so a deletion takes the whole comment with
# it and can never strand half of one.
#
# Anything after the closing `*)` still fails to match, so a
# `Require ... . (* c *) Definition ...` one-liner is never rewritten.

    WHY BOTH DIRECTIONS EXIST.  Dropping the EARLIER occurrence is the safe
    edit -- the import state after the survivor is identical, so shadowing is
    untouched -- and it is the only one offered for a duplicate inside one
    contiguous run of `Require`s, where it is a provable no-op.  But once REAL
    CODE sits between the two, that direction is also the one most likely to
    FAIL: anything in between that uses a name from the module needs the
    earlier import.  The build then rejects the candidate and both copies
    survive, even when the honest reading is that the LATER one is the
    redundant half.

    So this is the fallback, tried only after the safe direction is rejected.
    It is genuinely weaker: dropping the later occurrence lets any module
    imported between the two keep its shadow over the module's names for the
    rest of the file, where the re-import used to win it back.  A single-file
    compile catches a name that DISAPPEARS, not one that resolves elsewhere and
    still typechecks -- so what stands behind this direction is the whole-tree
    rebuild (a changed meaning almost always breaks a downstream user), and its
    diff is worth reading rather than trusting.

    Refused when the two occurrences differ in strength, which here can only
    mean the kept one is a `Require Export` and this one is not: dropping an

    forwarding import for the module defining the name, a de-dup drops a second
    `Require` of a module the file requires anyway.  Callers report them apart

    would delete the wrong line.

    'remove' and 'dupe' candidates are applied; a 'rewrite' only under

    name that IS used, so deleting it breaks the build (what --verify confirmed
    is the re-point, not a deletion), and re-pointing it is a layering
    judgement -- the re-exporting shims in this tree are deliberate.  A 'dupe',
    by contrast, is no judgement at all: the module stays required by the same
    file, so the edit cannot even reach a downstream one.  Each candidate's
    `kind`/`via`/`occurrence` must be carried through here; rebuilding it as a

    `--verify` compiles each file on its own, but `Require` is transitive for
    LOADING: a file G may use a module B -- typically qualified, `B.lemma` --
    that it never requires itself, because something G requires happens to
    require B.  Removing that link elsewhere compiles fine where it is made and
    breaks G.  (`UkFileDev.v` used `UEchoOut.echo_count_is` and reached
    `UEchoOut` only through `UEchoFile.v`'s dead import of it; every nightly
    sweep removed that import, failed its whole-tree gate, and so landed
    nothing at all.)

    So: B is BORROWED by G when G's glob references B but no `Require` of G's
    own (nor the Export closure of one) loads it.  Once the edits are applied
    to the require graph, a borrowed module G can no longer reach is LOST, and
    every edit that dropped an edge F -> M with F reachable from G and B
    reachable from M is withheld.  Restoring all such edges restores every
    original path from G to B, so one pass suffices, and nothing else is
    touched.  This is conservative (it may withhold an edit another path made
    harmless) and only as good as the globs: a file without a fresh glob
    borrows nothing here, and the whole-tree rebuild remains the gate.

    The real fix is always in G -- require what it uses -- so the report names
    each borrower.  Returns the number of edits withheld.

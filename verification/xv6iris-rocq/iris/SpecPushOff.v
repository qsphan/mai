(* push_off DISABLES interrupts, so it is entered with them in WHATEVER state
   the caller had ([b] generic): a trap can be taken any time before the
   [intr_off] instruction runs, so the continuation is [wp_next b] at the
   ENTRY index, even though the capability it hands back is pinned at
   [false] -- the resource index (what SIE now is) and the [wp_next] index
   (whether a trap could have been taken during the call) are two different
   things here, and this is the function where they diverge.

   PUSH_OFF IS ONE OF THE TWO FUNCTIONS THAT MOVE THE PER-CPU BUNDLE ACROSS
   THE ARM SEAM.  At [b = true] the [cpus[cid]] cells and the counting token
   live inside [sie_arm true p] (IntrDefs.v) and the caller's [cpu_own] is
   just the pure fact plus its own frame [C]; the [csrci] flips the arm to
   [false], and [sie_arm_on_out] hands the payload to the code -- which is
   exactly the [cpu_own (S n) eb p C false] and the [trap_csrs_pay n eb]
   ([= trap_csrs] at the only index reachable from [b = true], n = 0 and
   eb = true) below.  At [b = false] nothing moves and the statement reads
   exactly as it always did.

   AND IT IS THE SEAM AT WHICH THE STACK INDEX MOVES.  [IntrDefs.sie_cap m
   avail b p] owns [trap_res b + avail] free slots below sp -- [avail] usable
   by kernel code plus an ARM-DEPENDENT trap reserve ([kv_frame_slots] at
   [b = true], nothing at [b = false]; see [IntrDefs.trap_res] for why an
   arm-blind reserve is unsatisfiable).  Stack slots are not persistent, so the
   TOTAL carve is CONSERVED across the flip, and the reserve therefore moves
   INTO the usable count when interrupts go off:

     ENTRY  [sie_cap_gpr m av b p]                      carve [trap_res b + av]
     EXIT   [sie_cap_gpr mfin (trap_res b + av) false p]
                                                        carve [trap_res b + av]

   -- the SAME proposition on both sides, a pure re-indexing and never a split.
   The [kv_frame_slots] an enabled caller was holding in reserve become
   ORDINARY USABLE STACK for the interrupts-off window, which is exactly right:
   nothing can trap in that window, so nothing needs a reserve there.  At
   [b = false] the exit index is [trap_res false + av], DEFINITIONALLY [av], so
   every interrupts-off caller reads verbatim as it always did.

   [6 <= av] does NOT move: [av] is still the ENTRY usable count, which is what
   push_off's own 4-slot frame and the mycpu() call come out of. *)

     read [sstatus_read mstatus0]) are reconstructed inside the proof over the
     unbundled mstatus0; the statement stays mstatus0-free.  The noff/intena
     cells and the counting token ride inside [cpu_own]: the noff cell IS the
     level [n], the intena cell records [eb] once n ≥ 1, so no cell arguments
     and no level-mirror premises appear here. *)

(* pop_off is the mirror: [cpu_own]'s own structure (the [S _] arm of
   [intr_count]) already PINS entry at [false] -- level [S n ≥ 1] means SIE
   is off throughout, so there is no [wp_next] at entry, exactly as for
   [mycpu()].  But pop_off's LAST instruction conditionally re-enables
   ([intr_on()], iff the unwound level is 0 and the saved base enable [eb]
   was true), so a trap CAN be taken right there -- the exit index is
   [match n with O => eb | S _ => false end], which is [eb] exactly in the
   interesting (fully-unwound) case and collapses to [false] (no [wp_next]
   needed, by [wp_next_off]) whenever the count does not reach 0.

   POP_OFF IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE ARM SEAM, and the direction that PAYS:
   when the count reaches 0 with an enabled base ([bexit = true]) the final
   [csrsi] re-enables interrupts, and the payload it was holding -- the
   [cpus[cid]] cells plus the counting token at level 0 ([cpu_hart 0 true p])
   together with the [trap_csrs_pay] it was given -- goes back INTO
   [sie_arm true p] via [sie_arm_on_in].  That is why the exit [cpu_own] is
   indexed by [bexit] rather than [false]: at [bexit = true] the caller keeps
   only its frame [C] and the pure fact, and reaches the cells through the
   bundle, at whatever hart it resumes on.

   AND IT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE INDEX SEAM, so [av] HERE IS THE EXIT USABLE
   COUNT and the entry index is [trap_res bexit + av].  Re-enabling interrupts
   must PUT THE TRAP RESERVE BACK, and it comes out of the caller's own usable
   slots -- the very ones push_off freed for it:

     ENTRY  [sie_cap_gpr m (trap_res bexit + av) false p]
                                                    carve [trap_res bexit + av]
     EXIT   [sie_cap_gpr mf av bexit p]             carve [trap_res bexit + av]

   Naming the ENTRY index as the sum (rather than the exit index as a
   difference) is what makes the pair compose SYNTACTICALLY and makes the
   [kv_frame_slots <= _] side condition disappear: a caller that reached here
   through push_off/acquire is holding [trap_res b + N] with [b = bexit] forced
   by [cpu_own] (see [CpuOwn.cpu_own_eb_agree]), so it hands in an index that is
   ALREADY of this form, gets [N] back, and the balanced pair is the identity on
   the index with no arithmetic anywhere.  Spelled the other way round the exit
   index would read [av - kv_frame_slots] and every caller would owe a bound.

   [4 <= av] does NOT move even though [av] changed meaning: pop_off's own
   4-slot frame comes out of the ENTRY count [trap_res bexit + av >= av]. *)

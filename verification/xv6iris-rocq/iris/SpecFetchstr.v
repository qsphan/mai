(* SpecFetchstr.v -- the public interface of fetchstr(), stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

     int fetchstr(uint64 addr, char *buf, int max) {
       struct proc *p = myproc();
       if (copyinstr(p->pagetable, buf, addr, max) < 0)
         return -1;
       return strlen(buf);
     }

   @ KernelSyms.fetchstr = 0x800027c4, 32 instructions / 64 bytes; a 48-byte
   (6-slot) frame with five slots used (ra / s0 / s1 = buf / s2 = max /
   s3 = addr).

   THE POINT OF THE CONTRACT is that copyinstr's and strlen's vocabularies
   MEET here, and nothing has to be translated between them.  copyinstr
   promises [ByteBuf.bb_cstr new k] for some [k < max] (SpecCopyinstr.v);
   strlen assumes exactly that and answers [k] (SpecStrlen.v).  So fetchstr's
   postcondition is a SINGLE existential [k] carrying both the buffer's shape
   and the return value -- which is what makes it usable: a caller learns
   that [buf] now holds a NUL-terminated string AND that the number it got
   back is that string's length.  That is strictly more than copyinstr alone
   says, and it is why xv6 has fetchstr at all.

   AND IT SAYS WHICH STRING.  Beside [fetchstr_ret] the contract hands back
   [fetchstr_got], the relay of [SpecCopyinstr.copyinstr_got] at the block's
   own image [us_M U] and at the address the caller passed in a0: the [k]
   bytes and their terminator ARE the process's bytes at that address.  It is
   a SEPARATE conjunct keyed on the returned length rather than a fold into
   [fetchstr_ret], because [fetchstr_ret] is destructed at a dozen syscall
   proofs that want only the shape, and the keying costs nothing -- [max] is
   below 2^31, so the [-1] answer is no [k] below [max] and the clause is
   vacuous on the failure arm.

   TWO THINGS THE CONTRACT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY.

   - Nothing distinguishing the two failure modes.  [-1] means either an
     unmapped page or [max] bytes with no NUL among them.  No caller
     separates them, and copyinstr's contract does not either.
   - Nothing about [p->sz].  Unlike fetchaddr, fetchstr does NO range test of
     its own: it hands [addr] straight to copyinstr.  copyinstr's defences are
     walkaddr returning 0 and -- now -- vmfault's [va >= psz] test, and the
     [psz] it passes down is [pv_sz V], read out of the block fetchstr already
     holds.  So no SIZE PREMISE enters this contract, even though a size now
     reaches the machine.

   *** [proc_priv]'s DESCRIPTOR NO LONGER COMES BACK UNCHANGED (its IMAGE
   does). ***  It used to: copyinstr
   did not fault pages in, so the descriptor that went into
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_copy] was the descriptor that came out, and fetchstr was
   the one member of the fetch* family whose contract left the process block
   literally alone.  xv6 `4f2fc8b` gave copyinstr's [pa0 == 0] arm a
   [vmfault] call (SpecCopyinstr.v), which lifts it to copyin's altitude and
   takes fetchstr with it:

     - the kalloc tier is threaded through ([!kallocG], [γa],
       [kalloc_env γa None]) -- fetchstr allocates nothing of its own, it is
       vmfault underneath that does;
     - the process comes back with its descriptor EXTENDED, so the
       postcondition quantifies [P'] under [uptd_ext (pv_upt V) P'] and
       returns [proc_priv γf p pid (upd_upt V P')].  This is exactly
       SpecFetchaddr.v's shape, and for exactly its reason;
     - [fetchstr_stack] went 26 -> 56, because copyinstr's own budget went
       20 -> 50 and fetchstr's frame is 6 slots (48 bytes).

   The size copyinstr now demands is [pv_sz V], whose [<= 2^38] bound comes
   from [ProcInv.proc_priv_sz_bound] -- so fetchstr still takes no [szv]
   parameter and still does NO range test of its own.

   [max] IS BOUNDED BY 2^31, not 2^64.  copyinstr would take any [max] below
   2^64, but strlen's answer is a C [int] computed with a [subw]
   (SpecStrlen.v), so the length must fit; a caller's buffer is a fixed-size
   kernel array (argstr's is [MAXPATH]), which discharges this trivially. *)

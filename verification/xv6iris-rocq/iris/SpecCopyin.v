(* SpecCopyin.v -- the public interface of Copyin, stated independently of

   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     int copyin(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 psz, char *dst, uint64 srcva,
                uint64 len) {
       while (len > 0) {
         va0 = PGROUNDDOWN(srcva);
         pa0 = walkaddr(pagetable, va0);
         if (pa0 == 0 && (pa0 = vmfault(pagetable, psz, va0, 1)) == 0) return -1;
         n = PGSIZE - (srcva - va0);  if (n > len) n = len;
         memmove(dst, (void * )(pa0 + (srcva - va0)), n);
         len -= n; dst += n; srcva = va0 + PGSIZE;
       }
       return 0;
     }

   STATED AT THE [proc_pt] ALTITUDE, like vmfault: copyin PRESERVES the
   valid-user-page-table predicate of the table it reads through, and -- as
   it may fault pages in on the way -- hands back a descriptor EXTENDING the
   one it was given ([uptd_ext_sz szv]: same root, same trapframe, a user map
   that only gained entries, and every entry it gained BELOW [szv]).  The
   size bound is not extra work: vmfault backs a page only after ruling out
   [va >= psz], so the fact is already in the loop; stating it is what lets
   a [proc_priv] caller rebuild its block (ProcInv.proc_priv_copy), which a
   bare [uptd_ext] cannot.  Both exits, 0 and -1, deliver that; a run that
   gives up part-way has still copied a prefix and still faulted in whatever
   it faulted in, so there is nothing to roll back and no reason to split
   the resource story across the two arms.

   WHAT THE DESTINATION BUFFER GETS is named by the MEMORY-INDEXED form
   below, [wp_copyin_sconf_mem]: it runs at [proc_ptm P (uint szv) M], the
   contents-indexed refinement of [proc_pt] (ProcPtOwn.v §5c), and its
   success arm promises [copyin_got M srcva len dst_new] -- byte [j] of the
   destination IS what the process's memory view holds at user va
   [srcva + j].  [M] comes back UNCHANGED: copyin only reads, and the
   lazily-backed pages a fault may add are already in the view
   (SpecVmfault.v), so the promise can be stated against the INPUT [M].

   There WAS an existential-[M] corollary beside it, in which [dst_new] is
   simply universally quantified -- the caller learns only that it still
   owns [len] bytes at [dst].  That is what every current caller speaks, and
   for most of them it is the right altitude: the bytes copyin copies come
   from USER memory, which the kernel may make no assumption about, so a
   caller that wants to constrain what it read must validate the bytes
   itself either way.  What the indexed form buys is the ability to say
   WHICH user bytes those were.

   The [-1] arm promises nothing about the destination.  A run that gives up
   part-way has copied a prefix, and which prefix is not observable from the
   return value.

   The kalloc tier and [cpu_own] are threaded through only because vmfault
   needs them; copyin allocates nothing of its own.

   *** THE SIZE IS AN ARGUMENT NOW, AND THE TWO PROC CELLS ARE GONE. ***
   xv6 `4f2fc8b` gave copyin a [psz] parameter (a1, shifting dst/srcva/len
   down to a2/a3/a4) and made the vmfault beneath it honest: it bounds
   against the [psz] handed in rather than `myproc()->sz`, and maps into the
   [pagetable] handed in rather than `myproc()->pagetable` (SpecVmfault.v).
   copyin therefore touches NEITHER proc cell, so [p_sz p ↦₈{dqs} szv] and
   [p_pagetable p ↦₈{dqp} …] are gone, and with them the [dqs]/[dqp]
   parameters.  [szv] is simply the a1 register value.

   That is not bookkeeping: [p_pagetable p ↦ page_base P.(ud_root)] was the
   unstated claim "the table you are reading through IS the running
   process's".  It was true of every caller, and it is why the contract could
   not be used on a table built but not yet installed.  It is no longer
   claimed, because it is no longer true of the code. *)

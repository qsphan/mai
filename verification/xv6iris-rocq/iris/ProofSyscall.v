(* ProofSyscall.v -- the real proof of syscall(), replacing LinkSyscall.v's
   whole-function axiom.

   STATUS (read this before extending, and re-verify against the actual
   `Admitted`/`Qed` sites rather than trusting this note): the whole
   dispatch is `Qed`-sealed -- prologue, `myproc()`, the `p->trapframe->a7`
   read, the fused range check, the 22-entry jump-table read, the `c.jalr`,
   the shared return tail (`sysc_ret_tail`), the epilogue
   (`sysc_epilogue_tail`) AND the whole unknown-syscall printk fallback
   (`sysc_fallback`, +0x40..+0x56).

   TWENTY of the 22 table entries are WIRED to real, `Qed`'d arms calling
   their own whole-function contracts: 1 fork, 2 exit, 3 wait, 4 pipe,
   6 kill, 7 exec, 8 fstat, 9 chdir, 10 dup, 11 getpid, 12 sbrk, 13 pause,
   14 uptime, 15 open, 17 mknod, 18 unlink, 19 link, 20 mkdir, 21 close,
   22 sync.
   Count the `decide` branches in `sysc_arm_dispatch`, not this list.

   ALL 22 ENTRIES ARE WIRED, and `sysc_arm_placeholder` is GONE with them:
   `sysc_arm_dispatch`'s fall-through is now `exfalso; lia` against its own
   `1 <= k <= 22`, which is why the 22 `decide` branches each name their
   disequality instead of dropping it with `_`.  That retired the tree's
   only `Admitted`.

   Read (5) and write (16) were last, and what unblocked them was not the
   dispatch: it was `31f115a` making `0 <= n` a fact of the code (so neither
   contract asks its caller for anything about the count) and
   `ConsoleInv.console_inv` giving the devsw column an owner.

   15 open came in once its iref ledger became an EQUALITY.  Its contract
   used to promise only `ns - sys_open_slots <= ns' <= ns`, and this
   dispatch lends [IREFSPARE] and must get [IREFSPARE] back, so no
   instantiation could close -- the arm was unwireable for arithmetic, not
   for want of a resource.  The interval was an artefact of dropping the
   untyped table entry's own unit when the slot was opened; publishing a
   file releases it in exchange for the inode reference it parks, so
   sys_open spends nothing.  See [SpecSysOpen]'s post.

   ==== THE ENVIRONMENT IS [FsReady.fs_ready] NOW, AND THAT CLOSED THE
        WHOLE "GENUINELY MISSING RESOURCES" CATEGORY ====================

   `syscall_env` used to be `sysc_proc_env` plus twenty-five conjuncts of
   file-system fabric spelled at `fn`'s own field names, PLUS a
   `kalloc_env`/`printk_env` pair at fresh existentials.  It is now

       syscall_env γf pj bn fn  =  sysc_proc_env γf ∗ sysc_fs_env pj bn fn
       sysc_fs_env pj bn fn     =  ⌜sysc_proc_ties pj bn fn⌝ ∗ procs_inv (fcn_procs fn)
                                   ∗ disk_geom (fcn_disk fn) (fcn_pd fn) …
                                   ∗ is_lock (fcn_dlock fn) … (disk_res …)
                                   ∗ FsReady.fs_ready

   -- twenty-three EQUATIONS saying the caller's threaded `bn`/`fn` name the
   ambient file system, the disk fabric at `fn`'s three virtio ring pages,
   and the one predicate that says the file system is ready to operate.
   (The three ring pages were equations too, until `fs-cfg-boot.md` R1 took
   `fsc_desc`/`fsc_avail`/`fsc_used` out of `FsCfg.fscfg`: `virtio_disk_init`
   `kalloc`s them at WP time, so the boot-era fupd that builds the record
   cannot know them.  `fs_ready` quantifies them and the pair of resources
   above is what an equation against a field used to buy -- see
   `sysc_proc_ties`' note.  Interderivable, so nothing below moved.  Two more
   equations left later, for a different reason: `sct_dqb`/`sct_dqs` named
   `fclose_names` fields that the bitmap-invariant sweep deleted, the
   superblock cells now being DISCARDED for good and every contract that
   reads one taking it at a generic `dq` this dispatch fills in with
   `DfracDiscarded`.)  Three consequences, and they are the reason six
   entries could be wired in one increment:

   (1) THE UNREACHABLE-WITNESS PROBLEM IS GONE BY CONSTRUCTION.  There is
       exactly one file system per boot ([FsCfg.fscfg]), so a bundle at the
       ambient names and one at `fn`'s are the same bundle modulo the ties;
       nothing has to be existentially guessed.  `sysc_fs_env_all` applies
       the ties once, for the whole bundle, and hands the old
       twenty-four-conjunct shape back -- which is why the arms that predate
       this change did not move.  The ONE row it does not hand back is the
       icache's: `SpecFileclose` retired `fileclose_ic_env` (fileclose takes
       `⌜fclose_ties fn⌝` and `fs_ready` instead), and rather than keep a
       copy of a deleted definition, the fifteen conjuncts are DERIVED from
       the bundle's own `fs_ready` by `sysc_ic_env_of_ready` -- one lemma
       application per arm, in the old body's order, so the arms' inner
       destruct patterns are still verbatim.
   (2) FOUR ROWS THAT COULD NOT BE STATED AT ALL BEFORE now come for free:
       `sb_ninodes` and `sb_size` (there is no `fclose_names` field for the
       inode count, so the old closer bundle never carried them),
       `bitmap_geom_ok`,
       the `16*nib <= 2^16` mkfs tie, and the printk credential PAIR.  They
       are the create-family entries' own premises, and they come off
       [FsReady.fs_geom_ok] / [FsReady.fs_sb_cells].
   (3) IT HAS A PRODUCER.  `syscall_env` was, in its own words, a Definition
       nobody constructs; `fs_ready` has [FsReady.fs_ready_establish].  The
       boot wiring still owes the call, but the obligation is now a named
       lemma rather than an open question.

   ==== WHAT BLOCKS THE REMAINING TWO, measured against their own
        `SpecSysXxx.v` -- ONE debt, and it is not an environment problem ==

   (Debts (A) and (B) below are both RETIRED.  They are kept for their
   shapes: (B) is the one that stops a proof dead without any build
   noticing, and (A) is the one where the FUNCTION was already right and
   only its CONTRACT was weak -- three times over, for three entries.)

   (A) RETIRED -- THE REFERENCE LEDGER DID NOT CLOSE, for mkdir, mknod and
       then open.
       An entry returning `iref_slots ns'` at less than `IREFSPARE` cannot
       be wired: `wp_syscall_sconf_body` hands out `iref_slots IREFSPARE`
       and must get `IREFSPARE` back, because [UsertrapRes.ut_own] carries
       the allowance at that literal and [SpecUserretClosed]'s trap loop
       gets its residue back UNCHANGED on the next trap.  A leak of one unit
       per `open` breaks the Löb invariant, so no honest weakening helps:
       the ledger has to close.
       - `sys_mkdir` (20) and `sys_mknod` (17) ARE WIRED.  This entry used
         to say the fact was TRUE for them and only the statement weak --
         create returned the INTERVAL `ns - create_slots <= ns' <= ns` --
         and that tightening it was create's job rather than the syscall's.
         That is what was done: all nine of create's continuation sites
         already computed the exact figure and then weakened into the
         interval, so [SpecCreate]'s post states it outright now
         (`if ok then S ns' = ns else ns' = ns`), mkdir's and mknod's own
         posts say `ns' = ns`, and the arms pass the whole allowance in and
         take the whole allowance out.  It also made both wrappers in
         [FsSyscalls.v] composable, which its note (S3) had ruled out.
       - `sys_open` (15) IS WIRED, and it was the same story a third time.
         This entry used to say the unit was genuinely spent for good --
         the success arm PARKS the reference in `f->ip`
         ([FileInvDefs.inode_pay]), where it lives as long as the
         descriptor does -- and that what was missing was a HOLDER for the
         NFILE units [IREFSLOTS] provisions for ftable entries.  The
         diagnosis was right and the holder is exactly where it guessed:
         [FileInvDefs.file_core] parks `iref_frac q` on the untyped and
         pipe arms, so a free entry's payload IS one unit.  It needed no
         per-`ofile` ghost state in the end, because nothing has to ask
         what type the file is: a whole reference CARRIES the payload, so
         [ProofSysOpenParts.so_open_slot] -- which was dropping it --
         simply hands it back, and the entry holds one unit's worth either
         way, as `iref_frac` when free and as the inode reference once the
         file is published.  [SpecSysOpen]'s post says `ns' = ns`.
   (B) RETIRED -- A CONTRACT WHOSE PID FRACTION EXCEEDED WHAT EXISTS.
       `sys_pipe` (4) used to take `proc_priv` AND
       `SpecFileclose.fileclose_fs_env`, and the latter carried a QUARTER of
       `p->pid`; [ProcInv.proc_priv] owns one half and [SchedCtx]'s state
       resource the other, so three quarters was more than any thread can
       hold outside the proc lock.  Nothing in the build saw it (the premise
       set is satisfiable in isolation -- durable-notes.md's "satisfiable in
       isolation, refutable at the call site"), and the only caller was an
       `Axiom`.  `sys_close` (21) had the same defect.

       BOTH ARE FIXED, and the fix went further than either contract: NO
       file-system contract asks for a fraction of `p->pid` any more.  The
       block ([ProcDefs.proc_priv_bare]) is what travels, from `bread` and
       `bmap` up through `namex` and `fileclose`, and only `acquiresleep`
       and `holdingsleep` -- the two functions that actually load the field
       -- ever see it, borrowing it for that one instruction.  `sys_pipe` is
       WIRED as `sysc_arm_pipe`; its two surviving tie premises (`fcn_pid`,
       `fcn_dq`) are discharged there the way sys_close's are.
   (C) A PREMISE ABOUT UNCHECKED USER INPUT, which no dispatcher can ever
       supply.  `sys_read` (5) takes `0 <= sys_rw_count v2` and
       `MAXFILE*BSIZE + sys_rw_count v2 < 2^31`, and `sys_write` (16) the
       first of the two, about the count word the USER wrote.  Retiring
       them is not spec plumbing:
       - the MAXFILE half is a WEAKENING [SpecFileread.v]'s own header says
         can be relaxed to `n < 2^31` ("mechanical: three uses in ProofFileread.v"), and `sys_rw_count_lt` gives `< 2^31` free -- so
         this half costs one afternoon in fileread;
       - `0 <= n` is readi's overflow arm.  xv6's `off + n < off` test at
         readi+0x026 is DEAD BY PREMISE today ([SpecReadi.v]'s COVERAGE
         NOTE); a negative count arrives as a huge `uint` and fires it.
         What that needs is the wrapping reading of the `c.addw` at +0x022,
         one extra case in `rd_clamp` (0 when `2^32 <= off + n`, which is
         exactly when the test fires) and the arm behind it -- after which
         every readi caller owes a "the sum does not wrap" side condition,
         dischargeable from its own bound.  piperead and consoleread are
         total in a non-positive count already (their loops simply do not
         run), and filewrite's chunking answers -1.

   THE RANK PREMISE IS NOT AN OBSTACLE, AND NO CONTRACT NEEDS TO CHANGE FOR
   IT.  dup/fork/kill/pause/uptime/sync each demand
   `locks_below lks "<rank>"` while `wp_syscall_sconf_body` says nothing
   about `lks` -- but it does not have to.  `syscall()` runs at push_off
   level 0, so `sysc_arm_pre` carries `cpu_own 0 ...`, and
   `CpuOwn.cpu_own_zero_empty` DERIVES `lks = ∅` from it; then
   `LockRank.locks_below_empty` discharges the premise at ANY rank.  Two
   lines per arm (see the comment above `sysc_noff0`), zero ripple into
   usertrap's cone.  SpecSysLink.v's header documents the same derivation
   at its own altitude.

   `sys_exit` (k = 2) IS WIRED (`sysc_arm_exec`'s neighbour
   `sysc_arm_exit`), and every obstacle this header used to attribute to it
   turned out to be a misreading.  Kept because each one is a shape another
   GAP entry may present:

     - THE DIVERGENCE WAS FREE.  Its contract ends in a bare `WP Loop` with
       no continuation, which reads like it cannot fit `sysc_arm_goal` -- but
       `iProp` is AFFINE, so the arm simply DROPS the continuation it is
       handed.  No bespoke branch, no shape change.
     - THE SIX `fn` TIES DISSOLVED TO ONE, because `pj` is an index of
       `syscall_env` too.  An arm may instantiate its callee's proc-array
       parameters AT `fn`'s fields rather than at the dispatch's, so
       `procs_inv (fcn_procs fn)`, the lookup and `pj = proc_addr (fcn_j fn)`
       all moved inside `sysc_fs_env`, where they mention only `fn` and `pj`.
       `fcn_bio fn = bn` and `fcn_dq fn = DfracOwn (1/4)` went the same way.
       Only `fcn_pid fn = pid` was left, and it is a pure premise of
       `wp_syscall_sconf_body` that usertrap discharges by `reflexivity`
       (`UsertrapRes.un_fn` is DEFINED out of the fields it names).  The
       record premise itself is then just record eta: `sysc_fn_eta`.
     - THE NINE MISSING RESOURCE FAMILIES were a NAMING problem, the same one
       `sysc_fs_env` was built for.  It now carries the allocator at `fn`'s
       own `fcn_kmem`/`fcn_kalloc` and the icache bundle whole.
     - `kstack_closer` WAS THE ONE REAL OBSTACLE, and the additive exit slot
       is what removed it -- see `sysc_exit_ty` here and the note at the slot
       in SpecSyscall.v.  This arm is its only consumer: it takes the right
       conjunct and walks the anchor down syscall's own four frame cells
       (which is what `sysc_arm_goal`'s four `word_pointsto`s ARE, once
       `StackOwn.stack_own_4_intro` folds them), landing exactly on the
       anchor and depth `SpecSysExit` names.  Those cells are spent, and
       rightly: nothing pops this frame.

   THE LESSON: this catalogue was wrong about sys_exit on three counts out
   of four, and it was wrong in the SAFE direction each time -- it
   over-counted the obstacles.  Re-measure an entry against its own
   `SpecSysXxx.v` before believing what is written here.

   THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF THE REMAINING WORK, worked out by reading the
   precedents below (do this before touching the proof, it will save many
   remote-build round trips):

   - `syscall()`'s own machine code (KernelSyms.syscall, 100 bytes / 33
     instructions, decoded in CodeSyscall.v) is: a 32-byte frame (ra/s0/s1/
     s2), a direct call to `myproc()` (mirrors ProofSysGetpid.v's own
     myproc-call handling almost verbatim), a load of `p->trapframe->a7`
     (offset 168 off `p->trapframe`, itself loaded at offset 88 off `p`)
     into a5, the ALREADY-PROVED fused range check, `slli`+`auipc`+`addi`+
     `add` computing `&syscalls[num]`, a `c.ld` of the table entry into a5,
     a redundant `beqz a5,fallback` (dead when `1<=num<=22`, refuted by
     `sysc_target_nz`), then `c.jalr a5` -- THE INDIRECT CALL.  On return:
     `sd a0,112(s2)` (store the result to `p->trapframe->a0`), `c.j` over
     the fallback block, then a shared epilogue (reload ra/s0/s1/s2, pop the
     frame, `c.ret`).  The fallback block (unknown syscall number) calls
     `printk("%d %s: unknown sys call %d\n", p->pid, p->name, num)` then
     stores `-1` to `p->trapframe->a0`, falling through to the same shared
     epilogue.
   - `c.jalr a5` IS PRECEDENTED: `WpSconfCtl.wp_cjalr_s_sconf` (its own
     header names this exact use: "fileread's FD_DEVICE arm calls
     devsw[major].read") is the general "indirect call through a register"
     leaf, target `ret_pc (rget m rs1)`.  `ProofFileread.v`'s `devsw[major]
     .read` dispatch (~line 1150-1400) is the closest worked example of
     resolving a table-loaded register to a KNOWN symbol and then applying
     that symbol's whole-function `Module Type` contract exactly like any
     other WP leaf -- no extra combinator beyond the usual `wp_next`/
     `cpu_own_transport`/`wp_next_chain` glue.
   - `ProofArgraw.v` (argraw() itself IS a computed-index jump table, its
     own header says "the first proof in the tree over a computed indirect
     jump") is the load-bearing STRUCTURAL template for the whole dispatch:
     a symbolic-index prologue reaching a table-word fact (`ar_table_word`,
     mirrored here by the already-Qed'd `sysc_table_word`), ONE per-index
     "arm" lemma per case (`ar_arm0`..`ar_arm5`), a tiny combinator
     (`ar_arm`, a bare `destruct k as [|[|...]]; [apply ar_arm0|...]`) and
     the capstone (`wp_argraw_sconf`) assembling prologue + `ar_arm` +
     epilogue.  THIS FILE SHOULD FOLLOW THAT SHAPE AT 22 ARMS INSTEAD OF 6:
     one top-level lemma per `sysc_target` case (heterogeneous types, since
     each `SysXxx` module wants a different resource subset -- unlike
     argraw's six arms, which all shared one trapframe-argument shape), a
     shared prologue lemma reaching the `c.jalr` with `a5` known per-case,
     and a shared epilogue lemma (the `sd a0,112(s2)` / `c.j` / reload /
     pop / `ret` tail) that every RETURNING arm hands its result to.
     `sys_exit`'s own `SYSEXIT.wp_sys_exit_sconf` DIVERGES (bare `WP Loop`,
     no continuation -- see `SpecSysExit.v`), so its arm does not reach the
     shared epilogue at all; see `ProofSysExit.v`'s own call into
     `Kexit.wp_kexit_sconf` for the shape of applying a diverging callee.
   - `syscall_env` is FULLY PERSISTENT (every conjunct is), so it needs no
     open/reassemble dance across a call the way `UsertrapRes.ut_own`'s
     mutable pieces do (`ut_own_rebuild` is the pattern for THOSE, not
     for this) -- derive a `#`-copy once and every arm (and the printk
     fallback) can peel out whichever pieces it needs while the original
     hypothesis stays available, unchanged, to hand back verbatim as `R γf
     pj bn fn` in the continuation.
   - THE OLD RESOURCE-ONLY "EASY (14) / GAP (8)" CATALOGUE IS DELETED, and
     it was wrong in both directions: it counted only what `syscall_env`
     had to SUPPLY, so it called `read`/`write` easy (they carry
     unpayable PURE premises) and `chdir`/`link`/`unlink`/`close`/`sync`
     hard (their resources are all in `fs_ready`).  The debts in the
     STATUS block above are the measured replacement.
   - Syscall ARGUMENTS never cross this file's own concern: every `sys_xxx`
     is niladic in C and reads its own arguments out of `proc_priv`'s
     trapframe page via its own internal `argint`/`argraw`/... calls
     (`ProcGeom.tf_arg_idx`), so `syscall()`'s dispatch does no argument
     marshaling at the `c.jalr` site -- the live register file handed to
     the callee is unconstrained on entry, exactly as `wp_cjalr_s_sconf`'s
     own statement allows.
   - Budget (`av`): `K_syscall = 4 + K_sys_exec` is syscall's OWN 4-slot
     frame plus the deepest callee's own bound, and sys_exec (244) really
     is the deepest -- the runners-up are link 154, open 148, mknod and
     unlink 144, mkdir 142, chdir 136.  myproc()'s call (BEFORE the
     dispatch) needs `(av-4) >= 10` (mirrors ProofSysGetpid.v /
     ProofArgraw.v verbatim), which 244 trivially covers.  After myproc
     returns, `av` is back at the caller's own remaining `(av-4)` for the
     rest of the function, including the dispatch call, so every arm's own
     `K_sys_xxx <= av - 4` premise falls out of `K_syscall <= av` by `lia`.

   ALL 22 sys_* FUNCTIONS ARE PROVEN AND LINKED (sysfile.c is 16/16 and
   file.c 7/7), sys_unlink included -- LinkSysUnlink.v retired the last
   stub axiom.  So nothing below this file is missing: both remaining
   unwired entries are blocked on debt (C) in the STATUS block, and on
   nothing else. *)

(* WHAT IS LEFT OF THE TIES: THE PROCESS [fn] IS ABOUT.

   [SpecSyscall.v]'s header calls the problem these solve the
   UNREACHABLE-WITNESS problem: a bundle that held the fs fabric at FRESH
   EXISTENTIALS could never be shown to describe the same file system as
   the block/inode resources a closer's contract states at [fn]'s own
   fields.  The first answer was to spell the whole fabric at [fn]'s fields
   -- twenty-five conjuncts of it, restated inside [sysc_fs_env].

   THE SECOND ANSWER, WHICH IS THIS ONE, IS THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE FILE
   SYSTEM.  [FsReady.fs_ready] is that fact as a predicate: every fs
   invariant, lock handle, certificate, superblock cell and geometry
   premise, at the AMBIENT [FsCfg.fscfg]/[IcacheRefDefs.icfg] names, with a
   PRODUCER ([FsReady.fs_ready_establish]) -- which no version of
   [syscall_env] ever had.  So the environment is [fs_ready] plus the
   equations saying the caller's threaded [bn]/[fn] name that same file
   system, and every conjunct the old bundle restated is now a projection
   away.

   Written as a RECORD rather than a conjunction chain because it is
   twenty-eight equations and an arm wants three of them by name.  Compare
   [FsSyscalls.fs_geom], which is the same device for the pure geometry one
   layer out.

   THE THREE THAT ARE NOT EQUATIONS ([sct_pj], [sct_j], [sct_plock]) are
   PROCESS facts about the process [fn] is about, and they are here for the
   same reason they were in the old bundle: an arm may instantiate its
   callee's proc-array parameters at [fn]'s fields rather than at the
   dispatch's, and then it needs them.  [fs_ready] carries no process
   content at all (FsCfg.v's header), which is why they live here and not
   there. *)

  (* syscall_env -- the union of everything the wired entries need
     that is NOT one of the four explicit families (bslots/initproc/
     fd_slots/iref_slots).  Every conjunct is Persistent (is_lock,
     kalloc_env at [None], procs_avail at [None], printk_env), so the whole
     bundle is held with [#] and never needs reassembly across a call --
     no wired entry writes anything inside it.  THERE IS NO MUTABLE FIFTH
     FAMILY any more: the block bitmap used to ride outside as
     [fileclose_bm fn us], re-indexed on the way out, and it is now the
     persistent [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv] inside [FsReady.fs_ready] -- which is
     why [sysc_arm_pre] and [sysc_hcont_ty] lost a row and a binder each. *)

     [sysc_fs_env] in it, it now genuinely uses [bioG]/[logG]/[fsCrashG]
     too).  And it is what lets the body MENTION [sysc_fs_env] at all: a
     Section-variable [Σ] would not be this definition's own. *)
  (* ===================================================================== *)
  (* THE FILE-SYSTEM FABRIC, AT [fn]'s OWN NAMES -- what closing a GAP entry
     costs, and it is a NAMING change, not a type change.

     The nine wired entries all take their icache/fs ghost names as
     free-standing parameters, so a fresh existential inside this bundle was
     exactly as good as one tied to the ambient [fn].  The GAP entries are
     precisely the ones where that stops being true: [sys_exec] consumes
     [KexecDefs.fs_fabric] AND the two superblock cells AND
     [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], all in the same breath and all at
     [fn]'s own [fcn_fs]/[fcn_bmapstart]/[fcn_cov]/[fcn_logstart]/[fcn_size],
     so a fabric over fresh existentials could never be shown to describe the
     same file system -- SpecSyscall.v's header calls that the
     UNREACHABLE-WITNESS problem, and it is why the two extra indices [bn]/
     [fn] exist.  So everything the fabric needs that [sysc_bm_cells] also
     pins is spelled at [fn]'s fields, and the rest is spelled at the AMBIENT
     [icfg] class ("there is one inode cache"), which is what lets
     [dev]/[nib]/[g] be discharged by [eq_refl] instead of by a tie.

     EVERYTHING IS AT [fn]'s OWN FIELD NAMES, and the ties to the ambient
     [icfg] class ride as pure conjuncts rather than being baked in.  That
     is what lets one bundle serve two very differently-shaped callees:
     [sys_exec] takes [dev]/[nib]/[g] as parameters and asks for them to
     equal [icfg_dev]/[icfg_nib]/[icfg_log], while [sys_exit] asks for
     [⌜fclose_ties fn⌝], which is at [fn]'s fields throughout.  Spelling the
     bundle at [fn] and carrying the ties makes both a rewrite away;
     spelling it at [icfg] would have made the second unreachable.

     THE ICACHE IS NOT A ROW OF THIS BUNDLE, nor of [sysc_fs_env_all].
     [is_itable2]/[itable_inv]/[ic_escrows]/[ic_sleeplocks] used to be
     conjuncts of [syscall_env] in their own right, at fresh existentials;
     they are conjuncts of [FsReady.fs_ready] now, so an arm that wants them
     derives them with [sysc_ic_env_of_ready] (below) out of the very
     [fs_ready] this bundle already carries.

     [procs_inv (fcn_procs fn)] IS here, unlike in the first version of this
     bundle.  [sysc_arm_pre] already carries [procs_inv γs] at the DISPATCH's
     own [γs] and the two cannot be tied -- but they do not have to be: an
     arm is free to instantiate its callee's proc-array parameters at [fn]'s
     fields instead of at the dispatch's, and then it wants [fn]'s own
     [procs_inv].  Both are persistent, so carrying the two costs nothing.
     That is what dissolves four of the six ties SpecSyscall.v's header
     attributed to [sys_exit]; only [fcn_pid fn = pid] escapes, and it is a
     pure premise of [wp_syscall_sconf_body] (usertrap discharges it by
     [reflexivity] -- [UsertrapRes.un_fn] is built from the very fields the
     tie names). *)
  (* the SAME explicit (redundant-with-Section) binder list [syscall_env]
     carries, and for a sharper reason than its own: a definition that took
     the Section's variables would be fixed at the Section's [Σ], and
     [syscall_env] -- which binds its own -- could not then mention it. *)

     Every conjunct below used to be a conjunct of [sysc_fs_env] in its own
     right, spelled at [fn]'s fields.  Keeping the ORDER means the arms'
     existing [iDestruct] patterns read the same, and the diff of this
     increment is one token per arm rather than a rewritten arm -- which
     matters, because a mis-shifted pattern in one of eleven arms is a
     silent change of which resource an arm thinks it holds.

     The last four rows are NEW, and they are what the twelve unwired
     entries were waiting on: [sb_ninodes] / [sb_size] (create's own reads,
     which the old closer bundle never carried ([fclose_names] has no field
     for the inode count), the printk contract ialloc's out-of-inodes arm
     needs, and printk's own credential.  All four come out of [fs_ready]
     free; none of them could have been stated at [fn]'s fields at all. *)

        HERE: fork is the one syscall that BUILDS a second process block,
        and a block carries [FirstTok.first_tok] -- which the parent cannot
        share, its boot arm being exclusive.  The persistent steady arm is
        what a running process can hand to every child forever, and
        [FirstTok.first_tok_of_done] mints the child's from it.
        LAST: every arm's [iDestruct] pattern is positional, so a conjunct
        added anywhere else silently re-binds someone's hypothesis; the
        patterns that end in [& _] absorb this one for free.
        NOBODY CONSTRUCTS THIS BUNDLE YET (it arrives abstractly as
        usertrap's [Rsys]), which is deliberate: the obligation lands
        exactly where forkret will discharge it -- its boot arm persists the
        store and seals the file system, its steady arm already holds

  (* The paragraph above says nobody constructs this bundle yet.  THIS IS
     THE CONSTRUCTOR, and the reason it can exist is the reason the comment
     said the obligation would land at forkret: [FirstTok.first_done] is
     [first_addr |->4[] 0] beside [FsReady.fs_ready], forkret holds it on
     BOTH arms of its [if (first)], and it carries three of this bundle's
     four conjuncts outright.

     WHAT IS ACTUALLY OWED, then, is only what [fs_ready] does not carry:
     [SyscParkEnv.sysc_park_extra]'s four (the nextpid lock, the slot
     ledger, the ticks lock, the console) plus four the caller is holding
     anyway for [UsertrapRes.ut_caps] (the [wait_lock], [is_ftable],
     [procs_inv], [disk_geom]).  All eight are persistent and all eight
     exist before either parker runs.

     THE DISK LOCK IS THE ONE ROW THAT IS NOT A COPY, for the reason
     [sysc_fs_env]'s own header gives: [fs_ready] QUANTIFIES the three ring
     pages (R1) while this bundle names them at [fn]'s fields, so the
     witness is opened here and [FsReady.disk_geom_agree] identifies it with
     the caller's [disk_geom].  That is exactly what that lemma exists for.

  (* THE NINTH ARM: k = 18, [sys_unlink].  Its
     contract (SpecSysUnlink.v) was written to BE [wp_syscall_sconf_body]
     with the entry point changed, abstract environment [R] and all, so the
     arm is the shortest of the nine: hand it [syscall_env] for [R] and every
     other resource verbatim, and its post is [sysc_ret_tail]'s premise list
     already.  Nothing here is weaker than the axiom; wiring it is what makes
     [Print Assumptions] name sys_unlink rather than the dispatch's own
     placeholder. *)
  (* sys_unlink's ARM IS WITHDRAWN, not written.  Origin's arm applied
     [SysUnlink.wp_sys_unlink] at a leading [syscall_env] bundle;
     our line's b284fecb replaced the syscall-shaped placeholder with a
     REAL contract taking [(γf) (γa) (γpr) (gs) (j) (gl) (gu) (gd) (gk)
     (pd pav pu) ...].  Both are real, the shapes disagree, and index 18
     was settled by giving index 18 its own arm at the real shape --
     see claude-notes/projects/fs-sysfile.md, "S7-unlink". *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
  (* THE TENTH ARM: k = 7, [sys_exec] -- the first of the eight entries the
     file header calls the GENUINE SPEC GAP, and the one that shows what
     closing that gap actually costs.  Its contract (SysExecDefs.v) is
     kexec's precondition marshalled: the whole FS fabric, the two
     superblock cells, [bitmap_inv], the kalloc environment and two units of
     the inode-reference allowance.

     THREE THINGS MAKE IT UNLIKE THE NINE ARMS ABOVE, and each was a design
     question rather than a proof detail:

     (1) THE FABRIC IS NOT A NEW INDEX.  sys_exec wants [fs_fabric] over the
         SAME file system its bitmap and superblock rows describe, and those
         are stated at [fn]'s fields -- so the fabric had to move from
         [syscall_env]'s fresh existentials to [fn]'s own names
         ([sysc_fs_env]).  Its two remaining pieces, [procs_inv γs] and
         [kernel_data], are drawn from [sysc_arm_pre] instead, which is what
         keeps [fcn_procs fn] out of the story: the dispatch's own [γs]/[j]/
         [γl] go straight into the call, so none of the three ties
         SpecSyscall.v's header shows sys_exit needing is needed here.
     (2) THE BITMAP NO LONGER CROSSES AT ALL.  It used to be the one mutable
         thing that did -- it came back SMALLER ([used' ⊆ used], kexec's cone
         being the only mover), and [sysc_hcont_ty] carried an [∃ us'] purely
         to re-index it.  [BitmapInv] made it a persistent invariant, so the
         arm takes a copy off [sysc_bm_cells], keeps it across the call, and
         the continuation's binder is gone.
     (3) THE TRAPFRAME PAGE SURVIVES TWO MOVES, NOT ONE.  The copy-ins grow
         the page table before kexec runs ([uptd_ext (pv_upt V) P']) and
         kexec then replaces the address space outright ([kexec_ok] against
         [upd_upt V P']); [ud_tfp] is pinned by BOTH -- by [uptd_ext]'s
         second conjunct and by [kexec_ok]'s success arm -- and composing the
         two is what [sysc_ret_tail]'s immobility premise needs.

     The budget is exact rather than slack: [K_syscall = 4 + K_sys_exec], so
     an arm running at [av - 4] has precisely sys_exec's own bound. *)

  (* THE ELEVENTH ARM: k = 2, [sys_exit] -- THE ENTRY THAT NEVER RETURNS.

     Everything unusual about it is in the contract, not the walk; the walk
     is the shortest of the eleven, because there is no return tail.

     (1) IT DROPS THE CALLER'S CONTINUATION AND TAKES THE CLOSER INSTEAD.
         [sysc_arm_goal] hands the exit slot as [sysc_exit_ty], the additive
         conjunction SpecSyscall.v's note argues for; this arm is the only
         consumer of the right conjunct.  [kstack_closer_frame] walks the
         anchor down syscall's own four frame cells -- which is what the
         four [word_pointsto]s [sysc_arm_goal] carries ARE, once
         [stack_own_4_intro] folds them -- landing on exactly the anchor and
         depth [SpecSysExit] names one frame further down.  Those cells are
         spent, and rightly: nothing pops this frame.
     (2) IT NAMES THE PROCESS THROUGH [fn], NOT THROUGH THE DISPATCH.
         [sys_exit] wants [fn] to BE the record built from the running
         process's names.  Rather than tie [fn]'s fields to the dispatch's
         own [γs]/[j]/[γl], the arm instantiates the callee AT [fn]'s fields
         and draws [procs_inv (fcn_procs fn)] and the two lookup facts from
         [sysc_fs_env] -- which is why four of the six ties the file header
         once attributed to this entry never appear.  [sysc_fn_eta] is the
         premise itself, and the only ties left are the two [sysc_fs_env]
         states ([fcn_bio], [fcn_dq]) plus the one premise
         [wp_syscall_sconf_body] carries ([fcn_pid fn = pid]).
     (3) IT DIVERGES, AND THAT COSTS NOTHING.  [iProp] is affine, so the
         bare [mWP Loop] the contract concludes in discharges
         [sysc_arm_goal]'s own conclusion with the continuation simply
         dropped.  The "bespoke branch" the header used to promise is one
         [iApply]. *)

  (* THE THIRTEENTH ARM: k = 8, [sys_fstat].  The entry the file header
     called obstacle (2) -- "a CONSUMED-AND-NOT-RETURNED environment" -- and
     the obstacle is gone for a reason worth recording: [filestat_fs_env] is
     PERSISTENT except for two rows (the [sb_inodestart] fraction and one
     [bslot]), and those two are EXACTLY [filestat_fs_out].  So the arm does
     not have to hand the environment back at all: it rebuilds it from

     returns.  [sysc_filestat_env] is that carve-and-regather, and the
     "shape decision" the header warned about ([syscall_env] would stop

  (* ENTRY 4, `pipe`.  Shaped exactly like `sysc_arm_close` -- both close
     descriptors they took back out of the fd table, so both carry BOTH of
     fileclose's bundles and let the type select -- with three differences,
     all of them visible in the [with] list:

       - it needs [kalloc_env], because pipealloc allocates the pipe page and
         copyout's vmfault allocates again.  It comes off the environment
         like everything else ([syscall_env_all]'s first conjunct).
       - it takes TWO of the four spare fd units.  sys_pipe can hold two
         references in locals before either reaches a descriptor; both come
         back in its post, which is why [sysc_ret_tail] gets [FDSPARE] again.
       - its post moves the page table.  copyout writes the two descriptor
         numbers into user memory and may fault a page in on the way, so the
         block returns at [upd_upt V P'] rather than at [V] -- and the
         trapframe page, which is what the epilogue's [Rs2] names, is pinned
         by [uptd_ext]'s own second conjunct.

     THE PID FRACTION USED TO BLOCK THIS ENTRY and no longer does: this
     contract takes the NOPID bundle beside [proc_priv] and lends the block
     out of it at each fileclose call.  Its two remaining tie premises are
     discharged the way sys_close's are -- [fcn_pid] from the dispatch's own
     [Hpidt], [fcn_dq] off the [sysc_proc_ties] record. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
  (* ENTRIES 20 and 17, `mkdir` and `mknod` -- the two create-family entries
     whose ledgers CLOSE.  They are one arm twice over: identical premise
     lists (the icache's four ties, the block layer's nine geometry facts,
     mkfs's inode geometry and the printk credential pair ialloc's
     out-of-inodes arm needs) and identical resource lists, differing only in
     how many syscall arguments they read -- one for mkdir, three for mknod.

     WHAT USED TO BLOCK THEM was debt (A) in this file's header, and only
     half of it: create returned its slot ledger as the INTERVAL
     [ns - create_slots <= ns' <= ns], while `wp_syscall_sconf_body` hands
     out [iref_slots IREFSPARE] and must get IREFSPARE back -- it must,
     because [UsertrapRes.ut_own] carries the allowance at that literal and
     the trap loop gets its residue back unchanged, so a leak of one unit per
     mkdir would break the Löb invariant.  The header also recorded that the
     fact was TRUE and only the statement weak, and that tightening it was
     create's job.  It is done: [SpecCreate]'s post states the figure
     exactly ([if ok then S ns' = ns else ns' = ns]) -- all nine of its
     continuation sites already computed it and then weakened -- so
     mkdir's and mknod's own posts say [ns' = ns] and this arm can pass the
     whole allowance in and take the whole allowance out.

     NO SPLIT of [iref_slots], unlike the chdir/link/unlink arms: create
     wants [create_slots = 3] and IREFSPARE is 4, so the entry takes the
     ledger whole.  Both superblock cells create needs beyond the two in
     the old closer bundle -- [sb_ninodes] and [sb_size] -- come off [fs_ready] at
     [DfracDiscarded], which is the second of the four rows the old
     twenty-five-conjunct environment could not state at all. *)

  (* ENTRY 15, `open`.  The create-family shape (`mkdir`/`mknod`) with two
     differences, both of them visible in the [with] list:

       - it takes ONE of the four spare fd units.  sys_open holds a
         reference in a local [struct file *f] between filealloc and
         fdalloc, and hands the unit back either way -- installed in the
         descriptor on success, freed by fileclose on the D-FAIL arm --
         which is why [sysc_ret_tail] gets [FDSPARE] again.
       - it needs [is_ftable], because filealloc, fdalloc and fileclose all
         run inside it.  It comes off the environment like everything else
         ([syscall_env_all]'s fifth conjunct, whose lock ghost is [γft]).

     THE IREF LEDGER USED TO BLOCK THIS ENTRY.  sys_open's contract said
     `ns - sys_open_slots <= ns' <= ns`, and this dispatch lends [IREFSPARE]
     and must get [IREFSPARE] back, so no instantiation could close.  The
     interval was an artefact: publishing a file releases the untyped
     entry's own unit in exchange for the inode reference it parks, so
     nothing is spent -- see [SpecSysOpen]'s post.  With the equality the
     arm is the same three lines every other create-family entry is. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
  (* THE PRINTK FALLBACK (unknown syscall number), +0x40 .. +0x56, falling
     THROUGH into the shared epilogue -- it needs no [c.j], the block sits
     immediately above +0x58.

       printk("%d %s: unknown sys call %d\n", p->pid, p->name, num);
       p->trapframe->a0 = -1;

     Three things make it unlike a table arm.  (1) It reads [p] out of s1,
     not s2, at all three memory accesses ([&p->name] at +0x40, [p->pid] at
     +0x44, [p->trapframe] at +0x52), so the caller has to say what s1 holds
     -- a premise no returning arm needs, since those reach the trapframe
     through s2.  (2) The third vararg [num] is [a3], computed at +0x1a
     BEFORE the range check and never touched since; it costs nothing, since
     [PkANum]'s [pk_desc_res] is [True] and printk's contract constrains no
     vararg it is not told to walk.  (3) [p->name] is the one argument that
     does cost something: printk WALKS it, so it must be a real C string, and
     [ProcDefs.pname_cells] carries exactly that ([ProcGeom.pname_wf], "there
     is a NUL in the sixteen bytes", established at every write site).
     [CstringInv.bytes_string_split] turns it into the C string plus padding,
     and [sysc_pname_app] turns those bytes into the [string_pointsto]
     printk's [PkAStr] wants.  None of it is assumed.

     The WEAK general corollary [wp_printk_gen_sconf] is what is called (the
     one procdump's own loop uses): syscall makes no claim about what reached
     the UART, so the trace-carrying contract's accepted-trace postcondition
     would be pure overhead.  [printk_env] comes out of [syscall_env], the
     "pr" rank premise out of [cpu_own 0], and the 48-slot budget out of
     [K_syscall]'s own 82. *)

     An in-range number whose mask bit is clear runs nothing and answers -1:
     it IS the unknown-number call, minus the diagnostic.  The effective
     number is 0 ([UsysMemOk.usys_eff]), so every row of the post is the
     quiet one at 0 and the deposit is dropped. *)

     `sysc_arm_goal`, the trapframe-extraction/bitvector-bridge lemmas, and
     `sysc_epilogue_tail`) is assembled here with the real PROLOGUE (frame
     push, the `myproc()` call, the two trapframe reads, the fused range
     check driving the data-dependent `k`, the address computation, the
     table read, the redundant `beqz`, the `c.jalr`) into a full dispatch:
     every one of the 22 table entries reaches `sysc_arm_goal k` for its
     own `k`, discharged by `sysc_arm_dispatch` -- twenty-two real arms, no
     placeholder and no `Admitted`.  A new arm would be one more
     `decide (k = <literal>)` branch inside that combinator and NOTHING here
     would move. *)

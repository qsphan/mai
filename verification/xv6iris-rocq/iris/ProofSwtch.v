(* ProofSwtch.v -- the proof of swtch()'s sconf-tier context-switch spec
   (SpecSwtch.v), as a sealed module.  swtch calls nothing, so SwtchProof takes
   no functor arguments.

   Plan (mirrors the retired smode-config wp_swtch proof that lived in
   WpSwtchVc.v, over the same decode facts / VCgen run, with three changes):

   - CONFIG: the caller hands the [swconf] bundle; the proof unbundles
     [sconf γ] into the raw CSR resources and runs the plain (non-sp-
     tracking) engine [wp_vc_block_s_den_r strans_regime] -- swtch
     loads sp from memory, which the sp-tracking sconf VCgen cannot model.
     The translation slot rides FOLDED through the regime-blind engines
     (no skolem root is ever opened), so swtch is provable at either regime.
     The SIE=0 pin comes from [swconf]'s interrupts-off eighth [intr_off_tok]
     agreeing with [sconf]'s tied half (the crossing is always interrupts-off;
     the counting token itself rides in the chain payload); MPRV/SXL/MXR from
     [sconf_ms_facts]; menvcfg is pinned MENVCFG_S by the bundle.  The eighth /
     [hart_state] / [strans_inv] ride through untouched and are re-bundled at
     both exits.

   - ▷ TARGET: the [valid_context newc] premise is ▷-guarded.  At entry,
     [fupd_wp] + [later_exist_except_0] + timelessness strip the two pure
     facts and the (timeless) [ctx_cells]; the non-timeless resume wand
     stays under ▷ until the final c.ret, discharged with the later-handing
     leaf [wp_cret_s_zca_r_later] (WpSmodePtCtl.v) -- the [iNext] there
     strips it.

   - PAYLOAD: P is seven-place (resuming hart + its SIE ghost, the resumer
     record's admissibility index, resumed ctx, resumer ctx, resumer tp, the
     record's own c->proc index); the proof supplies
     [P cpu_id γ Ao newc oldc (m0 !!! x4) p] and must show x4 threads
     through the block unchanged (x4 is not among swtch_regs1's keys), and
     hands the resumed party [ctx_cells newc new_vs] back through the wand
     (the block only reads new's cells; [swtch_heap1] returns them intact). *)

(* SpecItrunc.v -- the public interface of itrunc, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void itrunc(struct inode *ip) {
       int i, j;
       struct buf *bp;
       uint *a;

       for (i = 0; i < NDIRECT; i++) {
         if (ip->addrs[i]) {
           bfree(ip->dev, ip->addrs[i]);
           ip->addrs[i] = 0;
         }
       }

       if (ip->addrs[NDIRECT]) {
         bp = bread(ip->dev, ip->addrs[NDIRECT]);
         a = (uint * )bp->data;
         for (j = 0; j < NINDIRECT; j++) {
           if (a[j])
             bfree(ip->dev, a[j]);
         }
         brelse(bp);
         bfree(ip->dev, ip->addrs[NDIRECT]);
         ip->addrs[NDIRECT] = 0;
       }

       ip->size = 0;
       iupdate(ip);
     }

   148 bytes, 53 instructions.  Two loops -- twelve direct entries, then the
   256 entries of the indirect block, read through a bread/brelse pair --
   followed by the indirect block's own free, [ip->size = 0] and the flush.
   Note the compiler saves s4 CONDITIONALLY: [sd s4,0(sp)] sits at +0x50,
   inside the indirect arm, and is restored at +0x90, so the direct-only
   path never touches it.

   THE CONTRACT.  itrunc empties the inode: [inode_map] comes back at
   [InodeInv.bm_empty], every block the map named goes back to the free pool
   (into [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], via bfree), the size is zeroed and the
   whole thing is flushed by the tail call to iupdate.  The postcondition is
   stated at the CLOSED value [bm_empty] rather than at "some map whose
   slots are all zero" so that iput -- the only caller -- needs no reasoning
   to see the inode names nothing.

   THE BUDGET IS THE INTERESTING PART, and it is why the log ledger had to
   change first.  itrunc calls bfree up to NDIRECT + NINDIRECT + 1 = 269
   times and then iupdate once.  Charging a unit per log_write -- the old
   always-consume accounting -- would demand 270 against a MAXOPBLOCKS of
   10, which no caller could supply.  But [FSSIZE = 2000 < BPB = 8192] means
   there is exactly ONE bitmap block, so all 269 frees hit it and the log
   ABSORBS every one after the first: the true cost is 2, one bitmap block
   and one inode block.  The credited arms of log_write and bfree
   ([LogInv.log_opS], [SpecBfree.wp_bfree_gen]) are what let that be stated.

   [bm_paid] below is the shape the loops carry.  It says "the bitmap
   block's log slot is paid for, and u units remain for everything else",
   as a disjunction over whether the payment has happened yet -- and it is
   IDEMPOTENT under bfree: the unpaid arm spends its spare unit and becomes
   paid, the paid arm presents its credit and absorbs.  So itrunc's loop
   invariant is literally [bm_paid γ bmapstart 1] -- one unit held back for
   iupdate -- unchanged across all 269 calls, with no data-dependent case
   split on which free happened to be the first.

   SPEND-AT-MOST-TWO, AT-LEAST-ONE.  The exit is [∃ u', u <= u' <= S u], the
   same shape bmap uses: iupdate always runs, so one unit is certainly
   spent; the bitmap unit is spent only if the inode named any block at all.

   itrunc SLEEPS (bread, and bfree's own bread), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecBfree.v / SpecIupdate.v do.  It
   enters and returns at noff 0.

   NOT ITS BUSINESS: ip->lock.  The C comment says "Caller must hold
   ip->lock", and the caller does -- iput takes the sleeplock before
   calling.  itrunc itself performs no locking, so the contract simply takes
   the inode's resources directly, exactly as iupdate's does. *)

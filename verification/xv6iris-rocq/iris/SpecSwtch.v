(* SpecSwtch.v -- the public interface of Swtch, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer (SwtchCtx.v) -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

   swtch(old,new) with the coroutine-chain protocol: consume the ▷-guarded
   [valid_context P An newc] (▷ because a scheduler can only ever RE-store a
   parked context under ▷ -- its own swtch delivered it that way) plus the
   chain payload [P cpu_id Ao newc oldc tp p]; the machine ends up
   running new's saved WP.  The target's admissibility index [An] must admit
   THIS hart (the pure [adm An cpu_id] premise), and the caller's
   continuation is what the OLD record is built from, so it carries the index
   [Ao] that record is deposited at -- and is quantified over the hart [h]
   that record may later be resumed on.  The interface is
   FULL-BUNDLE on both sides: the caller hands its whole [sie_cap_gpr m0 av]
   and [cpu_own 1 eb p emp] -- both PINNED at [b = false]: [cpu_own]'s own
   [1] level unconditionally holds the ghost eighth at '0' (the [S _] arm of
   [IntrDefs.intr_count]), which forces any co-held [sie_cap]/[sie_arm]
   fragment to agree at [false] by ghost_var_frac agreement (exactly [Swconf]'s own
   reasoning in SwtchCtx.v) -- and its continuation (the content of
   [valid_context P Ao oldc]) receives, on a later resumption at hart [h],
   [sie_cap_gpr@h m av false p] at a fresh file [m] with its
   own saved image and its own [av], plus [cpu_own@h 1 eb' p emp false] at its
   own [p] and the resumer's [eb'], and the chain hand-off
   [▷ valid_context P A' cret ∗ P h A' oldc cret tp' p]
   (tp' = the resumer's x4, how the resumed code re-ties its per-CPU cells
   to its own tp -- read via [rget], never the raw map, since tp is pinned to
   the hart and not carried by [m]/[m0]).

   swtch itself never wraps its continuation in [wp_next]: the hart-crossing
   here is entirely the [valid_context]/[ctx_adm] admissibility protocol
   (SwtchCtx.v), not an ordinary trapped step. *)

     re-attaches), a fresh file with its saved image, [cpu_own] at the SAME

     of it.  So the set is a CONSTANT here, exactly as the level [1] is, and
     the resumer gets the same constant back.  Quantifying it instead (as an
     [lks'] the resumer invents) is what left the seam unprovable: a

(* THE RESIDUE-TOKEN ACCESSOR PREMISE (tso-port M2 / A6.61's user half).
   The class's fetch/execute bridges pay the memory ledger with the
   thread's running token, which across a user excursion lives in the
   parked residue ([UsertrapRes.ut_trap_parked]'s [own_context cur_ctx]
   conjunct, riding inside [Rut pt]).  The closed theorem is quantified
   over [Rut], so the borrow accessor is a PREMISE: the concrete caller
   supplies it from its residue (a two-line borrow at [ut_trap_parked]),
   and the generic inhabitant on this SC leg mints it
   ([TsoCtxShim.rut_ctx_sc]). *)

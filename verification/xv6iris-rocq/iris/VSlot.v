     pinned payload it is about to write; for an IN request the content the
     block already has (the driver owns the disk points-to, so it knows).
     Recording it for IN too is what makes [slot_pend_res]'s disk fragments
     identifiable when the publisher collects its payoff -- an existentially
     quantified list there would come back opaque and no read could be tied
     back to the caller's [disk_block]. *)

  (* THE CRASH-PERMIT KEY (PermInv.v; claude-notes/design/fs-log.md stage 4).
     Every published request carries a permit -- an OUT request the client's
     real one, an IN request the trivial identity ([disk_write_permit True]),
     which is why this is a PAIR and not an option: keeping it uniform is
     what keeps the completion direction-agnostic (the completing slot is
     chosen inside [virtio_proto_step], so its caller cannot case-split on
     the direction).  [fst] is the permit invariant's map key, [snd] is the
     saved-proposition gname that pins the client's receipt.  PURE DATA, so
     the slot stays timeless and rides [disk_inv] -- that is the whole point
     of the split, and the [vs_data] rule again: an exclusive resource taken
     across a sleep must be IDENTIFIED in the record the invariant keys on,
     or the woken publisher gets it back opaque.
     Spelled [positive] because this file is deliberately iris-free;
     [gname := positive], so every consumer reads it as a gname.
     ONE key per request (sector-atomic-disk.md §6e): the cell it names
     holds the whole SEQUENTIAL permit and is re-indexed at every sector
     landing, so nothing about the slot has to grow with the sector count. *)

(* FdSlots.v -- the fd-slot resource: the capability that bounds how many
   references to one [struct file] can exist at once, and hence the reason
   xv6's unchecked [f->ref++] in filedup cannot overflow.

   The argument is a conservation law, and it is subtle enough to be worth
   spelling out:

     every holder of a reference to a struct file is a file descriptor of
     some process; there are at most NPROC processes and at most NOFILE
     descriptors each; NPROC * NOFILE is ~1000, which is nowhere near 2^31.

   Nothing in file.c enforces that -- it is a whole-kernel invariant -- so it
   has to be carried as a RESOURCE.  [fd_slot] is one unit of "somewhere to
   put a file reference".  The supply is fixed at [FDSLOTS] and minted once,
   at boot, by [fd_slots_alloc]; the proc layer distributes them to the
   NPROC * NOFILE descriptor slots.  A descriptor that names a file has GIVEN
   its slot away -- [ftable_res] holds one per outstanding reference (see
   FileInv.v) -- and gets it back when the descriptor is closed.  So

     (references to file k)  <=  (fd slots in existence)  =  FDSLOTS

   falls straight out of [own γ (● FDSLOTS)] against the fragments the table
   holds, with no arithmetic and no local update: the tokens for one slot are
   literally [◯ n], and [◯ n ⋅ ◯ 1 = ◯ (S n)].

   The resource lives here rather than in FileInv.v because it is a
   proc/fd-layer notion that the file table merely CONSUMES: the eventual
   [proc]-side model of [p->ofile[]] is the other end of the same law, and
   both sides should name the same thing. *)

   between filealloc and fdalloc; sys_pipe holds two (SpecSysPipe.v takes them
   as premises and returns both on every one of its four exits).  Any
   comfortable constant would do; this one is the honest count.

   It is routed exactly like the per-descriptor units: procinit parks it in
   each process's [ProcInv.proc_dormant], allocproc takes it out with the
   block, and it travels ALONGSIDE [proc_priv] for a live process -- not
   inside it.  Beside rather than inside because [proc_priv]'s accessors all
   have the borrow-and-return shape, whose wand swallows the block: a syscall

   [IcacheInv] once [inode_ref] stops being a placeholder.  That one import

(* ===================================================================== *)

(* The second thing this file carries, and the other end of the law above:
   [fd_slot] counts descriptors so that [f->ref] cannot overflow; [fd_st]
   says what the descriptor IS.  A process's descriptor table has NOFILE
   entries and every one of them is in exactly one of two states -- CLOSED
   (the cell is null) or OPEN, naming a file of some type.  That is what a
   USER program sees of the kernel's file layer: open(2) hands back a
   descriptor of a known type, read(2) on a pipe blocks where read(2) on an
   inode does not, close(2) makes the number free again.  Nothing in
   [ProcInv.proc_priv] could state any of it, because the type lives inside
   [ofile_slot]'s existential [fcontent] and the array is a list of raw
   pointers.

   So: ONE GHOST VARIABLE PER DESCRIPTOR, in two halves.

   * the AUTHORITY ([fd_st_auth]) rides with the descriptor array inside
     [ProcInv.proc_ofiles], where it is pinned to the cell and to the type
     of the file the cell names -- so it cannot drift from the machine;
   * the FRAGMENT ([fd_st]) is what a client holds and reasons from.  Both
     halves currently sit in the process invariant ([fd_st_both]); the
     fragment is what will later be handed OUT, to user-space proofs that
     want to say "fd 1 is the console" across a syscall.

   Two halves rather than an auth/frag pair because that is exactly the
   power wanted: either half alone pins the state ([fd_st_agree]) and
   NEITHER half alone can move it -- an update needs both ([fd_st_both_update]),
   i.e. the kernel cannot silently retype a descriptor a client is holding,
   and a client cannot invent a state change without the kernel's step.

   PER PROCESS INCARNATION, NOT PER SLOT.  The name [γ] is minted fresh by
   allocproc and dropped when the process dies (kexit's ZOMBIE, freeproc's
   UNUSED) -- the same discipline the trapframe page follows, and for the
   same reason: a proc SLOT is recycled, so a fragment minted for the
   process that used to live in slot [i] must not say anything about the
   process that lives there now.  A name-per-slot minted at boot would be
   exactly that hazard.  The consequence is that nothing about the fd state
   appears in [ProcDefs.proc_dormant] -- a dormant slot has no process,
   hence no descriptors -- and that boot routes nothing.  The name lives in
   [ProcDefs.pprivate] as [pv_fdg], beside the field values, so that every
   spec that already threads a process's private state can NAME the
   process's descriptors without a new parameter.

   A GMAP UNDER ONE NAME, not NOFILE separate [ghost_var_frac]s: a list of
   sixteen ghost names would have to be allocated, threaded and kept in
   step with the array, and every lemma about one descriptor would carry
   the list.  With a gmap the per-descriptor resource is a singleton
   fragment, [fd_st γ fd st], and the whole table is minted in one
   [own_alloc] ([fd_st_alloc]).  NO AUTHORITY on the gmap: an exclusive
   holder ([q = 1]) can retype its own key by a frame-preserving update
   with nothing else in hand, which is what lets the fd-table surgery in
   [ProcInv] stay a local step.  (This is [FileInvDefs.fpay_tok]'s
   construction, and its header argues the point at length.) *)

(* file.h's four [type] codes, minus FD_NONE, which is not a state a
   DESCRIPTOR can be in: a descriptor either names a typed file or is
   closed.  [FdDevice]'s [major] is what distinguishes the console
   (CONSOLE = 1) from any other device file.

   [FdInode] CARRIES ITS INUM, because "fd 3 is open on an inode" is not
   what a client wants to know -- it wants to know WHICH FILE, and on this
   file system a file IS its inum.  It is not free: [fcontent] records
   [f->ip], the itable ENTRY, and an entry is recycled, so the inum has to
   come from the inode reference the file holds.  It does
   ([IcacheHeld.inode_shr_held_gen], through [FileInvDefs.inode_pay], the
   [fp_inum] field of [fpnames], and [FileInvDefs.file_ref]'s state index)
   -- the share already pinned it, through a points-to on the entry's own
   [i_inum] cell; naming it is what this costs.

   A [Z], like [FdDevice]'s major and for the same reason: these are the
   numbers a USER program reads, and the machine widths belong on the
   kernel side of the boundary.  [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok] is where the two
   meet, and it does the [bv_unsigned].

   [FdInode] ALSO CARRIES THE NAME OF ITS OFFSET GHOST.  [f->off] is the
   one mutable field of a [struct file], and it is per FILE, not per
   descriptor: every fd that names the file (dup, fork) shares it.  The
   name [γo] is that of a [ghost_var_frac] over [Z] whose value IS the current
   [f->off] ([FileOffCell.off_resident] owns it whole, beside the cell,
   inside the file's off box), minted fresh at every FD_INODE publish
   ([ProofSysOpenParts.so_deposit]) and never reused: a closed file's
   name simply goes dead, and the next open of the same slot mints a new
   one.  It is tied to the payload's [fpnames.fp_ooff] by
   [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok]'s FD_INODE arm.  Pipes and devices have no
   meaningful offset and carry no name. *)
(* [FdInode] ALSO RECORDS WHOSE THE OFFSET IS (design/user-read.md SS3's
   RULING, SS8.1).  There is exactly ONE user half of [OffGv.off_gv], so a
   descriptor's row family can carry [OffGv.off_user_inv] only while that
   half is PARKED in it; a descriptor whose half has been HANDED to the
   program ([UserOff.uoff]) has no invariant and its row must claim
   nothing.  Putting the choice in the STATE is the only shape that keeps
   [foff_row] both PERSISTENT and A PURE FUNCTION OF THE STATE, which is
   what every site that threads [fd_frags] opaquely relies on -- and it is
   design/user-read.md SS3's arm dispatch for free: "held inode" is the arm
   whose payment is the program's own [uoff].

   TODAY EVERY CONSTRUCTOR SITE WRITES [OffParked] and the file invariant
   PINS it ([FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok]'s FD_INODE arm), so the kernel meets
   no held descriptor and its proofs are byte-for-byte what they were.
   Mode [hand] is wired at the enriched open row by the next lane. *)

(* [FdPipe] CARRIES ITS PIPE'S GHOST NAMES (design/pipe.md, "The byte
   queue"): [pn_queue] is the byte queue whose authority the kernel keeps
   inside [pi->lock] and whose exact fragment [sys_pipe] hands the process
   -- what a program's read/write/close links are stated on -- and the four
   end names beside it.  Tied to the payload's [fp_pipe] by
   [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok]'s pipe arm exactly as [FdInode]'s [γo] is tied
   to the offset shadow.  The two ends of one pipe carry the SAME record,
   which is how a descriptor table says they are ends of the same pipe. *)
Inductive fdtype :=
| FdInode (inum : Z) (γo : gname) (om : offmode)
| FdPipe (γp : pipe_names)
| FdDevice (major : Z).

(* THE TWO MODE FLAGS RIDE ON [FdOpen], NOT ON THE TYPE.  [f->readable] and
   [f->writable] are fields of every [struct file] whatever its type, so
   putting them on each constructor would be the same pair written three
   times -- and every consumer that only cares about the mode would have to
   match on the type to find it.

   They are what a descriptor's user most wants after "which file": whether
   a read or a write on this fd can succeed at all.  fileread returns -1 on
   [f->readable == 0] before it looks at the type, and filewrite likewise on
   [f->writable]; both tests are now facts about the STATE.

   On a PIPE the pair is not a mode but an IDENTITY: pipealloc's two files
   differ in nothing else -- same type, same [f->pipe] -- so the flags are
   the whole of what says which end a descriptor holds.  [FdOpen true false
   FdPipe] is the read end and [FdOpen false true FdPipe] the write end,
   which is how sys_pipe's postcondition still says that fd[0] reads and
   fd[1] writes.

   Both are tied to their cells by [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok], at the C
   reading: the field holds 1 when the flag is set and 0 when it is not,
   which is what open() and pipealloc() actually store. *)

  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* One process's NOFILE fragments, as a single resource.  This is the
     other end of the split: [ProcInv.ofile_slot] keeps the AUTHORITY beside
     the cell it describes, and everything a holder of the block might want
     to SAY about its descriptors is here.

     WHY A WHOLE-ARRAY BUNDLE rather than per-descriptor fragments handed
     around one at a time.  A syscall does not know which descriptor it will
     touch until it has read its argument (sys_close), or until fdalloc has
     scanned (sys_open, sys_pipe, sys_dup), so a contract stated at ONE [fd]
     could not be written down at the call.  The bundle is also what a
     client will eventually hold: "my file descriptors" is one assertion,
     not sixteen.

     WHY IT TRAVELS BESIDE THE BLOCK, not inside it.  Same reason
     [FDSPARE]'s allowance does, one paragraph up: [proc_priv]'s accessors
     are all borrow-and-return and their wands swallow the block, so a
     syscall that held the bundle *out* of [proc_priv] could not then pass
     [proc_priv] to a callee.  Its home is [UsertrapRes.ut_own], on the same
     in-and-out channel [ut_own] already gives [fd_slots] and [bslots], and
     from there it rides across user execution inside
     [ProofUserretClosed.Rut_at] for free.  The next increment lifts it OUT
     of that residue so userret can hand it to a verified user program
     instead of parking it. *)
  (* =================================================================== *)
  (*  THE OFFSET-SHADOW ROW FAMILY                                        *)
  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* Beside each descriptor's FRAGMENT the bundle carries what the process
     holds of that descriptor's OFFSET: for an FD_INODE row, the user half
     of the file's offset ghost parked in an existential invariant
     ([OffGv.off_user_inv] -- the process this bundle belongs to is managed
     by the generic user-mode WP, knows nothing of its offsets, and lets
     the kernel move them freely); nothing for a pipe, a device or a closed
     slot.  PERSISTENT, so a forked child's copy of the table (kfork
     retypes the child's rows at the parent's list) carries the same
     invariants at no cost, and a dup of a row carries its source's.

     A ROW, NOT A GNAME: it is keyed by the STATE, so the family is a pure
     function of the list the bundle is already indexed by, and every site
     that threads the bundle opaquely is untouched.  The sites that RETYPE
     a row pay for the new row's entry: open mints the invariant from the
     half the publish returned; dup copies the source's; close, pipe and
     kfork's closed rows owe nothing.

     AND THE PER-ROW POLICY IS HERE NOW, as [FdInode]'s own [offmode]
     field: a verified process that KEEPS its half holds a descriptor
     whose state records [OffHeld], and that row claims nothing.  Putting
     the choice in the state rather than beside the family is what keeps
     the two properties above -- persistence and being a function of the
     list -- which a per-row resource parameter would have destroyed.  No
     held descriptor exists yet: [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok] pins every live
     inode row at [OffParked], and relaxing that pin is the enriched open
     row's business (design/user-read.md SS8.2). *)
  Context `{!riscvGS Σ, !offboxG Σ}.

  (* KEYED BY THE MODE THE STATE RECORDS (design/user-read.md SS8.1): a
     PARKED inode row claims the invariant, exactly as every inode row did
     before the mode existed; a HELD one claims NOTHING, because its half
     is in the program's hands and there is only one.  Both properties the
     family is load-bearing for survive: it is still PERSISTENT (so a
     forked child's copy and a dup cost nothing) and still A PURE FUNCTION
     OF THE STATE (so every site that threads [fd_frags] opaquely is
     untouched). *)

  (* [fd_frags_any] (below) IS THE FORGETFUL READING OF THIS BUNDLE, and it

     [SpecSysPipe] and [SpecSysOpen]'s post, [ProcInv]'s array bridge,
     [UsysMemOk]'s loop invariant, [UsertrapRes]'s weakening.

     WHAT IT COSTS, so a caller chooses deliberately.  The weakening
     DISCARDS a value the producer had in hand, and once discarded it
     cannot be recovered, since [fd_frags_any] pins the length and nothing
     else.  Every use of it is a place where a caller is told less than the
     callee knew.

     THE WORKED EXAMPLE IS FORK, WHERE BOTH ENDS NAME THE LIST INSTEAD.
     allocproc's mint proves [fd_frags γ fdt0]; kfork's copy loop retypes
     the child's ghost one descriptor at a time, at the state the PARENT's
     own list records; and the park is keyed at the list that comes out.
     While either end forgot -- the mint on the line after it, or the
     loop's invariant -- a forked child's descriptors were unstateable,
     which is what parked sh's command-tree runner
     (claude-notes/design/user-fd.md SS4).

     A client that wants to state a DELTA ("fd 3 is closed now") takes

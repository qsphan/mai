       struct inode *ip;

   [s5 = dev], [s1 = inum], [s4 = &sb], [s6 = the format string],
   [s2 = bp], [s3 = inum sign-extended, then REUSED for ip].

   ---- THREE THINGS THE DECODE DOES THAT NO OTHER fs FUNCTION DOES ------

   (i) TWO RETURN SITES.  [c.jr ra] at +0xc4 (the real epilogue) and again at
   +0xc6.  The second one is reached from the [bgeu a5,a4] at +0x0a -- BEFORE
   the [c.addi16sp sp,-64] at +0x0e -- so it returns with THE FRAME NEVER
   PUSHED.  It is ialloc's +0x12 arm at a different offset and it is DEAD for
   the same reason: [1 < ninodes] refutes it (SpecIalloc.v's header, and
   SpecBalloc's [0 < size] before that).  So this contract has ONE live exit
   and, like ialloc's, a uniform epilogue.

   (ii) THE LOOP IS ENTERED IN THE MIDDLE.  [c.j +70] at +0x36 jumps past the
   STEP block (+0x6e..+0x7a) straight to the loop BODY at +0x7c.  An invariant
   stated at the body's top is therefore arrived at twice with different
   histories, and the first arrival is a special case -- the proof's business,
   but it is why the scan cannot be [ProofIalloc.ia_scan] verbatim.

   (iii) THE BUFFER IS HELD ACROSS iget.  [jal iget] at +0x44 runs while
   bread's reference from +0x8c is still outstanding; [jal brelse] at +0x4c
   only gives it back AFTERWARDS.  The slot accounting has to cover that, and
   [beq s3,zero] at +0x50 -- the C source's [if(ip)] -- is DEAD, refuted by
   iget's POSTCONDITION ([mr !!! a0 = ientry k]) and not by any premise of
   this contract.

   ---- WHAT ireclaim IS, AS A CONTRACT: THE UNION OF ITS CALLEES ---------

   ireclaim allocates no policy of its own.  Everything it does is a call, so
   its precondition is the union of nine proven ones -- bread, brelse, printk,
   iget, begin_op, ilock, iunlock, iput, end_op -- and its postcondition is
   "everything back".  It returns [void] and it is SINGLE-ARMED: both live
   paths through the loop body end at the same +0xc4.

   Three couplings inside that union are worth naming, because they are what
   make the union CLOSE rather than merely large:

   - THE LEDGER UNIT.  [iget] spends exactly one [iref_slot] and [iput]
     returns exactly one, so a single unit rides the whole scan and comes
     back at the end.  This is dirlookup's discipline; here the two halves
     are in the SAME function, which is why the contract is not two-armed.

   - THE LOG RESERVATION IS BORN AND DIES INSIDE.  [begin_op] mints
     [log_op γ MAXOPBLOCKS] and [end_op] retires it, so -- unlike ialloc,
     iupdate and iput -- NO [log_op] crosses this contract's boundary in
     either direction.  [iput_units = 3 <= MAXOPBLOCKS = 10] is what makes
     the reclaim arm affordable, and it is a closed numeric fact rather than
     a premise.

   - THE REFERENCE IS CARVED AND GATHERED.  [iget] pays out
     [inode_ref k q dev inum]; [ilock] wants an [inode_shr], which
     [IcacheRef.inode_ref_shed] carves off; [iunlock] gives the share back
     and [IcacheRef.inode_ref_gather] restores the reference, which [iput]
     then spends.  Nothing about that crosses the boundary either.

   So the only resources that genuinely FLOW are the buffer slots
   (returned); the bitmap iput frees into is the persistent
   [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv].

   ---- THE ENTRY SLEEPLOCKS ARE A FAMILY, NOT A SINGLETON ---------------

   ilock, iunlock and iput each take [is_sleeplock] for THEIR OWN entry, and
   a caller that knows its slot hands over exactly one.  ireclaim does not
   know its slot: [iget] chooses it at run time and the scan cannot name it in
   advance.  So this contract takes [IcacheEscrow.ic_sleeplocks fsc_ic] -- the
   fifty-fold persistent family -- with [IcacheEscrow.ic_sleeplocks_lookup]
   to project the one the run picks.  There is one copy of each.

   ---- THE BOOT MINT FITS THIS CONTRACT UNCHANGED (C7's flag, resolved) --

   fs-icache C7 flagged ireclaim as "the pool's initial-contents authority",
   i.e. the function that would have to say what the mkfs image's inodes
   contain.  Under fs-icache.md §16.5 it does not: the pool's FREE arm is
   just [imark], the boot mint is [IcacheBoot.icache_boot] and it already
   produces exactly the four persistent things this contract takes
   ([is_itable2], [itable_inv], [ic_escrows], plus the sleeplock family) at
   the ALL-EMPTY table.  ireclaim consumes them as premises and mints
   nothing.  The image-wf IOUs ([IcacheBoot.ipool_alloc]'s allocated-inum
   bundles, [InodeLock.inode_ok], [DirView.dir_ok]) stay where they are --
   sealed inside the pool by the boot client -- and this contract neither
   states nor discharges them.  NOTHING HAD TO MOVE.

   ---- WHAT IS *NOT* HERE, AND WHERE IT IS ------------------------------

   The superblock geometry premises ([1 < ninodes], [ninodes <= 16 * nib],
   [ninodes < 2^31], and inodestart's / bmapstart's coverage) are THREADED,
   exactly as SpecIalloc.v threads its three.  Their home is [SpecFsinit]:
   fsinit's [memmove] at +0x26 is where every superblock cell is born, so
   that is the only place they can be about anything.

   ireclaim SLEEPS (bread, and begin_op's two sleeps), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecIalloc.v / SpecIput.v do, and takes
   the parking premise.  It enters and returns at noff 0.

(* THE FUNCTOR.  A pair: the two VALUES the generation pins (its slot
   address and its pid, at [leibnizO] because both are discrete machine
   words) and the PREDICATE it saves (the exit payload, indexed by the exit
   status).  [constOF] on the left is what keeps the values out of the
   step-indexing: agreement on them is a PURE equality with no later,
   which is what [gen_agree] hands its callers. *)
(* ...AND THE THREE THINGS A GENERATION RECORDS BESIDES ITS PAYLOAD (lane
   SELF-KILL, §3a).

   [ga]  THE TAKEN TOKEN'S GHOST NAME, in the PURE component beside the
         slot and the pid, so agreement on it is a plain equality with no
         later.  It cannot be the generation's own name: [gn] is
         [saved_anything_alloc]'s, and no [own_alloc] variant targets a
         chosen name, so an exclusive token AT [gn] is not allocatable.
         The token itself is [taken_tok] below -- linear, exclusive, minted
         with the incarnation into the process's PRIVATE BLOCK, and what
         the exit path leaves in [SchedCtx]'s killed row when it takes the
         payment out of it: "killed and spent".  Once the row holds it a
         second taking is impossible, and the process cannot forge the
         payment back.
   THERE IS NO CREDENTIAL FIELD AND NO PAYMENT RULE HERE (coordinator,
   2026-09-13).  What a kill of this process costs is its OWN EXIT PAYLOAD
   AT -1, which this generation already tracks, so the predicate [K] of the
   earlier design and the opaque payment rule [Kp] that replaced it are
   both gone: [kill_owed] below is stated at [Q], and HOW a killer who
   holds only the application's supply pays is published by
   [SchedCtx.kill_paid] as the wand [□ (AppInv.app_sup -∗ Q (-1))] beside
   the persistent [my_pay] -- at an altitude where [app_sup] is nameable,
   which this one is not (this file requires stdpp, iris and Sail and
   nothing of the application). *)
(* ...AND THE FOURTH FIELD IS THE KILL FLAG'S ONE-SHOT (lane SELF-KILL,
   P6).  [p->killed] is set and never cleared while a process lives -- only
   freeproc zeroes it, and only on a slot whose process is already a ZOMBIE
   -- but <p->lock>'s payload quantifies the cell EXISTENTIALLY, so "the
   flag was nonzero a few instructions ago" is not a fact anything can
   carry across a release.  It has to be a GHOST fact, and a persistent
   one, because the party that reads the flag ([killed]) and the party that
   needs to know it ([kexit], which never reads it) are separated by two
   critical sections.
     [gk] is that ghost's name, in the PURE component beside the other
   two: PENDING while the row's zero arm holds it, SHOT the moment a writer
   sets the flag, and the shot half is persistent and duplicable, which is
   exactly what makes it relayable.  Its camera is [kshotR] below. *)

  (* THE ESCROW.  What a ZOMBIE slot holds for its parent: the kernel's
     quarter of the dead incarnation's generation, and the payload PAID at
     the status the slot's [p_xstate] cell now reads.

     WHY TWO PREDICATES AND NOT ONE.  The party that pays is the exiting
     PROCESS, and what it deposits at the trap boundary is its own
     [my_pay γ Q'] beside [Q' xs] ([UexecRet.uexec_dep_F] at [USYS_exit]):
     a slot may only ever name the payload it can prove it has, which is
     what the persistent half is.  The party that HOLDS the kernel's
     quarter is kexit, out of the dying process's private block
     ([ProcInv.proc_priv_core]), and its [Q] is bound by that block's own
     existential.  The two are THE SAME PREDICATE -- agreement of two
     pieces of one generation -- but only up to the saved predicate's
     later, so pairing them here rather than rewriting one into the other
     is what keeps kexit's park later-free.  [gen_pay] pays the ▷ once, at
     the reaper, where it costs nothing.

     A KILL IS PAID TOO, AND OUT OF THE SAME PAYLOAD.  A process that
     [kill] marked is torn down by the kernel at its next trap, which runs
     [exit(-1)] with the process's own continuation undelivered -- so
     nothing the PROGRAM does can pay at that moment.  What pays is what
     the program handed the kernel when it trapped: its run carries
     [UkRun.ukn_pay N (-1)] as a linear conjunct precisely so that the
     kernel can spend it on the kill path, and hands it back at every
     resume that is not one ([UexecRet.uexec_pay_dep] / [uexec_pay_arm]).
     So a parent gets [Q (-1)] whether its child called [exit(-1)] or was
     killed, and there is exactly one arm here.

     KEYED AT THE STORED STATUS.  [xs] is the value in the slot's
     [p_xstate] cell, whose other half rides this same block
     ([ProcDefs.proc_dormant]); the reaper holds [p->lock], so the half it
     reads through [SchedCtx.proc_pub] and the half beside this escrow
     agree, and the status it copies out to the parent IS this [xs]. *)

  (* ALLOCPROC's step, AND IT IS THE ONLY ONE (lane SELF-KILL, §4b',
     coordinator's ruling (A) of 2026-09-13).  A fresh incarnation of slot
     [pa] at the pid <allocpid> chose, AT THE PAYLOAD ITS CREATOR NAMES --
     the parent's choice for a forked child, the trivial one for <init>.

     WHY THE CHOICE MOVED HERE.  It used to be a two-step mint: allocproc
     made a WHOLE generation at the trivial payload and the fork row
     re-chose with [gen_set] before splitting.  That order is no longer
     possible.  [SchedCtx]'s killed row is per-INCARNATION now and
     allocproc is what stores the nonzero pid the row is keyed at, so
     allocproc has to CLOSE that row -- and the row names the generation
     PERSISTENTLY ([kpay], [my_pay]).  A persistent reading is a
     [DfracDiscarded] share, which only [gen_split] produces, and
     [gen_set] is [saved_anything_update] and needs [DfracOwn 1]:
     [DfracOwn 1 ⋅ DfracDiscarded] is invalid, so the whole and a reading
     cannot coexist.  Choosing at the mint dissolves the conflict, and
     nothing is lost -- the only thing [gen_set] ever did was re-choose a
     credential after allocation, and the credential IS the payload now.

     IT MINTS THE TAKEN TOKEN WITH IT.  The token's name goes into the
     element, so every later reading says which token belongs to this
     incarnation, and the token itself comes out beside the generation for
     whoever is building the process (it rides the private block). *)
  (* WHAT ALLOCPROC HANDS ITS CALLER, as ONE row: the three pieces of the

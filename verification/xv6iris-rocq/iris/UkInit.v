  (* init calls [wait] with a NULL status pointer, which is the only arm
     this tier can carry: the kernel's own [addr != 0] test means nothing
     is copied out, so the heap comes back untouched. *)
  (* AT THE INDEXED HALF, because this is the call init REDEEMS THROUGH.
     init forks one shell and waits for it; what it gets back on the
     reaping arm is the kernel's answer ([UexecRet.uwait_ans]) naming the
     generation that left the set, with that child's escrow and the pid
     uniqueness over the set the call went in at.  A parent holding
     [ChildTok.child_tok] for the shell it forked turns [r = its pid] into
     [γ' = the shell's generation] ([ChildTok.gen_uniq_tok]) and the escrow
     into the payload its fork chose ([ChildTok.gen_pay]); a parentless
     process reaped in its stead answers at a DIFFERENT generation, which
     the same token refutes ([ChildTok.exit_tok_tok_ne]), so the shell is
     still in the set the call left and init loops.  None of that is
     sayable at [UserChildren.uch_any]. *)
  (* ...AND THE ROW A RESUMING CALLER READS OFF ITS OWN -1 (lane M6b,
     "DIE-DW CORRECTED").  A process that comes back from wait was not
     killed (usertrap's second [killed] check exits it before the sret --
     [SpecUsertrap.ut_live_out]), and at a null status pointer the copyout
     exit cannot fire, so the ONLY -1 a user program ever sees is "my own
     child set is empty" -- which is what [UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_wait_null_live]
     hands over as [⌜ret = -1 -> cs' = ∅⌝].  init holds a token for the
     shell it forked, so the arm is refuted at the wait head and init's
     "init: wait returned an error" diagnostic is dead code

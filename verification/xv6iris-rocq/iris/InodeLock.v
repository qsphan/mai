(* InodeLock.v -- WHAT A WELL-FORMED IN-MEMORY INODE IS, and the two guard
   readings ilock's and iunlock's dead panics turn on.  Design:
   claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md §13.

   ---- WHAT USED TO BE HERE, AND WHERE IT WENT -------------------------

   This file used to hold the whole icache SEAM -- [inode_parked] (the
   resource an inode's sleeplock protected) and the [inode_key] ghost_var_frac
   shadow that named its existentially-quantified [dn]/[bm], plus
   [inode_locked], the bundle ilock produced.  All three are gone, and the
   design note records why:

   * the CONTENT no longer lives in the sleeplock at all.  It lives in
     [IcacheEscrow.ic_escrow], a three-armed per-entry escrow, because
     iget's recycle rewrites a slot's cells holding [itable.lock] and no
     sleeplock, so a sleeplock-only home was never reachable by every
     writer (§10, §13.1c).  The sleeplock keeps [ic_tok] and nothing else.
   * the SHADOW retires with it (§13.1).  Its coupling job is done by the
     arm's own [InodeRegion.dinode_at] fragment, pinned to the entry by the
     escrow's permanent half of [i_inum] (§13.1b); and its second job --
     letting a caller state ilock's on-disk agreement premise
     conditionally -- disappeared with that premise (§11.3).  It could not
     have survived in any case: with N reference holders only two
     [ghost_var_frac] halves exist, so "the caller supplies one" is
     unsatisfiable for the second holder.
   * [inode_locked] is now [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] plus the two identity
     halves and the valid cell -- i.e. exactly what [ic_swap_park] takes,
     which is what makes SpecIlock v2's postcondition literally
     SpecIunlock v2's precondition.

   What is left is pure, and shared by both sides of that seam.

   ---- WHAT A WELL-FORMED IN-MEMORY INODE IS ---------------------------

   [inode_ok] is the pure record ilock mints and every fs.c function above
   it consumes; [inode_raw] is the cell-shaped remains of an entry nobody
   has loaded yet (the escrow's unloaded arm); [valid_word] is the word in
   [ip->valid] and [valid_word_eqz] reads the cached/uncached branch off
   it. *)

(* WHAT A WELL-FORMED IN-MEMORY INODE IS.  Exactly the pure facts readi,
   writei and iupdate consume, plus the type test ilock's second panic
   needs.  A caller gets them OUT of ilock; nobody has to supply them.

   THE SIZE CAP (design/fs-icache.md §13.5) is the fifth conjunct and it is
   NOT derivable from the fourth: [bm_covers] only says that every block
   index BELOW MAXFILE whose byte range starts inside the file is mapped,
   and says nothing at all about a size above [MAXFILE * BSIZE].  Yet
   [SpecReadi.v] (and writei behind it) takes exactly that bound as a
   genuine premise -- a file claiming a larger size would drive bmap past
   MAXFILE and into its out-of-range panic.  Before the icache that premise
   was suppliable by a caller, because the caller named the [dn] it was
   handing ilock; under SpecIlock v2 the record is an OUTPUT, existentially
   bound in the postcondition, so a caller cannot constrain it and the fact
   has to travel WITH the record.  Stated over [Z], matching SpecReadi's own
   phrasing, so no [nat] literal is ever forced (durable-notes' unary-literal
   rule). *)

  (* EVERY BLOCK IS A BLOCK'S WORTH OF BYTES (design §6(ii), landed by
     §13.12(b)).  itrunc's [bfree] needs it of every block it frees, and
     under SpecIlock v2 [data] is an OUTPUT -- existentially bound inside
     [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] -- so iput cannot supply it as a premise and
     it has to travel WITH the record, exactly as §13.5's size cap does.
     [blk_holes_zero] above pins the length only at HOLES; the blocks
     itrunc frees are precisely the ALLOCATED indices, which is why the
     hole clause could not serve.  Producers re-establish it with
     [InodeInv.inode_sized_zero] / [_insert] / [_of_alloc]. *)

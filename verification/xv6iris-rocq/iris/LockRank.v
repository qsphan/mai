(* LockRank.v -- THE SPINLOCK ORDER, as a rank on the lock's NAME.

   xv6 orders its spinlocks by FAMILY, and a family is exactly the string
   passed to [initlock].  A hart may acquire a lock only while every lock it
   already holds ranks strictly BELOW it ([locks_below]), which is the classic
   deadlock-freedom discipline: the held set is a chain in a fixed total order,
   so no cycle of waiting harts can form.

   WHY THE NAME IS ENOUGH, AND NO LOCK-ADDRESS TIEBREAKER IS NEEDED.  Three
   families have more than one instance -- "proc" (NPROC of them), "pipe" (one
   per pipe) and "sleep lock" (the inner spinlock of every [struct sleeplock])
   -- and an audit of every acquire / sleep_prepare / sleep / wakeup /
   acquiresleep site in the kernel says no execution ever holds two members of
   any of them at once.  So a rank on the name alone totally orders every pair
   xv6 can actually hold, and [gset string] is the whole state.  The reasons are
   per-family and two of them are load-bearing rather than incidental -- see
   claude-notes/completed/lock-set.md, which also carries the edge table this
   ranking extends.

   A rank of 0 is the default for a name not in the table: such a lock may be
   acquired only from the empty held set, which is the conservative reading and
   never wrong, only restrictive.

   THE PREMISE IS WHAT DISCHARGES FRESHNESS.  [locks_below S r -> r ∉ S] is
   the whole reason the held set can stay a [gset] with a conditional insert:
   without it, acquire would need the [lk->cpu] cell to derive [lk ∉ S] (see
   LockSet.v's header for the shape that replaced). *)

(* The order, as the topological extension of every simultaneous-hold edge in
   the kernel.  Reading it bottom-up: the FS caches first, then the console
   stack, then the sleeper machinery, then [proc] (which every [sleep_prepare]
   and every [wakeup] acquires, so it sits above all of them), then the
   allocators, and finally the two panic-path locks.

   [pr] and the two [uart<i>] leaves sit above everything a panic can fire
   under, because
   [panic] takes [pr.lock]: this
   revision has no [panicking] flag, so panic is [printk] + [printk] +
   self-jump and printk holds [pr.lock] across [consputc] -> [uartputc_sync]
   -> [acquire(&tx_lock)].  Panic fires under nearly every lock, so nothing
   BELOW the two leaves may sit above them.  [uart] has no outgoing edge at
   all: [uartwrite] calls [sleep_prepare] before acquiring [tx_lock] and
   [sleep] after releasing it, and [uartintr] takes no lock.  Neither does
   [bcache]: [bget] RELEASES bcache.lock before its [acquiresleep].  Those
   two facts are what keep the graph acyclic.

   THE ONE UNLICENSED EDGE is [iput]: it holds itable.lock (14) across
   [acquiresleep] (4).  With [proc] below [itable] (kfork) and [sleep lock]
   below [proc] ([acquiresleep] -> [sleep_prepare]), there is no room to
   place [itable] between them -- so that site is justified by an argument
   rather than by rank, namely xv6's own comment at kernel/fs.c:339, "ip->ref
   == 1 means no other process can have ip locked, so this acquiresleep()
   won't block (or deadlock)".  Owed: the icache REF-1 exclusivity theorem
   (design/fs-icache.md) and a non-blocking [acquiresleep] variant. *)

  (* [pr] and [uart] are at the TOP, and that is forced by panic().  panic is
     printk + printk + self-jump, so it takes pr.lock and, under it, tx_lock;
     a panic arm reached while holding a lock ABOVE "pr" could not be
     discharged by panic's own contract at all ([SpecPanic]'s
     [locks_below lks "pr"] would be false), and in the real kernel it
     deadlocks.  "Panic fires under nearly every lock, so nothing BELOW the
     two leaves may sit above them" -- said in this file from the start, and
     violated by [itable]/[ftable] until the panic splice needed it: [iget]
     panics HOLDING itable.  Raising the two only WEAKENS every
     [locks_below _ "pr"] obligation and strengthens none: nothing in xv6
     acquires anything while holding uart, and the one lock taken under pr is
     uart itself. *)
  (* THE TWO LEAVES, ABOVE [proc].  kfork takes np->lock from allocproc and
     then, STILL HOLDING IT, runs filedup over the fd table and idup on the
     cwd (kernel/proc.c:287-288), so there are real [proc -> ftable] and
     [proc -> itable] edges.  Both locks can carry a rank above [proc]
     because neither is ever held while anything else is acquired:
     filedup/filealloc are acquire-bump-release, fileclose RELEASES
     ftable.lock before it reaches pipeclose/begin_op/iput, and iget is
     acquire-scan-release. *)

     port's lock after it ([initlock(&u->tx_lock, "uart0"/"uart1")]), so the
     single "uart" is gone from the image and from here.  EQUAL RANKS ARE
     THE POINT: [locks_below {["uart0"]} "uart1"] is FALSE (17 < 17 fails),
     so a hart holding one port's transmit lock may not take the other's --
     which is exactly the discipline, since neither is ever held while
     anything is acquired.  Names at one rank are still distinguished by the
     held SET, so nothing is conflated. *)

(* THE RELEASE CANCELLATION, PROVED ONCE AT AN ABSTRACT NAME.

   A balanced acquire/release pair leaves the held set where it started, and
   every such site needs [({[r]} ∪ lks) ∖ {[r]} = lks].  Prove it here, at an
   opaque [r], and the call sites become [apply locks_add_del] with no set
   reasoning at all.

   THE HAZARD THIS AVOIDS USED TO BE MUCH WORSE.  When the set held RANKS, a
   [set_solver] at a concrete lock met [lock_rank "name"] four times over,
   each an unfolding of [rank_lookup]'s 15-way [String.eqb] chain, and
   set_solver's membership case analysis normalised every one -- measured at
   minutes per site.  Names removed [rank_lookup] from the sets entirely, so
   an inline [set_solver] is now merely string comparisons rather than
   catastrophic.  Keep the discipline anyway: an abstract element is instant,
   and nothing here needs to know which lock it is. *)

(* THE CALL-SITE DISCHARGER.

   Every order premise a caller must supply has one of five shapes, and they
   nest: the held set is built by [∪ {[r]}] on acquire and [∖ {[r]}] on
   release, starting from either [∅] or the caller's own abstract [lks].  So
   the goal is always a tower of those constructors bottoming out in [∅] or in
   a [locks_below lks _] hypothesis already in scope, and the rank comparison
   at each layer is between two closed [lock_rank "..."] calls, which
   [vm_compute] settles.

   Do NOT reach for [set_solver] here.  [lock_rank] is a 15-way [String.eqb]
   chain and [set_solver]'s membership case analysis normalises every
   occurrence of it; see the note on [locks_add_del] above for what that
   costs.  This tactic never unfolds [lock_rank] except under [vm_compute] on
   a goal that is purely two numerals. *)

(* SpecSleep.v -- the public interface of sleep(), stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void sleep(void) {
       struct proc *p = myproc();
       acquire(&p->lock);
       if (p->chan != 0) { p->state = SLEEPING; sched(); }
       release(&p->lock);
     }

   THE CONDITION LOCK IS GONE FROM THIS CONTRACT, and that is the whole
   change.  xv6 used to spell the sleep protocol as one function

       sleep(chan, lk)   /* takes p->lock, releases lk, parks, re-acquires lk */

   whose contract therefore had to name the caller's lock (γk / lka / Rk),
   its resource, and -- once a pipe's cancellable lock wanted the same
   treatment -- a credential [Tk], a dead state [Dk] and three refutations,
   in a whole second [SLEEP_GEN] interface.  The protocol is now split in
   two, and the caller does the lock work itself:

       sleep_prepare(chan);   /* SpecSleepPrepare.v: record the channel   */
       release(lk);           /* the caller's own release                 */
       sleep();               /* park, if no wakeup arrived meanwhile     */
       acquire(lk);           /* the caller's own re-acquire              */

   so everything lock-shaped moved to where it belongs -- the ordinary
   acquire/release contracts, which are already [lock_openable]-generic
   (ACQUIRE_GEN / RELEASE_GEN).  [SLEEP_GEN] is deleted, not ported.

   WHAT IS LEFT IS YIELD'S CONTRACT (SpecYield.v), verbatim but for the
   entry pc: a thread at noff = 0 acquires its own p->lock, parks through
   sched(), and -- once some scheduler dispatches it again -- releases and
   returns.  Read SpecYield.v's header for the reasoning behind each line;
   the two differ only in

     - the state stored before the park (SLEEPING here, RUNNABLE there),
       which no caller can observe, both being [park_ok]; and
     - THE PARK IS CONDITIONAL.  sleep() reads [p->chan] under p->lock and
       parks only if it is non-zero -- wakeup() clears the field, so a
       wakeup that landed between the caller's sleep_prepare and here makes
       sleep a no-op instead of a lost wakeup.  The contract does not case
       on this: [wp_next true pj] already quantifies the continuation over
       the resuming hart, and the no-park arm simply instantiates it at the
       hart it is already on.  (Nothing here promises the wakeup HAPPENS --
       that is liveness; this promises what holds when sleep returns.)

   [eb] IS NOT PINNED, for yield's reason: the trap cone reaches sleep with
   interrupts off, so the acquire inside records intena = 0 and the whole
   call runs at [eb = false].  Hence the trap CSRs and the running claim are
   premises, in their [_ext] form: at [eb = true] sleep's own acquire
   produces them out of the enabled SIE arm and [trap_csrs_ext true = emp];
   at [eb = false] there is no arm to dismantle and the caller brings them.
   sched's crossing demands the set unconditionally, and sepc/scause/stval
   are PER-HART, so a parking function cannot frame them.

   THE CROSSING INDEX IS THE LITERAL [true]: a swtch moves the hart with
   interrupts off, so a park is a hart change that has nothing to do with
   SIE.  Threading [eb] there would claim, at [eb = false], that sleep
   returns on the hart that called it.

   THERE IS NO SECOND INTERFACE.  A caller already holding a spinlock used
   to get [wp_sleep_nested_body], whose park arm walked into sched's
   "sched locks" panic; nothing calls it now, and the comment block below
   the contract says what took its place. *)

  (* THE ORDER PREMISE FOR SLEEP'S OWN ACQUIRE.  The split protocol left
     sleep holding NO caller lock on entry, but sleep still takes p->lock
     itself (proc.c: [acquire(&p->lock)] before the state store), so acquire's
     [locks_below lks s] has to come from here.  BALANCED in
     the held set -- the release at +0x22 gives the rank straight back on both
     arms -- so [lks] is unchanged in the postcondition, and this premise is
     exactly what makes the insert/delete cancel ([locks_below_not_elem]).
     Trivial at [lks = ∅] ([locks_below_empty]), which is every real call site

(* [wp_sleep_nested] entered at noff = [S n], reached sched() at [S (S n)]
   on its park arm, and let sched panic ("sched locks") there.  Its one
   client was the LOCKED branch of a nested [acquiresleep]; iput now takes
   [SpecAcquiresleep.wp_acquiresleep_nb_sconf] instead, which proves it never
   sleeps, so the lemma is deleted together with the
   [SpecSched.wp_sched_locks] it stood on
   (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md).

   [wp_sleep_sconf] above therefore demands [cpu_own 0] unconditionally, and
   it is the only way in.  Sleep's own [acquire(&p->lock)] then puts the
   thread at exactly noff = 1 for the call to sched -- which is what sched's
   check wants, and why that panic is now unreachable rather than permitted. *)

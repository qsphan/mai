(* SpecPlicinit.v -- the public interface of plicinit, stated independently of
   its proof.  [plicinit] (xv6-riscv/kernel/plic.c) sets the PLIC source
   priorities of both UARTs and of the VIRTIO interrupt to 1 (non-zero =
   enabled):

     <plicinit>:
       ...prologue...
       lui  a4,0xc000       a4 = PLIC base (0x0c000000)
       li   a5,1
       sw   a5,40(a4)       *(PLIC + UART0_IRQ*4)   = 1   (source 10 priority)
       sw   a5,48(a4)       *(PLIC + UART1_IRQ*4)   = 1   (source 12 priority)
       sw   a5,4(a4)        *(PLIC + VIRTIO0_IRQ*4) = 1   (source 1  priority)
       ...epilogue...

   The three stores are S-mode 32-bit MMIO writes through the kernel page
   table's PLIC identity mapping.

   STATED OVER THE TIME-0 DEVICE INVARIANT.  Boot-time device init does NOT run
   before the device threads are live -- the PLIC gateway latches whenever an
   irq line is up, so [plic_frag] can never sit raw in a CPU's precondition
   while the system runs.  plicinit is therefore stated over [WpUart.plic_inv]
   and borrows the fragment around each of its three writes.

   NOTHING comes back on the device side, and the contract does not name the
   resulting PLIC state at all: no consumer needs the priorities recorded (a
   device-interrupt proof reads the invariant's [plic_ok], and priority writes
   preserve it), and there is no monotonicity constraint on the PLIC ghost that
   would make a recorded value useful later.

   ProofPlicinit.v proves it over the invariant-opening ACCESSOR-form PLIC
   store leaf [WpPlic.wp_sw_plic_pinv_s_sconf], whose per-write obligation --
   "the write is DEFINED and preserves [plic_ok] at EVERY state the plan
   admits", since a hart cannot know what the others have written -- is
   [PlicPlan.plic_write_prio_ok] for a source-priority write, at each of the
   three source ids.

   Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof file. *)

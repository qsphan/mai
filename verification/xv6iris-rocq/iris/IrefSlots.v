(* IrefSlots.v -- the FIXED SUPPLY that makes [ip->ref++] safe.

   idup increments [ip->ref] with no overflow check, exactly as filedup
   increments [f->ref].  The icache authority needs every count to stay a
   faithful [int] ([IcacheInv.icM_wf]'s second clause) -- that is what makes
   [ref == 0] mean "free" and what [IcacheInv.iref_word_live] turns into
   "ilock's [ref < 1] panic is dead" -- but

     forall n, Z.pos n < 2^31 -> Z.pos (Pos.succ n) < 2^31

   is FALSE at n = 2^31 - 1, so no unconditional increment can re-establish
   the bound and no axiom may assert that it does.  [SpecFiledup.v]'s header
   argues this at length; the argument is repeated here only because the
   conclusion is easy to forget when the counter is a different counter.

   The way out is [FdSlots.v]'s, verbatim in shape: an [authUR natUR] whose
   supply is a REAL, FINITE count of the places a reference can live.  A
   caller that wants to duplicate must hand in one unit, and a unit is
   evidence that the system has somewhere to put the new reference.  The
   accounting -- not arithmetic -- is what bounds the count.

   THE SUPPLY.  Where can an inode reference actually live?

     - each process's [p->cwd]                                    NPROC
     - each ftable entry holding an FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE file     NFILE
     - a per-process allowance for references a syscall holds in
       LOCALS before they reach either home            NPROC * IREFSPARE

   [IREFSPARE] is the honest count of simultaneous in-flight references, not
   a comfortable constant: [create] holds the parent directory and the new
   inode at once, and [link] holds [ip] and [dp] at once -- two.  Four is
   that with room, matching [FdSlots.FDSPARE]'s reasoning.

   Note this supply is NOT [FDSLOTS] and the two must not be shared: an fd
   slot bounds descriptors, an iref slot bounds inode references, and a
   process holds NOFILE of the first but at most one cwd of the second.

   Routing mirrors the fd units exactly: the AUTHORITY lives in the itable
   lock's resource ([IcacheEscrow.itable_res2]) beside the per-slot counts, so
   that a thread holding the lock can weigh the count it is about to bump
   against the supply in one place.                                      *)

   takes two; both run before any file is opened and neither hands anything
   back to the ftable.  If they were carved out of the [NFILE] units the
   table could not start with all [NFILE] slots FREE, and a free slot owns
   one whole unit ([FileInvDefs.file_core]'s untyped arm).  So they are their

   FRACTION ([FileInvDefs.file_core] splits with [q], because filedup hands
   out shares of one file), so the unit backing it has to split the same way
   or it cannot live there at all.

(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT.

    F3's charter is the friendly syscall triple

      <t. fs_rep-fragment> sys_mkdir(path) <t'. post * [t' = tree_insert ...]>

    **THE TREE-DELTA HALF OF THAT CHARTER IS STOPPED, AND THE STOP IS A
    THEOREM ABOUT THE LANDED SEALS, NOT A GAP IN THIS FILE.**  Three
    independent obstructions, each verified against the landed text and
    each recorded at the point of use below:

    (S1) NO SYSCALL SEAL CARRIES A TREE DELTA, AND sys_mkdir's CANNOT BE
         GIVEN ONE CALLER-SIDE.  [SpecSysMkdir.v]:280-304 is the whole
         postcondition: a register file, [proc_priv], the four superblock
         cells, [bslots], the iref
         interval, and [sys_mkdir_ret] (0 or -1).  Nothing inode-shaped,
         nothing byte-shaped, nothing tree-shaped.  ProofSysMkdir.v:60 says
         so itself: *"Nothing inode-shaped survives the call, which is why
         this function's own post mentions none of it."*  The delta is made
         three contracts down (dirlink's record write inside create) and
         nothing on the path relays it: create's own post
         ([SpecCreate.v]:668-692) names ONLY the returned CHILD
         ([create_locked] at [k]/[inum]/[dn]/[bm]) and says nothing whatever
         about the PARENT, which create has already [iunlockput]'d -- while
         the tree delta of a mkdir IS an edge at the parent.  F2's lift
         worked because [SpecDirlookup]'s post spoke about the SAME [data]
         the caller's fragment named; there is no such shared name here.

    (S2) THERE IS NO AMBIENT TREE RESOURCE AT THE SYSCALL BOUNDARY, and R3
         forbids the only thing that would make one.  [FsRep.fnode] needs
         [InodeRegion.dinode_at], which is exclusive and lives inside
         [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] / [ipool_alloc] -- i.e. the ESCROW owns
         every node fragment in the system, and a thread can hold one only
         while it holds that inode's sleeplock (fs-fragments.md 1.4).  A
         syscall-level client holds no lock, so it can supply [fs_rep t]
         only at the EMPTY tree.  The HOCAP shape that would fix this is a
         whole-tree authority whose fragments clients hold -- and R3 kills
         it three times over (20.9(c)/(d)/(e)).  So the AU/HOCAP idiom is
         unavailable at this altitude for the same reason F2's is
         unavailable at a directory node, one level up: it is the lock
         placement, not the spec's shape.

    (S3) RETIRED -- THE PURE-RESOURCE TRIPLE USED NOT TO BE COMPOSABLE FOR
         mkdir.  The iref ledger came back as an INTERVAL
         ([ns - create_slots <= ns' <= ns]), inherited from create's own
         interval, and a friendly client that wanted to call mkdir TWICE
         could not re-establish its own precondition ([create_slots <= ns])
         from that.  This note said the tightening, if ever wanted, was
         create's post rather than sys_mkdir's, and that is exactly where it
         was done: [SpecCreate.v] states its figure EXACTLY now (every
         failure arm returns the ledger whole, every success arm keeps one
         out), so mkdir's and mknod's own posts say [ns' = ns] and both
         wrappers below are composable on the same footing as chdir's.

    ---- SO WHAT DOES LAND -----------------------------------------------

    The OTHER half of F3's charter, item (c): what is HIDDEN.  A syscall
    seal takes 26 pure premises and 31 resources; a client that wants to
    call two syscalls in a row has to re-thread all of it.  This file gives
    the syscall boundary a CALLING CONVENTION -- three bundles and two
    wrappers derived from the landed seals, which do not move:

      [FsReady.fs_geom_ok]  the pure geometry, as ONE PARAMETER-FREE
                  record about the ambient configuration.  Both syscalls
                  take the SAME one; chdir ignores five fields.  (This file
                  used to own a threaded copy called [fs_geom]; rank 1d
                  retired it -- there was nothing left to thread.)
      [FsReady.fs_ready]  the 19 ambient resources, as ONE assertion --
                  **and it is PERSISTENT**, which is the whole point.  A
                  client establishes the file system's world once and every
                  syscall is free of it forever after.  This is the honest
                  content of "the ambient is absorbed": not that the seals
                  hide it, but that all of it is duplicable and none of it
                  is spent.  (This file used to own a wrapper called
                  [fs_world]; rank 1d retired that too.)
      [fs_res]    the 6 consumable resources that go in and come back:
                  [bslots], the four superblock cells and the iref ledger.  THIS is the part a client must account for,
                  and (S3) is exactly a statement about it.

    and, dropped outright because they are [emp] at the [eb = true] both
    seals force: [trap_csrs_ext] and [cpu_claim_ext], in the pre AND the
    post, together with the [eb] parameter itself.  That is F2's bar --
    FEWER premises than the seal, zero axioms added -- met in the one
    dimension where it can be met here.

    WHAT REMAINS IRREDUCIBLE, and is not a defect: the register file ([m],
    [mf], [callee_saved]), the stack budget [K] and the program counter.
    This is a WP over machine code; a friendly layer can bundle the file
    system's world but it cannot make the machine's own state disappear.

    ---- THE ONLY TREE-LEVEL STATEMENT AVAILABLE, AND ITS HONEST SIZE ----

    Framing.  Any assertion a client holds across one of these wrappers
    comes back untouched, [FsRep.fnode] included -- and that IS a locality
    theorem in a CSL ("this syscall cannot have touched a node you own").
    It is not stated as a lemma here because it is the frame rule, true of
    every [iProp] and provable by [iFrame], and because (S2) says a
    syscall-level client cannot in fact hold a node fragment: the escrow
    owns them all.  Recording it as an F3 result would overclaim.  The
    tree-level content of this increment is therefore exactly zero, and the
    stops above are what F3 actually learned.                              *)

    seals take between them, as one record parameterised by the numbers a
    syscall contract used to thread.  Every one of those numbers is a

    for [bitmap_geom_ok]'s four conjuncts.  The two friendly bodies below

  Context `{GEN : GenId}.
  (* the ambient fs names [FsReady.fs_ready] is stated at.  It rides in on
     [fileG] exactly as [icfg] does (see the note on [FileInvDefs.fileG]),
     so there is no binder here and no second instance path. *)

  (* THE AMBIENT IS [FsReady.fs_ready], AND THERE IS NO WRAPPER LEFT.

     [fs_world] IS GONE (rank 1d), and with it [fs_world_all],
     [fs_world_persistent], [fs_world_ready] and [fs_ready_world].  It was
     [fs_ready] plus the EQUATIONS saying a caller's own threaded names were
     the ambient ones -- nineteen of them once, eight after rank 1c (the six
     device/allocator gnames and the bitmap's two numbers).  Those eight
     names are [FsCfg.fscfg] fields now ([fsc_printk], [fsc_kalloc],
     [fsc_uart], [fsc_disk], [fsc_dlock], [fsc_bio], [fsc_bmapstart],
     [fsc_size]), so there is nothing left on either side of an equation:
     what remained of the definition was the parameter-free [fs_ready]
     itself, plus [fs_ready_disk]'s converse at a caller's three ring pages.

     A namer wants one of two things and both are one lemma away:
     [FsReady.fs_ready] as it stands, or -- if it threads its own
     [pd]/[pav]/[pu] -- [FsReady.fs_ready_disk] to unpack the witness and
     [FsReady.disk_geom_agree] to identify the two.  The three ring pages
     are the ONE thing here that is not ambient (FsCfg.v's ruling R1:
     [virtio_disk_init] [kalloc]s them at WP time), which is why they are
     the only reason the converse exists at all.

     [fs_world_all]'s twenty-one-step [iSplit] chain -- written because a
     single [iFrame] over a bundle of definition-valued rows cost 25 s of
     this file -- is [FsReady.fs_ready_all], where it always belonged. *)

  (* THE CONSUMABLES.  What actually crosses the call and comes back: the
     three block slots, the four superblock cells, and the reference ledger
     at [ns].  Everything F3 has to ACCOUNT for is in here, which is why
     (S3) is a statement about this bundle's [ns] and nothing else.  (The
     block bitmap is NOT a consumable: [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv] is a
     persistent conjunct of [fs_ready].)

     THE FOUR GEOMETRY PARAMETERS ARE GONE (rank 1d): the cells are named by
     [fsc_ninodes] / [icfg_ist] / [fsc_size] / [fsc_bmapstart], and [bn] was
     never read by this bundle at all -- it rode along because every other
     row of the calling convention took it. *)

(* ====================================================================== *)

(*  [SpecSysMkdir.wp_sys_mkdir_sconf_body], REPACKAGED.  Five differences
    and no others:

      - the 26 pure premises become SIX: [FsReady.fs_geom_ok], the stack
        budget, the reference allowance, the two process-index facts and
        argstr's trapframe read.  (Fifteen are the image's own geometry and
        live on the ambient record; [eb = true] is discharged below, not
        assumed.)
      - the 19 ambient resources become ONE PERSISTENT [FsReady.fs_ready];
      - the 7 consumables become ONE [fs_res], in the pre and in the post;
      - [eb] is GONE as a parameter, fixed at the [true] the seal's own
        premise forces, and with it [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext]
        vanish from both sides ([emp] at [true], IntrDefs.v:1068, :1737);
      - the post's four pure facts are hoisted in front of the resources,
        so a caller reads the answer before it reads the ledger.

    THE POST'S TREE CONTENT IS EMPTY, and (S1) is why.  What a friendly
    caller learns is: the call returned 0 or -1, its process block is back
    with (only) argstr's page-table growth folded in, and the ledgers moved
    by at most this much.  It learns NOTHING about the file system -- not
    that a directory was made on the 0 arm, not that none was made on the
    -1 arm.  Every syscall in sysfile.c is in the same position; see the
    file header. *)

(* ====================================================================== *)
(*  4.  sys_chdir, FRIENDLY -- AND COMPOSABLE                              *)
(* ====================================================================== *)

(*  The same packaging over [SpecSysChdir.SYSCHDIR], and the
    contrast with mkdir is the point of building both:

    THE LEDGERS CLOSE.  [fs_res] goes in at [ns = 2] and comes back at
    [ns = 2], all four arms.  So a client's precondition is RE-ESTABLISHED
    by the call EXACTLY -- the free pool says nothing at all now that it
    lives in [bitmap_inv] -- and chdir can be called in a loop.  mkdir
    cannot (S3).  The friendly layer's first real distinction between two
    syscalls is a LEDGER fact, not a tree fact.

    THE TREE DELTA IS EMPTY -- BUT NOT FOR THE REASON THE F3 BRIEF EXPECTED.
    chdir was staged as "the NO-DELTA case: t' = t, a pure resolution plus a
    reference swap".  Two corrections, both from the landed text:

      (a) chdir's [iput(p->cwd)] can be the LAST reference to an unlinked
          inode, in which case it truncates and FREES it -- iput's truncate
          arm is the one mover, and since the free pool moved inside
          [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv] it is no longer visible in the seal at all.
          The node store therefore CAN lose a node across a chdir.  What is untouched is
          the reachable tree: a freed inode has [nlink = 0] and no live
          record names it.  "t' = t" is a statement about the LIVE tree
          only, and stating it would need exactly the ambient tree (S2)
          says does not exist.
      (b) the interesting half of chdir's post -- "the new cwd is the node
          [path] resolves to" -- is UNSTATABLE, and R8 is why:
          [SpecNamex.v]:113-124 rules there is no path -> inode functional
          statement, because each dirlookup is atomic under its own lock and
          no stable global tree exists between iterations.  The seal says
          what it can: the process comes back at [upd_cwd V ipv] for an
          EXISTENTIAL [ipv] ([SpecSysChdir.v]:161-166).  That existential is
          not slack -- it is R8, at the syscall boundary.

    So chdir's friendly post is [sys_chdir_post] verbatim.  It is already
    the friendly shape: a two-armed disjunction over the process block, with
    nothing machine-level in it.

    WHERE IT COMES FROM NOW.  [SpecSysChdir.SYSCHDIR] is the syscall's ONE
    contract and its output is [chdir_arms] -- the same two arms with a
    walk cursor and an observation receipt on them.  This packaging hands
    the seal the TRIVIAL bundle ([FsAbsInvFire.fsabs_chdir_pre]: every hop
    says yes, every cursor is [True], the observation returns nothing) and
    forgets the receipts through the one bridge [chdir_arms_landed].  So
    the friendly post below is unchanged, and there is no second proof
    against the code behind it. *)

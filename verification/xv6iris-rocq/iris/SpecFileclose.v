   ==== THE REFERENCE HALF ===============================================

   The simple half, and it is stable: a reference goes in, one [fd_slot]
   comes back, and nothing says which arm ran.  Deliberately so -- the caller
   neither knows nor cares whether it held the last reference.  It is
   entirely [FileInv]'s two close steps:

   * [--f->ref > 0] (file_close_step + file_rest_absorb): the departing
     reference's fraction -- of the content cells, of the payload-names field
     and of the payload itself -- is absorbed back into the invariant's
     leftover.  That the fraction has somewhere to GO is why the authority's
     frac component tracks outstanding fraction rather than being pinned at 1.
   * [--f->ref == 0] (file_close_last_step + file_rest_join): the COUNT
     component forces this closer to hold every share ever handed out
     ([positiveR] has no unit), and the invariant's leftover makes it fraction
     ONE of the whole slot.  That is what licenses the unlocked-looking
     [ff = *f] read and the [f->type = FD_NONE] store, and -- the point of the
     payload link -- it is what puts a WHOLE pipe end, or a whole inode
     reference, in fileclose's hands to give to pipeclose / iput.

   Note the ORDER the C code uses and the model needs: [f->type = FD_NONE] is
   written, and the lock released, BEFORE the payload is spent.  At FD_NONE
   the payload is [emp], so what goes back into the table is the slot with no
   payload while the closer walks away with it.

   The [f->ref < 1] panic arm is dead for the same reason as filedup's: the
   caller's [file_ref] puts slot k in the authority's domain with a positive
   count, and [FileInv.fref_word_spos] turns that into "the sign-extended
   load is signed-positive", which is exactly what [blez] tests.

   ==== THE OTHER HALF: WHAT THE LAST-REFERENCE ARM COSTS ================

   fileclose can free a pipe's page, and it can do disk I/O and SLEEP.  Its
   callers must own the corresponding fabric, and there is no honest way to
   hide that.  What they must own depends on the TYPE of the file, because
   the type is what selects the arm -- so the environment is indexed by it
   ([fileclose_env] / [fileclose_env_out]) rather than being the union:

   * FD_PIPE   -> pipeclose's: the kmem lock and the page count (the page
                  comes back iff this was the pipe's last end), plus
                  [procs_inv] for the wakeup inside it.
   * FD_INODE
     / FD_DEVICE -> begin_op / iput / end_op's: the whole log + buffer-cache
                  + disk fabric, the running-thread bundle, and the parking
                  premise.  The log RESERVATION is not among them: begin_op
                  mints it and end_op retires it, so an operation's budget
                  never crosses fileclose's boundary.
   * FD_NONE   -> nothing at all.

   That last line is not a curiosity: it is what keeps pipealloc's failure
   path cheap.  pipealloc closes files it has just allocated and not yet
   typed ([SpecFilealloc]'s post pins [fc_type Cf = FD_NONE]), so it owns no
   file system and is not asked for one.  sys_pipe closes FD_PIPE files and
   is asked only for the pipe fabric it already has.  Only a caller closing a
   file of UNKNOWN type -- sys_close, kexit -- pays for both, which is the
   truth about closing an arbitrary descriptor.

   The type-indexing also decides the pure side conditions: pipeclose wants
   one more level of lock nesting than fileclose's own acquire, and the FS
   calls want [noff = 0] and the hart-generic parking premise.  Each sits in
   the arm that needs it.

   The ghost names and geometry both arms are indexed by are bundled into one
   [fclose_names], with an [Inhabited] instance, so that a caller which
   cannot reach either arm passes [inhabitant] rather than having to invent a
   [bio_names] it has never heard of.

   WHAT COMES BACK: one [fd_slot], plus the arm's own returns.  The fd slot
   is not a decoration -- it is the return leg of the conservation law that
   makes filedup's unchecked [f->ref++] safe (FdSlots.v /
   design/file-table.md).  [ftable_res] holds one unit per outstanding
   reference, so destroying a reference releases exactly one, whichever arm
   ran: at [n >= 2] the slot's [fd_slots n] shrinks to [fd_slots (n-1)], and
   at [n = 1] the whole entry leaves the authority.  The caller needs it:
   sys_close's descriptor is empty afterwards, and an empty
   [ProcInv.ofile_slot] owns its unit itself. *)

     kexit walks the whole fd table, so its loop has to carry the environment
     round.  Everything in both bundles except the four consumables and the
     page count is persistent, so the round trip is a persistent wand: hand
     the bundle over, and rebuild it from what comes back.  The page count
     comes back CHANGED -- pipeclose frees the page only if it closed the
     pipe's last end -- which is why the pipe bundle is rebuilt under an
     existential, and hence why [on] is a parameter and not a field.

     If either of these ever stops compiling, a conjunct of the environment
     has stopped being persistent and must be routed back through the

     the [fcontent] existentially, and that knowledge is going to arrive as
     per-[ofile] ghost state in [struct proc] rather than off the ftable.  So
     it carries BOTH bundles, hands over whichever the environment asks for,
     and keeps the other untouched.  This is that move, proved once: the
     environment out, and a wand that puts both bundles back together from
     whatever came back.

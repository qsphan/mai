(* [NSTD] is how many descriptors at the bottom of the table are tracked
   TOTALLY -- open or closed -- rather than only when open.  It is NOT a
   kernel constant: nothing in xv6 mentions it, no kernel proof may read
   it, and that is why it lives here rather than beside [NOFILE].  It is
   the width of the window a USER program has to know the exact state of
   in order to predict where the next [fdalloc] lands.

   THREE, because that is where the code's dependence stops.  init opens
   the console as fd 0 and dups it to 1 and 2; sh's REDIR is [close(0 or
   1); open(...)] and each half of its PIPE is [close(0 or 1); dup(pipe
   end)].  No xv6 program closes a descriptor of 3 or above and then
   depends on the NUMBER the next allocation returns.  If one ever does,
   raise this constant: nothing but the width of a program's ledger
   ([ustd]) changes. *)

     case analysis on the LEDGER, not on the kernel's answer -- which is the

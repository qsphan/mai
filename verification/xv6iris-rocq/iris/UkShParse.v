     constructors do not TEST [malloc]: [execcmd] goes straight into
     [memset(cmd, 0, 168)], so a NULL return is a FAULT in the shell rather
     than a branch, and nothing the caller could be handed would let it
     continue.  What it is handed on that arm is the run at the return
     address with [a0 = 0] and NOTHING else -- no bytes, no moved break --
     which is exactly enough to walk into [memset]'s first store and be
     KILLED there ([UkSh.wp_ksh_memset_null]).  So the arm is usable by the
     very code it is for after all, and the assumption is gone.  (Since
     upstream d66e41c the constructors call [cmdalloc], which TESTS the
     answer and calls [panic] on this arm: [UkShCmdalloc.wp_kshp_cmdalloc].)
     The two arms are ONE continuation at a disjunction, which is the shape
     the allocator's own leaf hands out ([UkShMalloc.wp_kshm_malloc_first]). *)

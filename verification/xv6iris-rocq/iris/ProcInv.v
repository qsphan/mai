(* ProcInv.v -- the [struct proc] resources beyond the five fields the
   scheduler needed: the PRIVATE field block a running process owns without
   holding any lock, the open-file-descriptor array (each non-null slot
   holding a real [FileInv.file_ref]), and the DORMANT shape that block
   collapses to when nobody is running the process.

   The analysis this realises is in claude-notes/design/proc-struct.md; the
   short version:

   * [state]/[chan]/[killed]/[xstate] are lock-protected and mutable, so all
     four cells live unconditionally in the proc lock's resource (SchedCtx.v).
   * [pid] is lock-protected but immutable-while-allocated, and is read BOTH
     by other cores under p->lock (kill's scan) and unlocked by the owning
     process (sys_getpid, acquiresleep).  That is FileInv's discipline 2, and
     it takes the same answer: a points-to FRACTION, half resident in the lock
     resource, half travelling with the runner.  Agreement between the halves
     is [ctx_word4_pointsto_agree] -- no ghost algebra.
   * [sz]/[pagetable]/[trapframe]/[ofile]/[cwd]/[name] are written by the
     running process with NO lock held (sys_sbrk's [myproc()->sz += n],
     sys_chdir, fdalloc, exec).  So the invariant can retain no fraction of
     them: it must give the whole block away while the process is live and
     take it back when it is not.  [proc_priv] is the block; [proc_dormant]
     is what the invariant holds instead.
   * [kstack] is written once by procinit and never again: persistent.

   [proc_priv] is the resource that rides alongside [cur_proc p]
   (ProcGeom.v).  myproc() returns the [p] of [cur_proc p]; [proc_priv] is
   what makes [myproc()->pid] / [->sz] / [->cwd] / [->ofile[fd]] readable
   with no lock in hand.

   The lock invariant that consumes [proc_dormant] / [inv_dormant] lives in
   SchedCtx.v, since it also mentions [proc_ctx]: [proc_pub] (the
   always-resident killed/xstate/pid-half row) + [proc_slots] (the two flat
   guards) + [proc_lock_res].  This file stays below it and mentions neither.

   Also here: [tf_page], the whole trapframe PAGE that [p_trapframe]'s
   pointer names -- all 36 [struct trapframe] words with their values plus
   the 3808-byte tail.  It is here rather than in ProcPtOwn because the
   syscall path needs the VALUE of [tf->aN], which a contents-existential
   page cannot supply. *)

     instance the whole process layer already shares.  Nothing downstream
     grows a binder for the file system. *)

  (* A LIVE fd slot: the cell, and -- when non-null -- an actual reference on
     the [struct file] it points at.  [file_ref] is deliberately neither
     persistent nor duplicable: duplicating an fd IS filedup, which must bump
     the physical count under ftable.lock.  Naming the file by its ftable slot
     index [k] with [v = fnode k] is what bridges FileInv's index-keyed
     algebra to the pointer actually stored in memory. *)
  (* Either way the slot owns ONE unit of fd-slot capability (FdSlots.v),
     and the disjunction is where it currently is: an EMPTY descriptor holds
     the unit itself; a descriptor naming a file has given it away, and the
     ftable holds it against that file's count.  That conservation is what
     bounds any file's [ref] by FDSLOTS, hence what makes filedup's unchecked
     [f->ref++] safe -- so this predicate is the proc-side end of the law
     whose file-side end is [FileInv.fslot]. *)
  (* [γd] IS THE PROCESS'S OWN fd-state ghost ([ProcDefs.pv_fdg] of its
     private block), and this is where the ghost is PINNED TO THE MACHINE:
     a null cell is a CLOSED descriptor, and a cell naming a file is an OPEN
     descriptor whose state is THE REFERENCE'S OWN STATE INDEX -- the [st] of
     [file_ref γf k q st], not a function applied to it.  So the ghost
     cannot drift: [st] occurs twice in one predicate, and no step can move
     one occurrence without the other.  See FdSlots.v's header for the
     two-halves shape and why the name is per-INCARNATION, and
     [FileInvDefs.file_ref] for why the reference is what carries the state
     (short version: the inode NUMBER is not a [struct file] field, so
     [fcontent] cannot supply it).
       [st <> FdClosed] on the file disjunct is the statement that a
     descriptor never names an UNTYPED file -- filealloc's fresh file gets
     [FdClosed] ([FileInv.file_alloc_step]) and reaches a descriptor only
     after sys_open or pipealloc has retyped it.  It has to be said HERE,
     because it is what makes "the cell is non-null" and "the ghost says
     open" the same fact.
       ONLY THE AUTHORITY IS HERE.  The matching fragments live in
     [FdSlots.fd_frags], a bundle that travels BESIDE the block
     ([UsertrapRes.ut_own]); read that predicate's header for why.  The
     consequence is the point of the split: this predicate alone can no

  (* THE DEFICIT: descriptors whose payload is on loan.                   *)
  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* A syscall that must hold one of its OWN descriptors' references in a
     register cannot leave the array satisfying [proc_ofiles]: the cell still
     names the file, so [ofile_slot]'s file disjunct demands a reference that
     is not there.  sys_dup is the case that forces it -- [fdalloc] stores the
     pointer before [filedup] bumps the count, and [filedup] wants the SOURCE
     descriptor's reference in hand to split, so two descriptors are payloadless
     at once.  Crucially [fdalloc] itself needs the array, so the reference
     cannot merely be borrowed with [proc_ofiles_ofile] across the call: that
     accessor's wand demands a whole [ofile_slot] back first.
       [proc_ofiles_owe γf γd pa fs D] is the array with the payloads of [D]
     missing -- each such descriptor contributes only its cell.

     WHY THE NON-NULL CLAUSE.  A lent descriptor's cell is never null (one only
     lends a descriptor that names a file), and saying so HERE is what lets
     fdalloc's install arm conclude [fd ∉ D] from "the cell I found is null":
     fdalloc is generic in [D] and never learns it, so without this it could
     not tell a free descriptor from a lent one, and could install a second
     reference over a loan.

     THE AUTHORITY LEAVES WITH THE REFERENCE, so a lent descriptor carries
     no ghost at all.  That is what makes the fragment bundle needed by
     exactly the operations that RETYPE a descriptor and by no others:
     read / write / fstat lend a descriptor and give the SAME file back, so
     the authority they took out at the file's [st] is the one they return
     and nothing has to move; open / pipe / dup / close / fork install a
     DIFFERENT state, and only they have to reach into the bundle
     ([FdSlots.fd_st_move]).  An arm that parked the authority here instead
     would have to update on the way out even when nothing changed, which
     would put the bundle in every descriptor-touching contract and say
     something false about read.

     WHY NOT A THIRD [ofile_slot] DISJUNCT.  Because only the holder of the
     block sees [D].  A "maybe on loan" case inside [ofile_slot] would have to
     be REFUTED by every consumer of a non-null descriptor (argfd's callers,
     sys_close), and none of them can do that from [v <> 0] alone.  See

  (* STATED AT THE PHYSICAL TIER, so uservec/userret's OWN low-level

     (allocproc/freeproc, above) goes through the SAME whole-page
     [kmap_static_claims] every other kalloc'd page already needs, not a
     per-word one -- and the handful of kernel-side identity-map readers
     that still want the mem tier pay it per-word, via
     [tf_page_word_mem]/[tf_page_word_upd_mem] just above, using
     [pt_node_claim_from_static]'s own persistent claim (no LEAF-only
     [hw_config] opening needed at the read site: [pt_node_claim] is
     obtained ONCE, from the same boot-time bundle, and threaded in). *)

  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* THE resource that rides alongside [cur_proc p].                      *)
  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* [cwd]: p->cwd holds ONE WHOLE inode reference -- [IcacheHeld.inode_held],
     the same predicate the last [fileclose] of an FD_INODE file recovers
     from its payload and hands to iput.  (C6b: this was [emp] while there
     was no inode model; design/proc-struct.md's "holes to be honest about"
     records the hole and design/fs-icache.md §3 the route out of it.)

     THERE IS NO [v = zero_reg] ARM, AND THAT IS THE POINT.  A null
     [p->cwd] is not a state this predicate describes -- it is a state in
     which the block does not hold this conjunct at all, which is what
     [proc_priv_nocwd] is for.  The two mechanisms are alternatives, not
     partners: with a null arm, [proc_priv] no longer implies
     [pv_cwd V <> 0], and every contract that reaches [iput(p->cwd)] --
     kexit, kfork, and their syscall wrappers -- has to carry that fact as
     a PREMISE its own callers must then supply.  Without one it is a
     PROJECTION of the block ([proc_priv_cwd_nonzero]), free at every
     altitude, and the construction window (allocproc's return, kfork's
     150 bytes before the [sd a0,336(s4)], kexit's tail after [iput]) is
     covered by the deficit block instead.

     That matters beyond tidiness because of WHERE the fact would have to
     travel: [SchedCtx.proc_slots_recast] moves SLEEPING -> RUNNABLE ->
     RUNNING for free, and stays free only because [proc_slots] mentions
     neither [proc_ctx]'s nor [proc_dormant]'s contents.  A [cwd <> 0]
     conjunct anywhere near it would break exactly that; as a projection it
     rides inside the Löb'd obligation and no recast ever looks at it. *)
  (* AT ITS INUM (lane C1): the block ties the pointer to [pv_cwi], the
     inum the process's cwd names, and this is the tie --

  (* [p->sz] NEVER EXCEEDS MAXVA.  This is a real invariant of a live
     process -- exec and growproc are the only writers and both bound the
     size -- and it belongs HERE rather than in each consumer's precondition:
     vmfault / copyin / copyout sit BELOW the [proc_priv] altitude (they take
     the bare [p_sz] cell, not the block) and must keep taking it as a
     premise, but every caller AT this altitude holds nothing but
     [proc_priv], so a premise there would be one no caller could discharge.
     [proc_priv_sz_bound] is how such a caller pays it. *)
  (* [p->sz] BOUNDS THE MAP, and both facts are conjuncts of the block.
     The size never exceeds TRAPFRAME ([uvm_maxsz]) -- growproc's own
     [sz + n > TRAPFRAME] check and exec's are the only things that raise it
     -- and NOTHING IS MAPPED AT OR ABOVE IT ([ProcPtOwn.um_below]).  The
     second is what growproc pays uvmalloc's freshness premise out of: the
     run [PGROUNDUP(sz) .. sz+n) is fresh in [ud_um] exactly because the
     invariant says so, and no caller of growproc could have supplied it.
     Neither can be a premise of a consumer for the reason in the header:
     everything at this altitude holds nothing but [proc_priv].  It is why
     copyin / copyout hand back [uptd_ext_sz], not [uptd_ext] -- see
     [proc_priv_copy]. *)
  (* THE BLOCK MINUS THE FD TABLE.  Split out because the fd table is the one
     component a syscall may have to hold in a NON-[proc_ofiles] state (a
     payload on loan, see [proc_ofiles_owe] above) while still handing the rest
     of the block to a callee.  A deficit block is not [proc_priv ∗ anything] --
     the cell of a lent descriptor names a file and [ofile_slot] then demands
     the missing reference, so there is no frame lemma to be had -- and making
     every [proc_priv]-taking spec generic in the deficit set would be the
     wrong shape.  Splitting HERE costs nothing instead: the callees that must
     be callable across a loan (piperead / pipewrite / fileread / filewrite /
     filestat) never touch the descriptor array at all, so they take
     [proc_priv_core] and the caller keeps its own fd-table term.  [fdalloc] is
     the single exception, and it takes the deficit set explicitly.

     No [γf]: the core is exactly the part with no file-layer content.

     ---- THE LAST CONJUNCT IS [FirstTok.first_tok] ---------------------
     proc.c's [static int first], as a resource the PROCESS carries: either
     the exclusive boot arm (the pinned [first_addr ↦₄ 1] cell, main's
     sixteen persistent rows, the sealed page count and fsinit's whole
     premise pile) or the persistent steady arm ([first_addr ↦₄□ 0] beside
     [FsReady.fs_ready]).  It lives HERE, in the block, because forkret --
     the branch's only reader -- runs on a context a park saved, and the
     block is the only thing a parked process still owns.  "At most one
     process ever runs the boot arm" is then a theorem about ownership: the
     two arms are incompatible at one address, so no second block can hold
     the exclusive one.

     WHY IT IS NOT IN [proc_priv_nocwd].  allocproc does not return a
     process in a RUNNABLE or SLEEPING state -- kfork holds its result for
     150 bytes before the [sd a0,336(s4)] that installs the cwd -- so a
     contract at the deficit block must not have to PRODUCE a token.  The
     deficit block is exactly the pre-park shape, and the token joins at the
     same seam the working directory does ([proc_priv_split_cwd] is
     three-way for that reason). *)
  (* THE MEMORY CONJUNCT IS THE LAZY sz-REGION VIEW -- see
     [ProcDefs.proc_priv_bare]'s note for why (vmfault, and hence copyin
     and every fault-only path, preserves it). *)
  (* ---- THE LAST CONJUNCT IS THIS INCARNATION'S GENERATION -------------
     [ChildTok]'s KERNEL QUARTER and, beside it, the process's own
     persistent knowledge of the payload its exit owes.  The pair is the
     process's identity as a wait()-side resource holder:

       [gen_kq] is LINEAR and there is exactly one, which is what makes
       "the payload is paid once" a theorem: kexit spends it on the ZOMBIE
       escrow ([ChildTok.exit_tok], parked in [ProcDefs.proc_dormant]) and
       no second block can hold another.
       [my_pay] is PERSISTENT and is what the process's own U-mode slot is
       built against ([UkRun.ukn_pay]) -- the exec bridge hands it to the
       new image's slot ([SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre]), and the exit deposit
       is stated at it.

     THE PAYLOAD IS EXISTENTIAL HERE.  A block does not get to say what its
     process owes: the parent chose it at fork ([ChildTok.gen_set]), and
     what a holder of the block may do with it is exactly what agreement
     allows.  allocproc mints the pair at the trivial payload
     ([ChildTok.gen_alloc] then [gen_split]); kfork re-chooses it before the
     split; exec preserves it ([KexecDefs.KexecOkQ] keeps [pv_gen]). *)

  (* ---- THE CONSTRUCTION WINDOW -------------------------------------
     [cwd_ref] has no null arm, so a process whose [p->cwd] is still 0 does
     not satisfy [proc_priv] -- and allocproc returns exactly such a
     process, which kfork then holds for 150 bytes before its
     [sd a0,336(s4)].  So the reference SPLITS OFF, the same move S4c made
     for the fd table: a block with a deficit is not [proc_priv ∗ anything],
     so split at the component the callee does not touch.

     Note this splits only the REFERENCE, not the [p_cwd] CELL: the cell
     stays inside [proc_fields], so [proc_dormant], [SpecFreeproc] and every
     other consumer of [proc_fields] is untouched.  A holder of the deficit
     block still owns the cell and writes it with
     [proc_priv_nocwd_cwd]. *)
  (* THE GENERATION'S PAIR IS NOT HERE, and that is what makes the deficit
     block the PRE-FORK shape.  allocproc returns the incarnation's
     ownership WHOLE and beside the block ([SpecAllocproc]'s post,
     [ChildTok.gen_own] at [DfracOwn 1] and the trivial payload) precisely
     so that the forking parent can still CHOOSE the payload
     ([ChildTok.gen_set]) -- which is possible only at full ownership.  The
     split into the kernel's quarter and the persistent [my_pay] happens at
     the same store the working directory and the token join at
     ([proc_priv_split_cwd] is six-way for that reason), which is where
     the block becomes [proc_priv]. *)

  (* ---- THE ADDRESS-SPACE SPLIT --------------------------------------
     THE BLOCK MINUS THE PAGE TABLE.  Split out for the reason the fd
     table and the cwd reference above were, one tier further out: the
     one window in which a live process's block is NOT complete is user
     execution, where the address space is INSTALLED (satp points at it,
     [UserPtTree.user_pt_inv] owns it) rather than parked.  A kernel-side
     residue that must survive that window therefore cannot contain
     [proc_pt] -- holding both is [ptree_own 2 (DfracOwn 1)] and the user
     pages claimed TWICE, i.e. an unsatisfiable precondition and a vacuous
     lemma, which is exactly the trap the uservec boundary fell into (see
     claude-notes/projects/uservec.md).

     The two [struct proc] CELLS stay: [p->pagetable] / [p->trapframe] are
     ordinary kernel words that merely NAME the table, and the kernel owns
     them straight through user execution.  So does the trapframe page --
     [tf_page] is at the tier-neutral physical tier and user mode cannot
     reach it (its leaf has U = 0), so it is residue, not address space.

  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* WHY THERE ARE TWO FAMILIES, AND WHY IT IS NOT A CROSS-PRODUCT.  A
     [file.c] function that copies to or from user memory needs the process
     block AND a descriptor's [file_ref] -- and those cannot be held at once,
     because the only source for the reference is [proc_ofiles], which
     [proc_priv_ofile] / [proc_priv_lend] BORROW out of the block
     (design/file-table.md, "A FUNCTION THAT TAKES A DESCRIPTOR'S REFERENCE
     MUST NOT TAKE [proc_priv]").  So fileread / filewrite / filestat and
     their whole cone are stated over [proc_priv_core], and the syscall above
     them splits once ([proc_priv_lend]), keeps the fd table, and hands the
     core down.

     None of those callees ever touches the descriptor array -- measured, and
     that is what makes the move free -- so each of these is exactly its
     [proc_priv] twin with the [proc_ofiles] conjunct absent.  The twin at the
     block's altitude stays: every consumer that does NOT hold a reference
     (growproc, kexit, kfork, the trapframe writers) is stated there and
     should not be made to split.

     They are stated rather than derived from the block versions for the
     obvious reason: [proc_priv_core] cannot conjure a [proc_ofiles]. *)

  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* THE ADDRESS-SPACE SWAP -- exec, and only exec.                       *)
  (* =================================================================== *)
  (* [proc_priv_addrspace] above is the GROW/SHRINK bridge: the table OBJECT
     stays put and only its map moves, which is why it pins [ud_root] and
     demands the same [p->pagetable] value back.  kexec REPLACES the object:
     it builds a second table with proc_pagetable, loads the image into that,
     and only at the commit block stores its root into [p->pagetable].  So no
     premise about [ud_root] can be paid, and the cell comes back holding a
     DIFFERENT page.
       [ud_tfp] is still pinned, and that is not an artifact of the proof.
     The trapframe PAGE genuinely does not move across an exec: proc_pagetable
     maps whatever [p->trapframe] already holds, and [tf_page] -- the page's
     BYTES -- is outside [proc_pt] entirely, so it survives the old table's
     proc_freepagetable and is simply re-attached to the new descriptor.  The
     trapframe WORDS do move (epc / sp / a1), which is what [ws'] is for.
       Three things this lends that [proc_priv_addrspace] does not, each
     because kexec needs it while the block is open: the [p->trapframe] CELL
     (proc_pagetable reads it), [tf_page] (the commit block writes three of
     its words), and the two pure conjuncts (proc_freepagetable's premises are
     exactly those, AT THE OLD SIZE AND DESCRIPTOR, and the old size is gone
     from the cell by the time the free happens -- the C saves it in [oldsz]

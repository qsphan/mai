(* FsStateEra.v -- THE IN-ERA INODE BUNDLE, and the dictionary that turns
   the kernel's in-memory block model into an [FsStateInode.fs_node].

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-state.md sections 2 and 4;
   stage 2b-inode-2 of claude-notes/projects/durable-disk.md.

   ---- WHAT THE BUNDLE IS ----------------------------------------------

   Under ruling (i) of 2b-inode-1 a checked-out inode does NOT carry its
   record's 64 bytes: those park REGION-side, because [ialloc]'s and
   [ireclaim]'s free-slot scans read OTHER slots' bytes out of a shared
   inode block while holding no per-slot resource.  What travels instead is
   [InodeRegion.dinode_at], the holder's EXCLUSIVE record proxy -- agreement
   pins the value, exclusivity confers the write permission, and the write
   itself is an AU that borrows the region's run for the linearization
   point.  So the in-era bundle is

     inode_owned_era gfs gi inum n :=
         dinode_at gi inum (fn_rec n)                    (* the proxy      *)
       * inode_dat G n                                   (* the DATA LEG   *)
       * top_frag G (bv_unsigned inum) n                 (* the era's top  *)
       * |{ inode_local (bv_unsigned inum) n }|

   -- i.e. [FsStateInode.inode_owned] with [rec_owned] replaced by the
   proxy and with the LINK ghosts left out.  THE DATA LEG IS NOT THIS
   FILE'S OWN PREDICATE: [FsStateInode.inode_dat] is [inode_phi] minus its
   record, and a checked-out inode holds exactly that, at a share
   ([inode_dat_q]).  Until durable-disk EV stage 2 this file carried a twin
   of it called [inode_bytes_era]; there is no such thing any more, and
   nothing about the era's bytes needs saying twice.  The links are NOT part of this
   bundle and are not going to be: since durable-disk 2b-inode-4 a
   directory's TOKENS ride beside it in the escrow payload
   ([FsStateInode.ent_toks], see the section at the end of this file) and
   the per-inum AUTHORITY lives with the record in the inode region.

   [fn_rec n] IS the value of [dinode_at] and [n] IS the value of the top
   fragment: the bundle names each once, so both ties are maintained BY
   CONSTRUCTION and neither is ever a clause.  A record write therefore
   moves all three together, which is what [inode_owned_era_retag] does.

   ---- THE DICTIONARY ---------------------------------------------------

   [InodeInv]'s pure block model ([blkmap], [blkmap_get], [bm_cells],
   [bm_covers], [blk_holes_zero], [inode_sized]) is KEPT as the bridge --
   the worklist's KEEP verdict -- because readi/writei/bmap/itrunc are
   stated over it and a wholesale restatement of those four is out of
   scope.  So the two models are related here, in BOTH directions:

     era_node dn bm data : fs_node        (blkmap + total data -> node)
     bm_of  n           : blkmap         (node -> blkmap)

   with [era_node (fn_rec n) (bm_of n) (fn_data n) = n] under
   [inode_local] ([era_node_bm_of]).  The direction a payload FLIP uses is
   [bm_of]: a payload whose [data] is EXISTENTIALLY bound (which is exactly
   what [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] has) picks the node first and reads the
   old model off it, so no extensionality between two [data] functions is
   ever needed.

   ---- WHAT [inode_local] DOES NOT GIVE BACK ----------------------------

   [InodeLock.inode_ok] is [blkmap_wf] + four record facts + the two data
   facts.  Of [blkmap_wf]'s five conjuncts, three are [inode_local]
   ([bmw_of_local]); the other two are NOT, by design (fs-state.md
   section 0):

     - INJECTIVITY is the [*].  [inode_owned_era_slot_inj] reads it off the
       block big-op through [FsStateDefs.blk_owned_ne], with no clause.
     - COVERAGE ([b in cov], [b not in log_region_set]) is a consequence of
       OWNING the run, produced by [FsBlocks.fsblock_home_open] against the
       log's byte invariant -- a fupd at [logN], not a pure fact.
       [inode_owned_era_home] is that reading for one slot.

   Two further facts a caller of [inode_ok] has that [inode_local] does NOT
   imply, recorded here because they are what any flip of a payload must
   supply from elsewhere:

     - [bv_unsigned (di_type dn) <> 0] -- "this inode is allocated".  It is
       the checked-out payload's own fact and stays a payload conjunct.
     - [inl_type] (the type is one of 0 / T_DIR / T_FILE / T_DEVICE) is
       STRONGER than [inode_ok]'s type conjunct, which only says "nonzero".
       Nothing in the in-memory chain produces the enumeration today: the
       image gives it ([FsImg.fio_type]) and [ialloc] re-establishes it,
       but no region or icache clause carries it in between.  Likewise
       [inl_dir_size] ("16 divides a directory's size") and the two dots
       clauses have no [inode_ok] counterpart -- the tree carries the
       latter two as [DirView.dir_dots_ix] / [FsTree.dir_uniq], which ARE
       payload conjuncts.  So [inode_local_of_ok] takes exactly the four
       facts [inode_ok] lacks, and closing the [inl_type] one is a ruling
       for the orchestrator. *)

   the era bundle's is the NODE, so a read-lock withdrawal that leaves the
   residue in the escrow under an existential [(dn', bm', data')] and hands
   the holder a quarter at [era_node dn bm data] can only re-form the payload
   if the two pairs agree.  They do, and [data] plays no part: a node pins the
   record outright, [inode_ok] turns the record's [di_addrs] into the blkmap's
   cells on BOTH sides, and the node's own [fn_ent] pins the indirect entries.

   [data] is NOT determined -- two data functions differing above [MAXFILE],
   or at an unallocated slot, give the same node -- which is exactly why the
   join re-forms the payload at the ARM's [data] (existentially bound there)
   and never has to compare the two. *)

     exactly [inode_dat_q (fs_gamma_L γfs) (DfracOwn (1/4)) n] and the

  (* ==================================================================== *)

  (*  A holder owns the TOKENS its own directory records file against other
      inums -- [FsStateInode.ent_toks] at the payload's own node -- and it
      does NOT own the per-inum AUTHORITY.  That stays with the RECORD, i.e.
      in the inode region ([InodeRegion.ireg_slot], tied to [di_nlink] of
      the slot's own record), which is 2b-inode-1's ruling (i) applied to
      the ghost that mirrors a record FIELD.  Two things force it and
      neither is a placement preference:

      - [IgetLic]'s licence (a) is "a directory record names this inum and
        PAYS for it".  Reading allocatedness off it is the RA's law
        ([FsStateLink.link_auth_toks_le]) at the TARGET's authority, and the
        target is an inode the presenter does not hold.  With the authority
        in the target's own payload nothing in the tree can reach it, and
        the licence -- hence [SpecIget]'s premise -- has no discharge.
        Region-side, the reading is one [inv_acc] of [iregN], which is
        exactly where the pure clause (L1) it replaces was read.
      - Every move of a count is a FLUSH ([iupdate]), which already opens
        the region to write the record; [link_mint]/[link_return] are basic
        updates, so they compose into that AU at no mask cost.

      The tokens are [ent_toks] verbatim; this section only carries the two
      congruences a payload needs, since a payload binds its [data]
      existentially and re-parks at a different one. *)

      ONE of them: the entry map gains [s |-> inum] and nothing else.  The
      two lemmas below are the two arms [SpecDirlink]'s [tot = 0 \/ tot =
      16] offers, stated over the premises the walk actually holds (the
      record delta, the size max and the range clause), so that a call site
      is one [iDestruct] and no view equation is ever restated there.

      The record-count arithmetic is [DirView.dir_uniq_dirlink]'s verbatim:
      at [k0 < nrec] the write reuses a free record and the count is
      unmoved; at [k0 = nrec] it appends and the count grows by exactly
      one, which is what makes the "records the count grew over are dead"
      clause of [FsTree.dir_insert_at] vacuous. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
  (*  THE BORROW AT A MATCHED RECORD -- where licence (a) comes from      *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (*  [ProofDirlookup]'s found arm holds the home directory's tokens and
      needs the ONE unit at the record the scan stopped on.  Peel it with
      a [big_sepM_lookup_acc] at the name the scan matched --
      [FsTree.dir_view_lookup] says the map's value at a WINNING record's
      name is that record's inum -- and hand back the wand that re-seals.
      Nothing is spent: [iget] returns the licence at the same [l].

      The [dir_inum <> self] premise is the SELF exemption: at a self
      record there IS no unit ([ent_tokenless]), and the caller uses
      licence (c) instead.  That case split is not an accident of the
      proof -- it is the (a)-vs-(c) boundary, drawn where xv6 draws it.
      NOTHING IS OWED ABOUT THE NAME.  [ent_tokenless] exempts a dot name
      only at an ORPHAN, and this borrow already runs under a LIVE home
      ([di_nlink <> 0], which the found arm holds out of
      [SpecDirlookup.dl_lic_live]) -- which is exactly why that guard is
      on the definition. *)
  (* ---- ONE ENTRY'S PAIR, ON LOAN (durable-disk G3) ------------------ *)

  (*  S7-unlink's dir arm has to READ two of its own entries' units before
      it may spend anything: [dp]'s record for [ip] (whose counting token
      refutes [ip = root], (D1) step 2) and [ip]'s own [".."] (whose
      REGISTER unit is what [InodeRegion]'s (U2) reads (D2) off).  Both
      readings come before the zeroing, so both units go out on loan and
      come straight back.

      [ent_toks_borrow] above is the same split at the COUNTING token
      alone, kept as it is because licence (a)'s caller never wants the
      register unit; this one lends the PAIR, and is keyed by the record
      INDEX rather than by a [dir_first] hit, which is the form a walk
      that already knows its record's index and liveness has. *)
  (* THE ["."] RECORD'S FRAGMENT, borrowed and handed straight back
     (durable-disk G5, (D1)'s engine).  A live directory's own ["."] names
     its home and STILL owes a fragment -- that is the [+1] in
     [FsStateInode.fn_mult] -- and the fragment's value PINS the home's
     [".."] target ([FsStateInode.ent_ty_ok]'s dot arm).  rmdir reads it
     against the parent's own name record for the same inum. *)

(* SEALED FOR THE [iFrame]-UP-TO-DELTA RULE (durable-notes).  Both are
   separating conjunctions over a [big_sepM] of block runs and an
   [ind_owned_q] whose body is a [decide] on a term no resolution can reduce,
   so an unsealed one turns every [Timeless] / [Frame] search that meets it
   into a backtracking walk of the whole payload -- measured at over
   NINETEEN MINUTES on one [apply _] for [IcacheEscrow.ic_rd_arm], the read
   arm's residue, with no error and no output.  The declared instances and
   [rewrite /inode_owned_era_q] still work.

   THE DATA LEG ITSELF is sealed one level down, at its home:
   [FsStateInode]'s [inode_dat_q]/[inode_dat] carry that seal now, which is
   why the third name this list used to hold ([inode_bytes_era], a twin of
   [inode_dat_q] at the logged view) could go away entirely (durable-disk
   EV stage 2).

   The UNSUFFIXED [inode_owned_era] is deliberately not in this list: it is
   the [DfracOwn 1] reading forty payload sites already frame through --
   and its data leg is now ONE sealed atom rather than two conjuncts, which
   is a strictly cheaper thing for those sites to frame. *)

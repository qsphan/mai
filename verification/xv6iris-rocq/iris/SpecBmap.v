   THE CONTRACT (claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md, "bmap's contract").
   One existential map bm' and the returned block, in two arms:

   - a0 = 0 -- allocation failed, and [blkmap_get bm' bn = 0].  Note that
     bm' is NOT claimed equal to bm: the indirect-path failure can already
     have allocated and installed the INDIRECT block before failing on the
     data block, so "the map is unchanged" would simply be false there.
     What both arms do promise is that bm' agrees with bm at every file
     index except possibly bn.
   - a0 = r <> 0 -- [blkmap_get bm' bn = r].

   Both arms return [inode_map γfs ip bm'] and [blkmap_wf cov logstart bm'].
   The fresh data block is DEPOSITED, not returned: bmap takes the
   caller's [inode_blocks] bundle and gives it back with the freshly
   allocated block in it, so nothing here is asymmetric between the two
   arms (design doc, "Why the fresh block is deposited, not returned").
   The bundles are ALSO what carry each block's EXCLUSIVE byte run, and
   those are what re-establishes [blkmap_wf]'s injectivity when balloc's
   block is installed ([FsBlocks.fsblock_ne]: two owners of one block's
   bytes is [False]).

   THE BUDGET IS SPEND-AT-MOST, not spend-exactly: [log_op γ n] in with
   (5 <= n), and [log_op γ n'] out with (n - 5 <= n' <= n).  bmap cannot
   promise to have spent five, because it has no way to BURN a surplus --
   [log_op] moves only through the ledger authority inside log.lock, which
   bmap never takes -- and on the direct-hit path it does no balloc and no
   log_write at all.  See the clause itself for why the premise is a lower
   bound on the caller's counter rather than a (5 + u) shape.

   THE PANIC ARM IS DEAD.  bmap's [panic("bmap: out of range")] at +0xb2
   is reached only when bn - NDIRECT >= NINDIRECT, which the premise
   (bn < MAXFILE) rules out -- the same way both of log_write's panics are
   dead.  The panic credentials are still threaded, because the interior
   acquire's own holding-check arm wants a panic contract regardless.

   THE s4 QUIRK.  gcc saves s4 only on the paths that reach bread
   ([c.sdsp s4,0(sp)] at +0x058 / +0x060 / +0x0b2) and restores it once at
   +0x088; the direct path jumps straight to the shared epilogue at +0x08a
   and never touches it.  So [callee_saved] is established per-arm rather
   than once at the epilogue -- the join at +0x08a is reached with s4
   either restored or never written.  That is a fact about bmap's PROOF;
   the contract below just says [callee_saved m mf].

   THE BITMAP IS AN INVARIANT, because balloc's is.  bmap takes the two
   superblock cells and the persistent [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv] and says
   nothing about the bitmap on the way out (claude-notes/design/fs-bitmap.md,
   "Who owns bitmap_res between calls").

   [BMAP_NOALLOC] below is UNCHANGED by this: with all three allocation
   sites dead there is no balloc, hence no bitmap and no superblock cell.

   bmap SLEEPS (bread, and balloc), so it threads the full running-process
   bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does.  It enters and returns at noff 0. *)

(* [wp_bmap_gen] below is the SET-FORM contract: it takes [LogInv.log_opS]
   rather than [log_op], so the caller can see WHICH blocks this call put
   into the transaction's logged set and absorb its own later writes of
   them.  The counted [wp_bmap_sconf] above is this contract with the set
   forgotten -- [log_op] IS [∃ Sb, log_opS], so the counted seal runs the
   credited proof at whatever set that existential was hiding, claiming no
   credit ([cr := false]).  [BMAP_NOALLOC] never had a budget at all and is
   untouched.

   THE ONE CREDIT IS THE BITMAP BLOCK.  There is exactly one
   ([WriteiBudget.one_bitmap_block]), so every balloc of a transaction
   log_writes the same block and only the first pays.  [cr] is the caller's
   claim that it has already paid for it, and the premise
   [cr = true -> bmapstart ∈ Sb] is what makes the claim honest.

   THE COST IS ARM-WISE, and the arm is a FUNCTION of the block map going
   in and coming out -- which is what makes it usable: a caller must be
   able to COMPUTE what a call cost it, and [bm']/[bm] are exactly what it
   already learns from the rest of the postcondition.  A per-call constant
   is not an option: charging the maximum on the direct-hit arm busts
   MAXOPBLOCKS for a four-block chunk of writei (the arm that allocates
   nothing must cost nothing), which is [WriteiBudget]'s whole section 9.

   THE SECOND CREDIT -- the indirect block, across ITERATIONS of a caller's
   loop -- is deliberately NOT taken.  [WriteiBudget.wi_cost_bmonly] is the
   accounting that follows (2B+2 = exactly 10 at B = 4, zero slack) and
   [wi_cost_tight] (B+3 = 7) is what the second credit would buy; the
   machinery for it is proven and parked in [WriteiBudget]. *)

(* ===================================================================== *)
(*  bmap FOR A CALLER THAT CANNOT ALLOCATE                                *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* readi calls bmap, and bmap allocates when the slot is zero -- which calls
   log_write.  But fileread does NOT wrap readi in a transaction, so an
   allocating read would hit panic("log_write outside of trans").  It never
   happens because every block below a file's size is allocated
   ([InodeInv.bm_covers] is that statement), and under the single premise

       bv_unsigned (blkmap_get bm fbn) <> 0

   ALL THREE of bmap's allocation sites are dead:

   - the direct slot test at +0x26 and the indirect ENTRY test at +0x80 are
     decided by the premise itself;
   - the indirect-BLOCK test at +0x4c is decided by the premise TOO, and
     that is why this contract needs no second hypothesis about bm_ind:
     [blkmap_wf]'s "no indirect block => no entries" conjunct read backwards
     ([InodeInv.blkmap_wf_ind_nz]) turns "the entry at an indirect index is
     nonzero" into "the indirect block exists".

   So the contract drops EVERYTHING the allocation arms needed:

   - no [log_op] and no budget premise -- bmap performs no [log_write], so
     there is no reservation to spend and none to hand back;
   - no [log_ctx], and hence no [γ : log_names] at all;
   - [bslot] rather than [bslots 3].  The three were bread's one held
     across balloc's two; with balloc dead only bread's own unit remains,
     and brelse returns it.

   ...and the postcondition is correspondingly exact rather than
   existential: the map and the file's data come back UNCHANGED, and a0 is
   [blkmap_get bm fbn].  It is the same 70 instructions and the same proof
   body as [BMAP] -- see ProofBmap.v's [BmapCore], which is parameterised
   by whether the allocation arms are live and is where BOTH contracts come
   from.  Precedent for two contracts over one function: SpecWalk.v's
   [WALK] / [WALK_NOALLOC]. *)

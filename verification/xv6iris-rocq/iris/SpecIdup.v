(* SpecIdup.v -- the public interface of idup(), stated over the REAL inode
   cache and no longer assumed.

     struct inode *idup(struct inode *ip) {
       acquire(&itable.lock);
       ip->ref++;
       release(&itable.lock);
       return ip;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.idup = 0x800031a6, 54 bytes (ilock begins at 0x800031dc):
   a 32-byte ra/s0/s1 frame around one acquire / [ip->ref++] / release.  No
   branch, no sleep, and no callee besides the lock pair -- idup is the
   SMALLEST function that exercises the whole icache design end to end,
   which is why it is proven before iget and iput.

   ---- WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT BROKE NOTHING --------------------------

   This contract used to be an [Axiom] in [LinkIdup.v], stated over
   [ProcInv.cwd_ref] -- i.e. over [FileInv.inode_ref], which is literally
   [emp].  The header then explained that nothing about [ip->ref] or
   [itable.lock] was statable against real code because no inode model
   existed.  [IcacheInv.v] is that model, so the excuse is gone.

   Restating it was free because idup HAS NO CALLERS: nothing in the tree
   applies [wp_idup_sconf] (iput, by contrast, has two).  The old
   postcondition could not survive the change in any case -- it returned
   [cwd_ref ip ∗ cwd_ref ip], i.e. fraction 1 twice, which is satisfiable
   only while the predicate is [emp].

   ---- IT TAKES A SHARE, AND HANDS THE SHARE BACK BESIDE A NEW REFERENCE ----

   [ip->ref++] does not need a reference to start from.  It needs a claim
   that the entry cannot be freed underneath it, and a count-0 SHARE
   ([IcacheRef.inode_shr]) is already that: it carries a positive slice of
   the slot's liveness unit, which blocks the last close
   ([IcacheInv.live_whole_share_absurd]), so the entry stays.

   WHAT THE INCREMENT DOES IS NOT AN UPGRADE, and this is where our algebra
   parts company with the natR version this contract was ported from.  Under
   [natR] a share IS authority mass, so "share (q,0) becomes reference (q,1)"
   conjures nothing and idup can hand back one reference at the share's own
   fraction.  Under [positiveR] the identity budget forbids it: the table's
   retained share is [1/2 - qt] against the authority's [qt] (§13.1b), so a
   new count fragment at [s] would have to be matched by [s] of identity out
   of the TABLE -- and the share's own [s] is already spoken for, as the hole
   in its parent's slice.  A share therefore cannot BECOME a reference
   (design §14.7(3), and [IcacheInv.iref_upgrade_store_au]'s header).

   So the share RIDES THROUGH UNTOUCHED and the new reference is minted from
   the table's retained share, exactly as iget's cache-hit arm mints one --
   which is why its fraction is EXISTENTIAL here (it is a slice of a [qt] no
   caller can name) where the share's is the caller's own.  The old shape
   returned two [q/2] references and cost every caller a factor of two on
   every call; this one costs the caller nothing at all -- kfork's parent
   sheds a share, gets it back, and its cwd fraction is the fraction it came
   in with.

   [(k < NINODE)] is a premise where it used to be derived.  [iref_lookup]
   read the slot's liveness off a COUNT fragment, which names its own slot in
   [dom M]; a share has no count fragment, so the share-side twin
   ([IcacheInv.iref_share_lookup_au]) takes the range as a hypothesis.  Every
   caller has it for free -- [ProcInv.cwd_ref] carries it.

   ---- THE TWO PREMISES A READER SHOULD LOOK AT TWICE -------------------

   [is_itable2] is the itable spinlock over the v2 resource (design §13.2/
   §13.3: the pure slot->inum map [ci] and the uncached POOL ride inside it
   alongside the authority half).  idup moves only the [ref] word and [M],
   so both of those ride through its critical section untouched (§13.4).

   It is instantiated AT THE CALLER'S [dev], because the table is
   single-device (§13.11): the region and the pool are inum-keyed, so
   "cached" has to be decidable from inums alone, which holds exactly when
   every cached entry names one device -- [BioInv]'s [bv_dev V] for the
   inode cache.  idup neither reads nor writes an identity cell, so for IT
   the parameter is pure pass-through; it is iget's recycle that has to
   re-establish the clause, and iget's scan that would otherwise be unable
   to.  The caller supplies the same [dev] its reference already names, so
   this costs nothing at any call site.

   [itable_inv γ] is where the [ref] WORDS live -- not in [itable.lock]'s
   resource.  idup writes one while holding the lock, so it opens the
   invariant and joins the two halves of the authority; that the halves meet
   only under the lock is exactly what makes [lw; addiw; sw] atomic in the
   proof.  See [IcacheInv.v]'s header for why the words cannot live in the
   lock (ilock and iunlock read them holding nothing).

   [iref_slot] is what makes the increment SAFE, and it is not bookkeeping.
   [ip->ref++] is unconditional, so it cannot re-establish "the count is
   still an int" on its own -- the missing step is false at 2^31 - 1 and no
   axiom may assert it ([IrefSlots.v]'s header, and [SpecFiledup.v]'s before
   it).  A unit of the FIXED supply is evidence that the system has an
   actual place to keep the new reference, and it is the caller's job to
   bring one, exactly as filedup's caller brings an [fd_slot].

   The SIE/[cpu_own] bookkeeping is [SpecFiledup.v]'s, and for the same
   reason: a fully-nested acquire/release leaves [n], [eb] and the SIE
   index [b] as they came in.  Unlike filedup's, this is now DERIVED from
   the two lock contracts rather than asserted.

   ---- WHY THIS CONTRACT WIDENED IN INCREMENT IVe -----------------------

   iclaim-ledger.md §3.3 approved widening [SpecIget], [SpecIdup] and
   [SpecIput] with [ireg_inv] + the index params; IIIe executed that for the
   other two and idup's was BLOCKED on the doc's own OPEN(2.6b).  §3.19's
   RULING closes it and this increment executes the widening, so the
   paragraph that used to stand here (a full account of the block) is
   superseded.  The short version of what it said, because it is still the
   reason this contract's shape is what it is:

     [ip->ref++] is a ledger move, and RULING A (§3.1, A-AUs) gave every
     UP-count the same premise -- a borrowed [IgetLic.iname fsc_ireg fsc_fs inum l].
     idup's TWO call sites are both [idup(p->cwd)] (ProofKforkB4:365 and
     ProofNamex:5660) and NEITHER can produce a licence at ANY of the five
     constructors: [LinkedL] wants an [ipaid], [HeldL] and the region-side
     [*_alloc] lemmas want a [dinode_at] (idup reads no dinode and neither
     does its caller), [ClaimL] wants an [iclaim], [RootL] wants the inum to
     BE the root, [BufL] is boot-only -- and a cwd is not even [nlink <> 0],
     since xv6 permits unlinking a process's cwd.  The licence-free
     ARITHMETIC route ([IcacheInv.ireg_icnt_acc]) does not do it either: it
     refutes the two frozen phases from [ireg_frz_ok]'s pins ([FrzPost => n
     = 0], [FrzPre => n = 1]) and so needs [2 <= n], while a cwd held by one
     process sits at [n = 1] exactly -- the one value [FrzPre] admits.

   WHAT CLOSED IT is §2.6b's own recommendation, landed as RULING A⁗'s
   frozen park (§3.16): the freeze arm PARKS the dying reference's liveness
   slice and the escrow arm's half inside [IcacheEscrow.islot2]'s live arm,
   where a foreign idup taking the itable lock finds them.  So idup's mover
   is now [IcacheInv.iref_upgrade_mir_store_au] -- the licence-free
   up-count -- and what it presents in place of a licence is the LOCK's own
   [false] mirror half, decided by [IcacheInv.frz_park_shr_off] out of the
   caller's OWN SHARE.  [inode_shr] is enough; no licence, no REF-1, no
   count restriction.

   THE PRICE, AND IT IS EXACTLY SpecIget's (§3.19(d), the in-campaign
   precedent): the mover's up-count carries the ledger's [icnt] half, whose
   other half lives in [InodeRegion.ireg_slot], so this contract takes
   [ireg_inv fsc_ireg fsc_fs inodestart nib] and the [inodestart] binder that goes
   with it -- and, because [ireg_inv]'s own type has [Xv6Cameras.logG] as a real
   instance argument (its [ireg_ep] carries a [log_epoch_lb], §G.13/§G.17),
   the Context gains [!logG Σ].  The handle is PERSISTENT, so it costs a
   caller a frame and nothing else, and the region open is GHOST-ONLY: idup
   reads no dinode, and the only column that moves is [icnt].

   WHAT THIS CONTRACT DELIBERATELY DOES *NOT* TAKE is SpecIget's
   [bv_unsigned inum < 16 * Z.of_nat nib].  iget needs it as a premise
   because its recycle arm asks for an inum that is by construction NOT
   cached, so no table clause can speak about it.  idup's inum IS cached --
   the caller's share names a live slot -- so the bound comes out of
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_ci_wf]'s third clause inside the proof, off the very
   [ci !! k] the mint already reads.  Every caller would have had it (both
   sites hold [IcacheHeld.inode_held]'s), but at [icfg_nib] rather than at
   this contract's generic [nib], and deriving it costs the proof one
   [destruct].                                                             *)

     STATED OVER [IcacheHeld.inode_held] -- the POINTER-keyed package --
     because that is what idup's two callers already hold: kfork's parent
     block and namex's cwd both carry [inode_held] and, before SIMP-2,
     had to open it, shed a share by [inode_ref_shed], hand the share and
     the unit across, and then re-assemble TWO packages out of six
     returned rows.  All of that was bookkeeping the contract could do
     once: the carve ([IcacheRef.inode_refp_carve]) and the gather are
     equivalences, so moving them inside costs nothing and deletes the
     [s] / [dev] / [inum] binders along with four rows.

     Why the mover still only needs a share: [ip->ref++] does not need a
     reference to start from, only a claim that the entry cannot be freed
     underneath it, and a count-0 slice of the liveness unit is already
     that (see the header).  The share is carved out of THIS package, the
     count fragment stays with the short parent, and the two rejoin before
     the return -- so the caller's fraction is the fraction it came in
     with, exactly as before.

     Why the second package is a package and not a bare reference: the
     mint is SELF-PAYING (item 7a-wire, §5''.3's step 3).  The unit inside
     the argument buys the two side conditions
     [InodeRegion.ireg_ref_ok_mint] owes -- allocatedness at either
     flavour, and [c = None] at the plain one -- so idup needs no licence,
     which is what §3.11's wall said it could never have; and the COPY is
     minted at the PARENT's flavour, which is what keeps (R3) true.  Under
     RULING C' that flavour is the plain one at every rest home, so both
     packages that leave are [inode_refp]-shaped and iput-ready.
       AT ITS INUM (lane C1): the package comes in pinned to [z] and both
     packages leave pinned to the same [z] -- idup moves the count word
     and nothing else, so the identity the caller's reference carries is
     the identity the copy carries.  The process block's cwd tie
     ([ProcInv.cwd_ref_at]) is what needs this: namex lends the cwd
     reference through this call and must return it AT ITS INUM. *)

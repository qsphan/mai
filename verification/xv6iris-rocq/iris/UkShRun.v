(* THE SCOPE OF THE WALK: a tree with no REDIRECT and no PIPE node in it.

   The two arms this excludes are the two that MOVE THE PROCESS'S
   DESCRIPTOR TABLE -- REDIR is [close(fd); open(file)] and each half of a
   PIPE is [close(0 or 1); dup(p[i]); close(p[0]); close(p[1])] -- and a
   descriptor move is spent against the program-side LEDGER
   ([UserFd.ustd], [UkSh.ush_std]), which this walk does not carry.  So
   they are REFUTED here rather than assumed away, exactly as the parser
   refutes its five constructor arms from [UkShParse.ushp_no_symbols]:
   [ush_cmd] pins the node's type word, so a tree that is [ush_simple]
   cannot reach the jump table's rows 2 and 3 at all and their code is
   never fetched.

   IT IS THE SAME SCOPE THE PARSER ALREADY HAS.  A command line with no
   symbol byte in it ('<', '>', '|', '&', ';', '(') parses to a single
   EXEC node -- [UkShParse.wp_kshp_parser]'s [UshpExec toks] -- so the
   premise is discharged by the shape of what stage 4 hands stage 6, not
   by an assumption about the input.  Threading the ledger through the two
   excluded arms is the fd-row port's work; when it lands, this premise
   comes off. *)

  (* without [shk_code] at the child's text name it cannot walk its return.  *)
  (* [D] rides through exactly as it does at the leaf: sh's descriptors are
     the point of the PIPE and REDIR arms, and both processes get them. *)
  (* CWD-INDEXED (lane E4): the leaf already hands both processes the same
     working directory ([UkFork.wp_uk_ecall_fork_any] at [cwv]), so the
     VALUE crosses the fork and the arm can name it.  [wp_kshr_fork1_any]

     mints.  The console credential travels on exactly those three, so the

  (* AT ONE CLASS ([ukn_const]).  The EXEC arm pays its deposit out of the
     exec supply AT THIS RECORD'S OWN PAYLOAD ([UkRun.uxsup_at]), which is
     what the supplier names, so nothing here reads whether that payload is
     trivial.  A caller whose record IS trivial passes [UkRun.uxsup] and
     rewrites by its own equation.
     ...BUT THE PAYLOAD IS FREE ALL THE SAME (lane KILL-PAY, K4(a), ruling
     R-B).  The earlier promise -- "runcmd becomes usable by a process that
     owes its parent something" -- is WITHDRAWN: this walk ends in [exit],
     and exit's leaf takes the payload out of the program's own hand now
     ([UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_exit]), which a record at a real resource
     cannot supply from nothing.  THE FACT that makes the Coq-level premise
     below honest is that EVERY process which runs [runcmd] is sh's FORKED
     CHILD, whose record is trivial ([UkFork.wp_uk_ecall_fork_any]'s child
     arm gives the equation) -- sh itself never calls it -- so
     [UkRun.ukn_pay_free_of_triv] discharges it at every call site. *)

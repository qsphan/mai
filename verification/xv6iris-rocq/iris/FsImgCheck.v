(*  (and the seccomp binary) ARE the tracked ELF raws, byte for byte.      *)
(* ====================================================================== *)

(*  WHAT THIS FILE IS.

    [ElfKernel.v] and [ElfUser.v] check that each generated dump IS its
    binary, read through the general ELF semantics of [ElfFile.v].  This
    is the same move one layer out: [FsImgDisk.fsimg_dk] is the literal
    2,048,000-byte image mkfs wrote (kernel-rocq/FsImgRaw.v), and the
    theorems below read it through the general file-system semantics of
    [FsImg.v] -- the superblock parses, [fsimg_wf] holds, and

        /cat /echo /grep /init /sh /sync /seccomp  resolve, in the ROOT
        DIRECTORY, to inodes 3 4 6 7 13 22 23, whose CONTENT BYTES are
        literally [ElfUser.cat_elf], [echo_elf], [grep_elf], [init_elf],
        [sh_elf], [sync_elf], [seccomp_elf].

    ...and ONE NAME THE ROOT DOES NOT HOLD: [fname_f], the file
    application's `f` (claude-notes/design/app-file.md).  Its absence is
    [FsFPin]'s sentence, off this file's own [fsimg_path_root] scan --
    the same computation [FsConsPin] pays for `console`.

    THE CHAIN THAT CLOSES HERE.  [ElfUser.v] proves things about five
    [pstring] blobs: they are well-formed ELF64s, their file-backed images
    are the tracked [<P>Instrs]/[<P>Data] maps, their entries and segment
    geometry are the dumps' constants.  Until now nothing said those blobs
    had anything to do with the machine the proofs run: they were the
    contents of [user/_<p>] on the build host.  The five [fsimg_<p>_at]
    equalities are the missing link -- the bytes exec() will read out of
    the FILE SYSTEM are those blobs -- so every [ElfUser] theorem now
    speaks about the files IN the file system of the disk
    [SystemAdequacy.xv6_fs_adequacy_xv6Σ] powers on with.  The five
    [fsimg_<p>_ok] corollaries below bundle exactly that and cost no new
    computation: they CITE [ElfUser]'s own theorems.

    THE LEAF RULE, as in [ElfKernel.v] / [ElfUser.v]: the image-check
    leaves may import each other (this one imports [FsImgDisk] and
    [ElfUser]), but NO PROOF FILE IMPORTS ANY OF THEM.  [SystemAdequacy.v]
    imports [FsImgDisk] and NOT this file, which is the whole reason the
    machine-facing half was split out: the ~1 MB of file-content
    [vm_compute] below stays off the system theorem's cone.

    HOW THE HEAVY SENTENCES ARE KEPT FINITE (design/elf.md's rules, and
    FsImg.v's header §"EXECUTABILITY IS A DESIGN CONSTRAINT"):

      - a file's bytes are NEVER read by computing [node_at] directly.
        [FsTree.file_bytes] is quadratic in the file size and rebuilds the
        block once per byte, so at 58 kB that computation does not
        terminate usefully.  [FsImg.node_at_file] is rewritten with FIRST
        (its [fs_blocks_full] premise is [fsimg_blocks_full] below, one
        line off [FsCrash.fs_blocks_length]), which turns it into one pass
        over the file's blocks;

      - a path is NEVER walked through [tree_of_disk] as a whole -- that
        would force every file's contents.  [FsImg.path_at_disk_dir] takes
        a one-step walk down to a single [DirView.dir_first] scan of the
        root directory, which is the [O(nrec)] scan [dirlookup] itself
        performs;

      - [fsimg_wf_ok] reads the superblock, the log header, the inode
        blocks, the bitmap, the root directory and the indirect blocks --
        tens of kB.  It does not force a single file's contents, and a
        conjunct that needed to would be a design error.

    If a [vm_compute] here ever fails, DO NOT weaken the statement.  A
    disagreement between the image and the raws is precisely the event
    this file exists to catch: find the disagreeing byte and fix the
    dumper (or mkfs).                                                      *)

(*  THE REDUCTION IS PAID ONCE, AT [Qed] -- NOT TWICE                      *)
(* ====================================================================== *)

(*  [vm_compute. reflexivity.] REDUCES THE GOAL TWICE: once in the tactic
    engine, and again in the KERNEL, which re-checks the [vm_cast] the
    tactic left in the proof term.  On this file's sentences that is the
    whole cost -- [fsimg_wf_ok] measured 65.9 s of tactic and 62.6 s of
    [Qed] for the same reduction, and the five [<p>_bytes_bool] sweeps
    pay the same way (claude-notes/optimization.md, "[Qed] re-checks and
    therefore DOUBLES every [vm_compute]").

    [vm_eq] builds that cast DIRECTLY -- [vm_cast_no_check (eq_refl rhs)]
    typechecks nothing at tactic time and hands the kernel the one
    reduction it was always going to do.  Same proof term, same VM, half
    the wall clock.

    IT MUST BE THE **RIGHT** SIDE.  [eq_refl rhs] casts [rhs = rhs] to
    [lhs = rhs], so the kernel reduces the heavy side ONCE; the mirror
    spelling [eq_refl lhs] casts [lhs = lhs] and the VM evaluates that
    heavy side TWICE -- measured WORSE than the [vm_compute. reflexivity.]
    it replaces (ElfKernel 54.0 s baseline, 28.7 s right-side, 78.3 s
    left-side).  The two spellings read identically; only the measurement
    tells them apart.

    WHAT IT COSTS, and the reason to reach for it only on the heavy
    sentences: a disagreement now surfaces at [Qed] as the kernel's
    conversion failure, without the goal in view.  When that happens put
    [vm_compute. reflexivity.] back on that ONE lemma to see the
    disagreeing byte -- and then fix the dumper or mkfs, never the
    statement (this file's header). *)

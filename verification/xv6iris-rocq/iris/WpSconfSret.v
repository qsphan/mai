(* WpSconfSret.v -- [wp_sret_s_sconf], the SIE-ENABLING sret leaf at the
   sconf altitude: the last instruction of kernelvec, and the only one in the
   tree that turns interrupts back on by RESTORING a saved bit rather than by
   writing a known one.

   WHY IT IS A SEPARATE LEAF, NOT AN INSTANCE OF
   [WpSmodePtCtl.wp_sret_gpr_r].
   That one is the raw-cell endpoint: it hands the caller mstatus / privilege /
   sepc / the GPR file back as individual cells and knows nothing about the SIE
   choreography.  Everything this file adds is the choreography -- the four
   ghost pieces the flip has to move, the invariant re-seal, the tie's SPP bit
   changing value, the trap CSRs going back into the arm, and the ARM-DEPENDENT
   stack reserve being handed back.  That is exactly the difference between the
   raw csrsi leaf and [WpSconfCsr.wp_csrsi_sstatus_x0_s_sconf], and this leaf
   is the sret twin of THAT one: same premise set, same four-piece flip, same
   index discipline.  Read them side by side.

   THE THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT IN THE csrsi TWIN.

   (1) THE NEW SIE VALUE IS NOT A LITERAL.  [csrsi sstatus,2] sets bit 1, so
   its leaf can prove SIE = '1' from bit theory alone.  SRET assigns
   SIE := SPIE, so the '1' has to come from somewhere -- and it comes from the
   caller's [sret_bits] TRAVELLING HALF, pinned at ('1','1').  Agreement with
   [sconf]'s stationary tie ([IntrDefs.sconf_at_sret]) turns that into a fact
   about the live mstatus, whatever the funnel's [∃ ms] happens to name it, and
   [IntrDefs.sret_sconf_flip] carries it through the SRET tower.  This is the
   step that CLOSES the round trip: no bit theory here knows that this SPIE is
   the one the trap saved; the identification is the caller's, carried by that
   half.  The same half is what pins SPP = '1', hence
   [sret_newpriv ms = Supervisor] -- so the privilege write is
   value-preserving and no separate premise is needed.

   (2) THE TIE ACTUALLY MOVES.  Every SIE flip so far left SPP and SPIE alone,
   so [IntrDefs.sret_tie_congr] merely re-expressed the tie at the new mstatus
   with no ghost update.  SRET writes SPP := 0, so here the tie's VALUE changes
   and both halves must be updated together ([IntrDefs.sret_bits_update]) --
   which is only possible because the caller handed the travelling half over.
   The updated copy at ('0','1') goes into [sie_arm true]'s existential, where
   the next trap will find it.

   (3) THE pc MOVES.  The post is at [ret_pc sepc0], not [pc + 4]; a caller
   that restored an aligned epc rewrites it away with its own
   [ret_pc ep = ep].

   THE INDEX DISCIPLINE IS THE ENABLING ONE, and here it is not an accounting
   convention but the literal truth about the stack.  Pre index
   [trap_res true + n], post index [n] at the enabled arm: the handler is
   holding its own now-dead frame reserve ([kv_frame_slots] slots) on top of
   the [n] the interrupted code owned, and it hands back exactly the [n],
   because [sie_cap]'s enabled arm re-reserves the frame for the NEXT trap.
   Both sides are [kv_frame_slots + n] after the carve, so the stack conjunct
   is untouched -- [iExact] closes it with no arithmetic, exactly as in the
   csrsi twin.

   THE ARM INDEX IS PINNED TO [false].  A trap handler runs with SIE = 0 by
   construction (that is what taking the trap did), so there is no [b] to
   generalize over and no impossible-arm branch to refute -- one of the seven
   leaves that went the same way in the [b := false] slice. *)

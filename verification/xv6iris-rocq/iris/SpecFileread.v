   196 bytes.  FOUR arms plus two early returns, and every one of them ends
   at the same epilogue (+0x58), which is why the register story is uniform
   and the postcondition is a single disjunction on the return value.

   ==== THE REFERENCE, AND WHAT IT ALREADY CARRIES ======================

   fileread takes [file_ref γf k q] at an ARBITRARY q -- it is a borrower,
   not a reference holder: [SpecArgfd]'s caller lends it out of the
   (thread-local) fd table for the duration and takes it back.  It gives the
   reference back unchanged.

   The load-bearing consequence of the payload link (design/file-table.md) is
   that fileread needs NO ghost state to tell a pipe from an inode.  The
   branch at +0x1e reads [f->type] out of the reference's own content
   fraction, so the loaded word IS [fc_type Cf]; the branch being taken is
   therefore the COQ fact [fc_type Cf = FD_PIPE], and [FileInvDefs.file_core]
   -- a function of the content -- then reduces to the pipe end that piperead
   wants.  The "what kind of thing a descriptor names" ghost state that
   design/file-table.md defers is a problem for fileread's CALLERS, which
   must decide what to own before the call; fileread itself learns the type
   by reading it.

   ==== THE ENVIRONMENT, INDEXED BY THE TYPE ============================

   SpecFileclose.v's shape, for the same reason: what a caller must own
   depends on which arm the type selects, and the union would make a caller
   reading a pipe own a file system.

   * FD_PIPE   -> NOTHING.  piperead's whole credential ([is_pipe] and a
                  share of the read end) rides inside the reference; the
                  process block, the kalloc environment and the
                  running-thread bundle are ambient (below).
   * FD_DEVICE -> the [devsw[major].read] slot, and the fact that it is
                  either null or the console's.  Only when the major is IN
                  RANGE: the bounds test at +0x7e returns -1 before the table
                  is ever indexed, so a caller with an out-of-range major
                  owes nothing.
   * FD_INODE  -> ilock's, readi's and iunlock's: the icache seam, the block
                  cache and disk fabric, and the off-borrow invariant.
   * anything else -> nothing; the arm is [panic], discharged against
     [SpecPanic] out of [kernel_data] + [panic_env] below.

   ==== THE FS ENVIRONMENT IS CONTENT-INDEPENDENT (fs-sysfile S4') =======

   [fileread_fs_env] names NEITHER the file's content NOR its descriptor
   slot: it is [SpecFilestat.filestat_fs_env]'s form (which is
   [SpecFileclose.fileclose_fs_env]'s), plus the off-borrow FAMILY.  That is
   what makes it ownable by a SYSCALL, which is the whole point -- a
   descriptor borrowed out of [ProcInv.ofile_slot] comes with its slot, its
   fraction and its content existentially quantified, so a caller can supply
   nothing that mentions any of them.

   Everything per-inode that the old, content-indexed form asked its caller
   for -- the itable slot, the inum, the device, the region bound and the
   lent SHARE -- comes out of the reference itself: [FileInvDefs.inode_pay]
   carries [IcacheHeld.inode_shr_held_gen (fc_ip Cf) (q * Q) g], which names
   the slot, the device and the inum and IS the share ilock wants.
   [fileread_pay_carve] below hands them out and takes the share back; the
   per-slot escrow and sleeplock then come out of the two FAMILIES
   ([ic_escrows], [IcacheEscrow.ic_sleeplocks]) at the slot the payload named,
   and the off LEDGER FRAGMENT comes out of the SAME carve, since it too
   rides the payload ([FileInvDefs.ioff_ref], the FD_INODE arm of
   [file_core_off]).  The postcondition carries no share at all, so nothing is
   left for the generation to be lost through
   ([SpecIunlock] returns the arity-preserving [inode_shr]; the LEND-HALF /
   KEEP-HALF discipline is what re-pins it -- [inode_shr_regen2]).

   ==== WHAT IS AMBIENT RATHER THAN PER-ARM =============================

   THREE of the four arms copy into user memory, so [proc_priv], the kalloc
   environment and the running-thread bundle are premises of the contract
   proper, not of an arm.  That is not a weakening: every caller of fileread
   is a syscall and holds all of them already.  Only the two -1 returns touch
   none of it, and they hand it all straight back.

   ==== WHAT THE POSTCONDITION SAYS, AND WHERE EACH HALF COMES FROM =====

   [fileread_ret n r]: minus one, or a count between 0 and n.  That is
   [PipeInv.pipe_rw_ret] verbatim, and it is what all four arms produce.

   BEYOND THE RANGE EACH ARM PAYS WHAT ITS CALLEE CAN BACK, and
   [fileread_extra] is where that lands.  The inode arm names the BYTES the
   call left in the caller's buffer ([FsAbsReadFire.read_post_ok]'s tie,
   out of the abstract file row it fires on); the console arm names their
   TAGS ([console_receipt], out of consoleread's own ledger, which is out
   of the console ring's coupling).  A pipe and every other device major
   say nothing, and that is INHERITED rather than lost: nothing below them
   describes what they delivered.  The file's OFFSET appears on no arm --
   the borrow protocol keeps it inside the inode's ledger and no
   caller-held resource records it.

   ==== THE OFFSET, AND THE ONE PREMISE IT FORCES =======================

   [f->off] is not a content field: it lives in its INODE's off ledger
   ([FileInvDefs.ioff_escrow]) and is BORROWED across the readi call under
   [ip->lock] ([FileOff.ioff_checkout]/[ioff_checkin], off-ledger ruling).
   fileread is the whole reason that protocol exists.  Two consequences for
   this contract:

   * the environment carries the LEDGER FAMILY and nothing per-file: the
     cell lives in the file's INODE's ledger ([FileInvDefs.ioff_escrow],
     one permanent invariant per itable slot), the membership fragment
     rides the descriptor's own payload and comes out of
     [fileread_pay_carve], and ilock's valid cell is the checkout marker.
     The value is existential in the ledger, and its [off_wf] bound is what
     makes it usable;
   * readi's joint numeric premise [off + n < 2^32] has to be discharged from
     a bound on [n] ALONE, because nothing in memory bounds a freshly loaded
     offset.  Hence [MAXFILE * BSIZE + n < 2^31] below -- which is STRONGER
     THAN READI NEEDS: readi takes both uints at the full 32-bit range, so
     [off <= MAXFILE*BSIZE] leaves only [n < 2^32 - 274432], and the
     [n < 2^31] this contract wants anyway (piperead's and consoleread's
     [int] contracts, through [fr_n_range]) covers it.  Restating this
     premise as [0 <= n < 2^31] is what retires the debt sys_read inherits,
     and it is mechanical: three uses in ProofFileread.v, one of them
     readi's.  See claude-notes/design/file-table.md, "The value bound is
     load-bearing". *)

     The gname-free form of this bundle hid BOTH the ring's names and the
     credential the ring's dirty marker stands for, which is what kept the
     console out of every names record.  A READ cannot use that form: the
     window a read hands back is stated at the AMBIENT [fsc_cons] (the
     trap route's per-number post row has no gname parameter of its own)
     and the credential the tokenless arm pays is the application's own
     [AppInv.app_rdcred] -- so [SpecSysRead] takes [ConsoleInv.console_inv
     fsc_cons app_rdcred _], and an existential over the first two arguments
     cannot be specialised to it.

     THE PIN IS AT THIS TIER because this is the lowest file that names
     both: [ConsoleInv] sits below [FsCfg] (which carries [fsc_cons]) and
     below [AppInv] (which defines [app_rdcred]), and it must, since the ring
     is device state and the file system's config is not.  Only the GNAME

  Proof using . by iIntros "(_ & _ & $)". Qed.

  (* ONE cell, and only when the major is in range.  The disjunction is the
     honest statement of what the kernel installs: [consoleinit] fills
     [devsw[CONSOLE]] and nothing fills any other entry, so a read slot is
     either null (and the code returns -1) or [consoleread]. *)
  (* KEYED ON THE MAJOR ITSELF, not on the file: [FdSlots.FdDevice] carries
     the number, so the descriptor's state is all a caller needs to say which
     entry it is talking about.  The lower bound joins the range test because
     the index is now a plain [Z] rather than a [bv_unsigned] -- out of range
     EITHER WAY is [emp], which is what keeps the accessor total. *)
  (* ...AND THE NON-NULL SLOT IS THE CONSOLE'S, which is a fact about the
     TABLE and has to be carried HERE (app-echo.md, lane CONS-CURSOR, C3).
     fileread branches on the CELL it loaded, so at the indirect call it
     knows only that the cell is consoleread's address; but consoleread now
     asks its caller for a PAYMENT ([ConsoleInv.cons_pay]), and the payment
     is what [fileread_in]'s console arm supplies -- at the major [CONSOLE]
     and nowhere else.  Without the tie the arm would have to pay for a
     console read it cannot recognise.  It is TRUE of the real table
     ([ConsoleInv.devsw_read_val_is_console]: nothing but consoleinit ever
     writes [devsw], and it writes one entry), and
     [fileread_devsw_of_console] is where it is discharged. *)
  (* ...AND THE DISJUNCTION IS EXCLUSIVE (lane KILL-PAY, K4(b)(i)).  The
     null slot is a slot that is NOT the console's: [consoleinit] fills
     [devsw[CONSOLE]] with a symbol that is not null, so a cell the code
     found empty cannot be the console's cell.  Without the left arm's
     [mj <> CONSOLE] the walk's [devsw[major].read == NULL] exit would
     still have to answer for a console read -- and that exit returns -1
     while paying nothing, which is exactly what
     [console_receipt]'s -1 arm may no longer accept for free
     ([fileread_extra_dev_m1]).  It is read off the table at

  (* THE CARVE ITSELF -- [SpecFilestat.filestat_pay_carve] GROWN BY THE TYPE
     WITNESS.  An FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE file's payload IS a share of its
     inode's reference, generation-named, parked beside the cancel token
     ([FileInvDefs.inode_pay]) TOGETHER WITH that generation's [ity_shot] and
     the "a writable fd is not a directory" fact.  So a function that holds
     the descriptor's reference already holds everything the old,
     content-indexed environment asked its caller for: the slot, the device,
     the inum, the region bound, the share, the type witness and its
     non-directory side condition.  This hands them out and takes the share
     back ([ity_shot] is persistent, so it needs no return).

     fileread uses only the first six outputs; filewrite needs [ty] and the
     [fc_wbool] implication as well, which is why the GROWN form lives here
     rather than a second, smaller copy living in SpecFilewrite.

     THE FOURTH OUTPUT'S SIBLING IS THE OWNER'S RULING SURFACED (2026-08-29),
     and this lemma is where the file layer hands it to a syscall.  The
     payload's fifth conjunct says an FD_INODE fd's inode is not a
     T_DEVICE; it can only be read HERE, because the generation it is keyed
     on is the payload's own [fp_ig] and nothing above this carve names it.
     A caller joins the [ity_shot] output to ilock's copy with
     [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot_agree] and the row is a FILE or a DIRECTORY --
     which is what refutes [FsAbs.abs_node]'s [ADev] arm on a write (and so
     keeps [SpecFilewrite]'s post at two arms) and gives read its
     "FdInode => AFile or ADir" tie.  The invariant-level
     statement of the same fact is [FileInvDefs.inode_pay_not_dev]. *)
  (* THE OFF OUTPUT IS TYPE-INDEXED (r25 item 24, the visibility-free
     off cell): the FD_INODE arm hands out the file's OFF BOX HANDLE
     ([FileInvDefs.off_fd] -- the box, its membership in the inode's rows,
     the register and count halves at [q], and the stamps share), and the
     FD_DEVICE arm hands out the free cell at [q].  Both come back through
     the wand at the same fraction.  The box's names [γb] are the payload's
     own [fp_obox pn], so the carve exposes them existentially: a returned
     handle at OTHER names could not be rejoined to the payload. *)

  (* =================================================================== *)
  (*  THE ONE INPUT AND THE ONE OUTPUT, KEYED ON THE DESCRIPTOR STATE     *)
  (* =================================================================== *)

  (* ONE SPEC PER SYSCALL.  fileread has ONE contract, over every descriptor
     kind, and what the descriptor's STATE keys is a caller-supplied INPUT
     ([fileread_in]) and an armed OUTPUT ([fileread_arms]) -- the same key
     the CODE branches on ([f->type], after the [f->readable] test).

     - an open, READABLE INODE: the observation commit at this file's inum,
       conjoined with the caller's own REFUND (the REFUNDS ruling: every
       one-shot piece is [AU /\ R], both conjuncts out of one context, the
       two carried in the one pair [PieceFam.pfam]).  Read
       has exactly ONE such piece -- one lock hold, the whole transfer inside
       it, so one instant and no chain.  The arms are
       [FsAbsReadFire.read_arms]: the receipt on a non-negative answer, the
       piece back UNSPENT on the sign guard, the FIRED receipt at advance 0
       on a copyout fault.
     - an open, READABLE CONSOLE (major [ConsoleInv.CONSOLE]): the
       CONSOLE RECEIPT, [console_receipt] below -- one persistent tag per
       byte the call left in the caller's buffer, out of consoleread's own
       ledger.  It costs the caller nothing to supply, because there is no
       input to arm: the tags come off the console ring, which the kernel
       already owns.
     - everything else -- a pipe, any other device major, an unreadable or
       closed descriptor -- costs nothing and gets the landed blanket back.
       A PIPE AU is out of scope and deliberately not invented here.

     THE OFFSET RIDES IN THE PIECE, BUT THE ADVANCE DOES NOT.  fileread
     advances [f->off] and the kernel owns only half of the offset's
     shadow; the commit lends the kernel's half at the offset the read used
     and takes it back UNMOVED ([FsAbsReadFire.aread_commit_at]), and the
     fire lemma advances it out of the descriptor's [foff_row], which this
     contract takes beside the input. *)
  (* ...AND THE CONSOLE ARM IS NO LONGER [emp] (app-echo.md, lane
     CONS-CURSOR, C3, and the LEASE ruling).  A read of the console is
     [ConsoleInv.cons_acc] at the read credential [AppInv.app_rdcred]: ONE
     ARM, whose two disjuncts are the two kinds of caller.

     A LEASE HOLDER supplies the reader token at its own cursor together
     with the wand that turns consoleread's [cons_out] into what it wants to
     know -- for sh, that the window began at ITS position, and the token
     back advanced.  A TAINTED OR GENERIC CALLER supplies [app_sup] itself
     (the left arm of [app_rdcred]), the credential it already holds, and owes [Rd] at every position, which
     for a caller that tracks nothing is [True].

     THAT IS WHY THERE IS NO [option] HERE ANY MORE.  The two callers differ
     in WHICH DISJUNCT they hand in, not in the shape of the deposit, so one
     leaf and one post serve both -- which the [option] could not do,
     because a post cannot name a number a premise hid under an existential
     and the [None] post was therefore [emp].  The [option] survives BELOW
     this tier, in consoleread's own contract ([ConsoleInv.cons_pay] /
     [cons_out]), where the two callers really do arrive holding different
     resources.

     THE KERNEL CANNOT MAKE CONSOLE READING EXCLUSIVE, and that is what the
     second disjunct is for: the generic slot's supply law
     ([UexecExecInst.xv6_sbundle_of_supply_ne], a FIELD of [UexecSG]'s
     class) has to produce read's deposit at every number for an ARBITRARY
     program OUT OF A PERSISTENT SUPPLY ([□ ssupply]), and an exclusive
     token is not merely absent there -- as a [□] premise it is
     inconsistent.  [ARM-c] retired [app_sup] as a credential the kernel
     NEEDED, not as one a caller may spend. *)
  (* ...AND THE WHOLE INPUT IS A WAND FROM THE CALLER'S EXIT PAYLOAD [P]
     (app-echo.md, "SH-LINE RULING", R1).  A program whose payload holds
     the console READER TOKEN cannot hand a [cons_acc] in while it is
     trapping, because the payload itself is what it hands the kernel at
     every trap ([UexecRet.uexec_pay_dep]) and it holds no second copy.
     So the deposit is a WAND: the kernel, which has just taken the
     payload off the trap's payment row, feeds it back in here, and the
     console arm returns it INSIDE what the caller asked to be told
     ([Rd]), at the position the read landed on.

     P IS THREADED THROUGH EVERY ARM, and consumed by the console arm
     alone.  On every other arm the wand hands [P] straight back, so a
     caller pays nothing for it by framing; on the console arm it is the
     resource the caller opens to find its token in, and it comes back out
     through [cons_acc]'s own wand at [fun cur dc => P ∗ Rd cur dc].
     [fileread_extra] then returns [P] to the dispatcher on every arm
     alike, which is where it goes back on the trap's resume row
     ([SpecSyscall.sysc_pay_out]).

     WHY THE ARMS ARE SPELLED OUT rather than factored through the landed
     body at a re-keyed [Rd]: the landed body's non-console arms do not
     mention [Rd] at all, so a factored form would DROP [P] there and the
     extra could not pay it back.  One match, [P] in every arm. *)

     The receipt is stated at the position [cur] the ring's committed

     [cur .. cur + d).  [cons_stored_lb] is the bound on the sequence --
     persistent, and any two of them agree on every index both have, so two
     successive reads by one holder of the token line up end to end -- and
     [cons_chain] is the order along it.

     [cur] IS EXISTENTIAL AND [Rd cur dc] IS WHAT PINS IT.  The caller chose
     [Rd] when it supplied [ConsoleInv.cons_acc]: a lease holder's returns
     [⌜cur = its own n⌝] beside its token back, so its window is at its own
     position and its next read begins where this one ended; a tainted or
     generic caller's returns [True] and the window is just a window.  ONE
     POST, both callers, and no [option].

     THE RECEIPT IS NOT PERSISTENT: [Rd] carries whatever the caller asked
     for, which for a lease holder is an exclusive token.  The -1 arm pays
     [Rd] at an unknown position and advance, because consoleread's killed

     whether a popped byte reached that buffer is a fact about this table
     and nothing else: a destination page the kernel cannot copy to
     ([UserPtTree.uva_wmapped]) swallows it.  The arm that says so is
     consoleread's, and it lands with consoleread's own (app-echo.md,

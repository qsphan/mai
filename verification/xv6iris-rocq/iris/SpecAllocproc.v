   @ KernelSyms.allocproc = 0x80001b28, fifty-five instructions: a 32-byte
   ra/s0/s1/s2 frame, the scan loop (+0x1c .. +0x30), the allocation body
   (+0x38 .. +0x76), one shared epilogue at +0x78, and the two [freeproc]
   failure tails at +0x86 / +0x96.

   THE HEADLINE.  This is the function that turns a [ProcInv.proc_dormant]
   back into a [ProcInv.proc_priv] -- the one producer of the private block
   every syscall consumes -- and it is where the page table's CONSTRUCTION
   side (proc_pagetable, completed/proc-pagetable.md) meets its OWNERSHIP
   side (ProcPtOwn, projects/proc-pagetable-ownership.md), at
   [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt_intro_ppt].

   ON SUCCESS IT RETURNS WITH THE LOCK HELD.  allocproc never releases the
   slot it took: its caller (fork / userinit) keeps writing the child under
   [p->lock] and releases it itself.  So the post hands back
   [SchedCtx.proc_held j gl USED ch] -- the lock token and every cell the
   invariant holds unconditionally -- together with the detached private
   block, and [cpu_own] comes out at [S lvl] with the matching
   [arm_pay].  On the empty-table path (a0 = 0) every lock the scan
   touched has been released and [cpu_own] is back at [lvl].

   TWO CONTRACTS, ONE PROOF.  [ALLOCPROC_GEN] below states what allocproc
   does at ANY page budget: there both failure tails are live code, they run
   freeproc for real, and the third arm of [allocproc_post] is what they
   return.  [ALLOCPROC] is the COUNTED specialisation -- with more than
   [K_allocproc] free pages neither the trapframe [kalloc] nor
   proc_pagetable can run dry, so that third arm is REFUTABLE from the
   caller's own premise and a counted caller never sees a resealed budget.
   The refutation is thirty lines (ProofAllocproc's [AllocprocSeal]); the
   instruction-level proof is elaborated once, for both.

   WHAT THE POST SAYS ABOUT THE PROCESS.  Its user address space is EMPTY
   ([pv_upt V = upt_desc root tfp], whose [ud_um] is the empty map): the
   table maps TRAMPOLINE and TRAPFRAME and nothing else.  Every descriptor is
   null and [cwd] is 0, straight out of the dormant block, so the caller owes
   no file reference.  [p->sz] and [p->name] are whatever the block already
   held -- allocproc writes neither, and freeproc's zeroing of them has no
   consumer (design/proc-struct.md).  The pid is existential: the inlined
   allocpid scan (ProofAllocproc.v's [wp_ap_pidsec]) promises nothing about
   the value it picks, only that the lock is taken and released.

   THE SAVED CONTEXT comes back as raw cells, not as a
   [SchedCtx.proc_ctx]: turning "ra = forkret, sp = kstack + PGSIZE" into a
   member of the scheduler's swtch chain is a Löb argument about forkret,
   which belongs to the caller that parks the process, not here.  The twelve
   callee-saved slots are existential -- memset zeroed them, but nothing
   consumes that, and a resumed context may not read them. *)

(* The pages allocproc consumes: the trapframe page, plus the three

   TRAPFRAME shares both).  The premise is STRICT -- [K_allocproc < nb] for a
   4-page consumption -- by the kalloc chain's counted-arm convention: a
   [Some 0] remainder would leave the last mappages' [avail_zero] arm
   unrefutable. *)

Definition forkret_pc : mword 64 := mword_of_int KernelSyms.forkret.

(* The postcondition, as a function of the RETURNED POINTER.  Factoring it
   out of the continuation is what lets the proof's shared epilogue (both
   exits join at +0x78) be one lemma: the epilogue moves [s1] into a0, so it
   knows the returned value and nothing else about which arm produced it.

   THE EXIT SIE INDEX IS PER-ARM, WHICH IS WHY [sie_cap_gpr] LIVES IN HERE
   RATHER THAN IN THE CONTINUATION.  allocproc RETURNS HOLDING p->lock on the
   found arm and never releases it, so [acquire]'s unbalanced exit index
   ([false] whatever the entry [b]) propagates all the way out to the caller
   -- while the null arm, which releases everything, exits at [b].  A single
   [sie_cap_gpr mr K b pme] in the shared continuation is not merely
   unreachable at [b = true], it is REFUTABLE: [sie_arm true pme] owns
   [cpu_hart 0 true pme] and the found arm owns [cpu_hart (S lvl) eb pme],
   which [CpuOwn.cpu_own_arm_excl] contradicts.  So the "found a free slot"
   execution -- an ordinary one -- would have had no derivation at [b = true].
   Nothing in the premises forces [b = false], and nothing about this fails to
   compile: the contract typechecks and only the proof discovers it.

   Stating the whole contract at [b = false] would also have closed the hole,
   but dishonestly: [userinit] is the only caller today and does run at boot
   with interrupts off, yet [fork] -- which is what allocproc exists for --
   calls it from a syscall with interrupts on.  The per-arm index says what is
   actually true, and it is what fork will need, since fork must [release] the
   proc it gets back and [release] demands [sie_cap_gpr … false …]. *)

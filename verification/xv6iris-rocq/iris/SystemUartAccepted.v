(* SystemUartAccepted.v -- THE CONSOLE SAFETY PROPERTY AT THE REAL IMAGE.

   [UartAccepted.run_out_accepted] is the pure tie: for every run of the
   machine from a powered-off, never-booted state, the current power
   cycle's [ObsUartOut Uart0] projection is a SUBLIST of the CONSOLE port's
   [uart_acc] -- the bytes the kernel accepted into that UART.  The tie is
   per PORT (the board has two 16550s); this file takes it at [Uart0],
   which is the one xv6 drives.  This file states it beside the
   adequacy theorem's own conclusion at the xv6 image, which is where a
   reader of [claude-notes/completed/uart-trace.md] expects a trace property
   to be delivered: reducibility, the trace's shape ([ObsTrace.obs_wf]),
   and the acceptance tie, about ONE run.

   WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT.

   * It IS the safety direction the owner ruled (uart-trace.md, ruling 5):
     "no unaccepted byte appears".  Every byte the host saw in this cycle
     was accepted by the driver, in the order the driver accepted it.
   * It is NOT "the bytes appear".  Acceptance is into the transmit FIFO;
     the wire is what the transmitter has actually driven, and a byte can
     be accepted and never sent (LOOP, an FCR clear, or simply a power loss
     before the drain).  That is liveness, and outside [wp_strong_adequacy]
     (uart-trace.md, ruling 5).
   * The statement is about the OPEN cycle at the reached state, and it
     holds at EVERY point of EVERY run (every prefix of an [nsteps] is an
     [nsteps]), so each completed cycle satisfied it while it was open.
     A statement quantified over the completed cycles OF THE FINAL TRACE
     would need each cycle's accepted history to survive its own PowerOff,
     which no ghost does -- see uart-trace.md's "Rejected" section.

   WHY NO LEDGER, AND WHY THE GATE THIS FILE USED TO NAME IS CLOSED.  The
   acceptance content of the trace is a pure step invariant of the language
   and is proved as one ([UartAccepted.v]); this file needs no ledger for
   it.  The paragraph that used to stand here recorded an OPEN gate: the
   ledger's two wands were quantified over an ARBITRARY [γ : uart_names],
   so no client resource could be about THE ERA's UART ghosts at an event,
   and a located receipt (retired in lane OUT-FUPD) could not be turned
   into a pure residue.  BOTH HALVES OF THAT ARE GONE.

   * THE IDENTIFICATION GATE IS CLOSED (lane APP-IFACE item (c)): the wands
     are quantified over the ERA's [fileG] instead, with the two equations
     the boot has -- the era's application record, and [FsCfg.fsc_uart = γ]
     at [i = Uart0], the [γ] every kernel-side UART fact of this era is
     stated at ([App.xv6_app_adequacy]'s [Htx]/[Hrx],
     [SystemAdequacy.xv6_power_adequacy_gen]'s permit premise).
   * THE RESIDUE IS NOT A RECEIPT ANY MORE (lane OUT-FUPD): the located
     prefix receipts are retired.  What crosses to the ledger at a drain is
     the CONSOLE UART invariant's own output CLAIM, lent to [Htx] and given
     back -- [if i is Uart0 then app_out A c ho (uart_acc u) else emp],
     beside the two facts that place it, [⌜u_wire u = u_out u⌝] and
     [⌜ho `prefix_of` h⌝].  Every byte in [uart_acc u] was justified at its
     store by the writer's own view shift.  This file's own hypothesis is
     unchanged -- it is about the pure language invariant, not about that
     claim. *)

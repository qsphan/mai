   of its proof.

     void procdump(void) {
       static char *states[] = { [UNUSED] "unused", [USED] "used",
         [SLEEPING] "sleep ", [RUNNABLE] "runble", [RUNNING] "run   ",
         [ZOMBIE] "zombie" };

       for (p = proc; p < &proc[NPROC]; p++) {
         if (p->state == UNUSED) continue;
         if (p->state >= 0 && p->state < NELEM(states) && states[p->state])
           state = states[p->state];
         else
           state = "???";

   @ KernelSyms.procdump, 164 bytes / 52 instructions: an 80-byte frame
   holding ra/s0 and s1..s7, s1 the cursor (at &p->name, i.e. p + 344 -- gcc
   biases it so the three field reads are negative displacements off it), s2
   the end sentinel, s3 "???", s4 "\n", s5 "%d %s %s", s6 = 5, s7 the
   [states] table.  One loop, three printk calls.

   ====================================================================
   WHAT procdump READS, AND WHY ITS PRECONDITION LOOKS LIKE THIS
   ====================================================================

   procdump takes NO LOCK -- that is deliberate in xv6 ("no lock to avoid
   wedging a stuck machine further") and it is the whole difficulty of
   specifying it.  It reads three fields of every slot:

     p->state  (+24)   lock-protected and genuinely mutable
     p->pid    (+48)   half in [SchedCtx.proc_pub], half in [ProcInv.proc_priv]
     p->name   (+344)  exclusively owned by whoever is RUNNING the process

   -- so [design/proc-struct.md]'s five sharing disciplines give procdump the
   right to read NONE of them.  In separation logic a load needs a fraction of
   the cell, and a fraction is exactly what forbids the concurrent write that
   makes this code racy.  A [%s] argument is worse than an ordinary racy read:
   printk WALKS the string, so [p->name] must be stably owned across the call,
   not merely read atomically once.  No invariant-based "peek" resource can
   supply that.

   So the honest precondition is a read-SHARE of the three fields of all 64
   slots, at fractions the caller chooses, handed back untouched:

       procdump_view  =  [∗ list] j < NPROC, proc_dump_slot (proc_addr j)

   That is the contract, and its being unsatisfiable from anything currently
   in the tree is not a gap in the spec -- it IS the statement that procdump
   is racy.  Discharging it would mean making [state]/[pid]/[name]
   permanently read-shared, which allocproc, kfork (it [safestrcpy]s the
   child's name) and kexec each rule out.  consoleintr's ^P path therefore
   cannot link against this contract; see claude-notes/projects/procdump.md.

   WHAT THE VIEW DOES *NOT* SAY, and why that is the good news: nothing about
   the VALUES.  Every 32-bit [p->state] is handled by the compiled code --
   0 skips the slot, 1..5 index [states], anything else (including negative,
   which the [bltu] against 5 catches together with the C's [p->state >= 0]
   test) prints "???" -- so the state is existential, the pid is existential
   (it is a [%d] vararg and nothing reads it back), and the name needs only
   to BE a C string ([nonul]).  The view is thus a pure read-permission
   claim with no coherence obligation, which is what lets a caller supply it
   at any fractions and get the same thing back.

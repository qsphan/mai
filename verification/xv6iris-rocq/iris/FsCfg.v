(*  FsCfg.v -- THE FILE SYSTEM'S CANONICAL GHOST NAMES.

    There is exactly ONE file system per boot, so its ghost names are
    ambient rather than threaded -- the argument [IcacheRefDefs.icfg] already
    makes for the inode cache ("there is exactly one inode cache per
    system, so threading its gname would put a filesystem ghost name on
    [ProcInv.proc_priv] and hence on the thirty-odd spec files that mention
    it", InodeRef.v).  This class is that argument applied to the rest of
    the fs, and it exists so that [FsReady.fs_ready] can be a predicate with
    NO PARAMETERS.

    ---- WHY PARAMETER-FREE IS THE POINT ---------------------------------

    [fs_ready] is meant to be carried by a running process and handed on --
    forkret's not-forked arm produces it, the trap loop's residue carries
    it, and every later syscall reads it back.  A twenty-parameter version
    can be carried only by existentially quantifying the twenty, and a bare
    existential is useless downstream: a consumer that has been handed
    [∃ γ…, fs_ready γ…] cannot feed it to [KexecDefs.fs_fabric] or to
    [UsertrapRes.ut_res_bare], whose own resources are keyed to the
    CALLER's concrete names, because nothing relates the two.  Ambient
    names remove the existential instead of hiding it.

    ---- WHAT IS NOT HERE ------------------------------------------------

    The four names the inode cache already owns stay in [icfg] and are NOT
    duplicated: [icfg_log] (the log's four gnames), [icfg_ist], [icfg_nib]
    and [icfg_dev].

    ---- AND NOTHING TIES THEM ANY MORE (rank 1) -------------------------

    The fields below arrived through the door [icfg]'s four had used: a
    contract threaded its own copy and a PURE PREMISE ([g = icfg_log],
    [dev = icfg_dev], [γd = fsc_disk], ...) said the two were the same.
    Rank 1 walked that back and closed the door.  NO fs contract threads
    any of these names now -- ranks 1a-1d took [cn], [γfs], [cov],
    [logstart], [γi], the itable lock, [dev], [nib], [inodestart], the
    log's names, the six DEVICE/ALLOCATOR names and the image's three
    numbers off the surface in that order -- so there is no threaded copy
    left for an equation to name, and the three tie records that carried
    them ([FsSyscalls.fs_world], [SpecFileclose.fclose_ties],
    [ProofSyscall.sysc_ties]) are gone or reduced to their PROCESS half.
    Two doors stay open on purpose and both are BOOT-side: the era's own
    image numbers are tied to these fields where the instance is BUILT
    ([FsCfgBoot], [FirstTok], [SpecFsinit]), and everything structurally
    BELOW this file keeps its parameters -- a contract INSTANTIATES
    [log_ctx] / [bio_ctx] / [is_itable2] / [ireg_inv] at the fields, which
    costs nothing.

    [procs_inv]'s [γs] is not here either, and that is deliberate: it is a
    PROCESS name, and it was in [fs_ready] only because [procs_inv] was a
    conjunct.  That conjunct is gone -- it is persistent, every consumer
    already holds it beside the fs environment ([KexecDefs.fs_fabric] lists
    it separately, and forkret's tier carries it in the park package's
    persistent world), and dropping it is what leaves this class with no
    process content at all.

    ---- IT IS PER-ERA, EXACTLY AS [icfg] IS -----------------------------

    A crash re-mints the disk image ghost ([DiskPtsto.dn_img]; see
    claude-notes/design/crash.md, "PowerOn allocates a fresh era record").
    So this is a CLASS ASSUMPTION of each section, instantiated by each
    era's boot chain -- not a global constant.  Nothing in it has to survive
    a crash, because [fs_ready] does not either: the new era re-runs boot
    and builds its own.  *)

     that names the pair itself ([SpecFileclose.fileclose_pipe_env] does --
     pipeclose gives a PAGE back, so it must speak about the count) can
     never show its own name equal to a hidden one.  So the pair is ambient
     too, and [FsReady.fs_ready] carries the lock and the sealed count
     SPELLED OUT, with [kalloc_env] recovered as a projection. *)

     They used to be: [fsc_desc]/[fsc_avail]/[fsc_used], the addresses
     [virtio_disk_init] gets back from three [kalloc]s.  The argument for
     including them was "one door for the whole fs configuration is simpler
     than two, and it costs nothing".  It costs exactly one thing, and it is
     fatal: every field of this record has to have a VALUE at the boot-era
     [fupd] that allocates the file system's ghost state, and these three do
     not exist until [virtio_disk_init] runs, which is WP time.  A field
     cannot be an existential (see the header), so a record that carries
     them cannot be built at all.

     THE DISTINCTION IS THAT AN EXISTENTIAL IS RECOVERABLE HERE AND WOULD
     NOT BE FOR A GNAME.  These are ADDRESSES, and they are pinned by the
     persistent cells inside [DiskInv.disk_geom] ([d_desc_ptr ↦₈□ pd], ...),
     so any two [disk_geom]s at the same [disk_names] agree on them
     ([FsReady.disk_geom_agree]).  So [FsReady.fs_ready] quantifies them
     INSIDE its disk conjuncts -- exactly as [SpecMainSecondary.main_deposit]
     already does -- and a contract that threads its own [pd]/[pav]/[pu]
     carries [disk_geom] at them rather than an equation against a field
     here.  That is a re-spelling, not a weakening: the two forms are
     interderivable in the presence of [fs_ready].  A gname behind an
     existential has no such witness, which is why every OTHER field stays. *)

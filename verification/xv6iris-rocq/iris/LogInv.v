(* LogInv.v -- the log layer's lock invariant: struct log's geometry, the
   reservation LEDGER, the batch bundle the committer checks out, and the
   ghost transitions begin_op / log_write / end_op perform.

   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-log.md.  The shape in one paragraph: the
   "log" spinlock seals [log_res].  Always inside: the outstanding /
   committing / ncommit cells, and the ledger -- a ghost map op-id ->
   REMAINING BUDGET whose auth ties the outstanding cell (its size) and
   whose per-entry bound (<= MAXOPBLOCKS) and sum tie
   (lh.n + op_sum <= LOGBLOCKS) make begin_op's guard a mint, kill
   log_write's "too big a transaction" panic, and stay inductive.  A FLAT
   units counter does NOT work: at end_op the global bound
   units <= out * MAXOPBLOCKS cannot be re-established (the returning
   op's budget and the others' are indistinguishable to an auth-nat), so
   the ledger keeps the per-op structure -- which is also exactly the C
   code's own reservation argument.
   Conditionally inside (cmt = false): [log_state] -- the lh cells with
   their write-set reading W, BOTH FsBlocks auths (the freeze-by-auth
   that makes log_write and the committer the ONLY writers of the logged
   view), the log-side dirty halves recording exactly W's membership over
   the whole covered range, and the log-region + header client halves.
   end_op's last-out path flips cmt := 1 and takes [log_state] out
   linearly, mirroring the code running commit with no locks held;
   begin_op sleeps on cmt, so out stays 0 across a commit, and
   ⌜cmt = true -> out = 0⌝ rides as a pure conjunct (what kills end_op's
   own "log.committing" panic: an op token in hand forces out >= 1). *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* A LEDGER ENTRY: the op's remaining budget, and THE SET OF BLOCKS IT HAS
   ALREADY APPENDED to lh.block[] in this batch.

   The set is what makes log ABSORPTION free.  xv6's log_write scans
   lh.block[] and, when the block is already there, does NOT grow lh.n --
   so a second write of a block a transaction has already logged costs the
   log nothing, and charging the caller a budget unit for it is a pure
   over-approximation.  It was a harmless one until itrunc: that function
   frees up to NDIRECT + NINDIRECT + 1 = 269 blocks, every one of them a bit
   in THE SAME bitmap block (FSSIZE = 2000 < BPB = 8192), so the real cost
   is 2 blocks -- one bitmap, one inode -- while always-consume accounting
   demands 270 units against a MAXOPBLOCKS of 10.  itrunc is not provable
   without the credit, and the C code is not wrong; the accounting was.

   WHY THE SET LIVES IN THE OP ENTRY, rather than in a free-floating token.
   The credit is only sound while the block really is in lh.block[], and
   lh.block[] is cleared at commit.  Any client-held witness must therefore
   be revoked by then -- and the ONE handle the log has on a client's
   resources at commit time is the op entry itself, which end_op collects
   ([log_end_step]) and whose absence is what lets commit run at all
   ([cmt = true -> out = 0]).  A token that outlived end_op would still be
   presentable in the NEXT batch, where the block is no longer logged, and
   the absorb arm would then skip a spend while lh.n actually grew.  So the
   set is a field of the entry, and it dies with it. *)
(* ...AND THE BIRTH EPOCH, which is how §G's group extension stays
   revocation-sound WITHOUT revoking anything (fs-log.md §G.2/§G.9).  The
   entry records the epoch it was minted in; [log_res]'s auth invariant
   pins every LIVE entry's [e0] to the current epoch, and the bump at the
   commit re-deposit cannot falsify that because [out = 0] there forces
   [om = ∅].  A witness from an older batch then has [e < e0] of every
   later op and is simply unusable -- indexing instead of revocation.

   NOTE THE RE-ASSOCIATION: [(nat * gset Z * nat)] is
   [((nat * gset Z) * nat)], so the budget is [e.1.1], the already-logged
   set is [e.2] and the birth epoch is [e.2]. *)
(* [op_entry] and [logG] are defined in Xv6Cameras.v; the argument for
   both the SET and the EPOCH field is above.  The epoch reads the
   AMBIENT [mono_natG] off [riscvGS] ([riscvF_genGS], RiscvPtsto.v)
   rather than minting a second instance -- a second [mono_natG] in one
   context is the duplicate-class trap of claude-notes/durable-notes.md:
   the two make propositions that print character-for-character
   identically fail to unify. *)

  (* THE NAMED FORM: the same entry ownership with the birth epoch EXPOSED.
     [log_use_group] cannot be stated without it -- the client has to write
     [e0 <= e] -- and it must NOT be a separate persistent token: such a
     token outlives its op, so a stale small [e0] would admit a stale
     witness and re-open exactly the hole the header's revocation argument
     closes (fs-log.md §G.9, FINDING 1).  Exposing it on the LINEAR entry
     is what keeps it honest: holding this IS holding the live entry.

     ...AND IT CARRIES THE LOWER BOUND (§G.13).  [log_epoch_lb γ e0] is the
     formal referent of §G.4's "the walker's open op freezes the epoch": a
     client outside the log lock can never mint one, and [log_begin_step] is
     the universal point where every op passes with the auth open, so the
     bound is minted there and rides the entry for the op's whole life.
     The bundle is ABI-INVISIBLE because the lb is PERSISTENT: [log_opS]'s
     arity is untouched, every conversion below holds verbatim, and the
     only ghost step that pays for it is the mint itself.  A LOWER bound
     also needs no revocation -- unlike the refuted persistent birth-epoch
     token, a stale copy stays TRUE, and truth is all it claims.

  (* One element of [ln_tx] per transaction that is open right now, at the

     by begin_op and consumed WHOLE by end_op, and while an inode's
     well-formedness row is suspended the element is parked in the locked
     registry ([InodeRegion.ireg_locked]), which is what makes "no
     transaction is open" imply "no row is suspended" at a commit.

     THE ID IS EXISTENTIAL, and no client ever names it: the ending
     transaction does not have to say which id it retires, because
     [log_res] ties the ledger to the transactions by CARDINALITY
     ([size T = size om]) rather than by identity -- a tie that survives
     any retire, and all a commit needs ([om = empty] forces [T = empty]).

     WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE [log_opS]: a suspended row's owner must keep
     WRITING (create's mkdir writes the two dot entries while its child is

  (* What [log_write]'s contract hands back: the op's OWN ledger entry with
     a NAME for its birth epoch, AND the witness for the block it just
     logged, minted at exactly that epoch.

     WHY THE EPOCH MUST BE THE CALLER'S OWN, not an existential.  Using a
     witness ([log_use_group]) needs [e0 <= e] against the birth epoch of
     the op that is open at the USE.  A bare [∃ e, logged_at γ e b] cannot
     supply that -- any [e] satisfies it, a dead batch's included, and the
     header's revocation requirement is exactly what forbids trusting one.
     Tying [e] to the entry the caller is holding is what makes the receipt
     CURRENCY: the entry is live, so [log_res]'s soundness clause pins its
     [e0] to the current epoch, and the depositor can therefore stamp the
     witness with an epoch it can later order against (§G.3's
     [ic_epoch_lb]).

     The witness rides UNDER the entry's existential rather than beside it
     precisely because the two must agree on the epoch; splitting them into
     two conjuncts would lose the equality and give back the useless form.

     UNCONDITIONAL IN THE ARM (see the note on [log_mint_logged]'s two call
     sites in ProofLogWrite): a log_write that ABSORBED did not append, but
     the block it names is in the header all the same -- that is what the
     absorb arm's scan result says -- so the registry row it mints is just
     as true and just as usable.  §G.10's "non-absorbed arm only" ruling
     priced the absorbed-arm row as a re-proof "from the credit"; at the
     site it is instead immediate from the SCAN, so the arm distinction
     buys nothing and costs every consumer a case split.

     ...AND IT CARRIES THE CALLER'S EPOCH ANCHOR (fs-log.md §G.17,
     blocker 4).  [v] is a lower bound the caller brought in
     ([log_epoch_lb γ v], a premise of [SpecLogWrite.wp_log_write_au]), and
     [⌜v <= e0⌝] is the ONE fact in the whole absorption design that cannot
     be established anywhere else: it is [v <= E] (by [log_epoch_lb_le])
     composed with [e0 = E] (a live entry is born at the current epoch), and
     BOTH halves need the [ln_ep] auth, which lives inside [log_res] behind
     the log spinlock.  Two lower bounds on one counter are incomparable --
     §G.14's own refutation, one tier up -- so a client holding
     [log_epoch_lb γ v] and its own [log_opSe … e0] can do nothing with the
     pair; the cashing has to happen here, at the ghost step, and it is free
     there.  A caller with no receipt to build passes [v := 0].

     [log_opSw_opS] forgets the whole thing, so a caller that does not want
     a witness threads [log_opS] exactly as before.

     THE EPOCH-NAMED FORM IS THE PRIMITIVE (fs-log.md §G.20, the epoch
     tier), and [log_opSw] is it with the epoch CLOSED.  Closing is what a
     receipt's depositor wants -- it compares against its own anchor [v] and
     never against the op's identity -- but it is exactly what a WALKER
     cannot afford: a caller in the middle of a walk has to get its OWN
     [e0] back, because a credit is a claim at a named epoch and two lower
     bounds on one counter are incomparable (§G.14).  Nothing in the ghost
     steps ever moves an open op's birth epoch (every one of them updates
     the entry IN PLACE at the same [e0], and the counter's only transition
     is the commit bump, which runs with no live entry), so naming it costs
     the log_write proof nothing and is simply the truth stated. *)

     different claims:

     - OWN-SET ([b ∈ Sb]): the block is in MY op's already-logged set.  This
       is the only form the pre-group design had, and it is pure: the
       ledger's own soundness clause ([log_res]: every live entry's set is a
       subset of the header) turns it into membership.  Every landed
       credited caller -- bfree's credited arm, balloc's bitmap write,
       writei's [bool_decide] -- claims exactly this, and [log_credit_own]

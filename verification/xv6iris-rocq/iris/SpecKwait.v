   THE CONTRACT.  Three things make it different from every syscall proved
   before it.

   * IT TAKES A SECOND LOCK, AND THE SECOND LOCK'S RESOURCE IS THE POINT.
     [WaitInv.wait_res] -- all NPROC [p->parent] cells and the children
     sets beside them -- is what wait_lock
     protects, and holding it is what licenses BOTH the [ld a5,56(s1)] the
     scan runs on every slot and the [sd x0,56(s1)] that disowns the child.
     [parent] cannot live in [SchedCtx.proc_lock_res]: it is read across
     processes by a holder of wait_lock who holds no proc lock at all, and
     putting it there would make the documented lock order wait_lock ->
     p->lock unstateable.  See WaitInv.v.

   * IT MOVES THE CALLER'S CHILDREN ROW, and that is what makes a reap a
     reap rather than a store.  The row ([WaitInv.ch_frag], off the trap
     residue) is handed in at [cs] and comes back at [cs'], and the
     contract says which member left: the reap takes the reaped generation
     out of it -- out of BOTH columns of the wait-lock invariant, which is
     where "that zombie is my child" lives
     ([WaitInv.children_inv_reap]) -- and every failing arm returns it
     unmoved.  The answer names that generation, so the row's move and the
     escrow that redeems it are one statement
     ([UserChildren.wait_ans]).

   * IT REACHES A ZOMBIE'S PRIVATE BLOCK, WHICH NOTHING ELSE DOES.  The
     child's [ProcInv.proc_dormant _ ZOMBIE] comes out of the child's own
     lock through [SchedCtx.proc_slots]'s [inv_dormant] guard, and
     [SpecFreeproc.fp_of_dormant_zombie] is what turns it into freeproc's
     precondition.  That bridge is exactly the gap SpecFreeproc.v used to
     record as unwritten; closing it is what made this proof possible.

   * WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT THE RESULT IS THE REAPED CHILD'S ESCROW.  The
     return value is a sign-extended [int] ([lw] of [pp->pid] on the found
     arm, [li -1] on the three failure arms), and on the found arm it NAMES
     the generation kwait reaped: the post's [UserChildren.wait_ans] hands
     out that generation's escrow ([ChildTok.exit_tok], the payload its
     exit paid, keyed at the status this call copied out) together with the
     pid uniqueness over the caller's own children ([ChildTok.gen_uniq])
     that makes the number identify it.  Both come off the wait-lock
     invariant, which the reaper holds open across the reap
     ([WaitInv.children_inv_reap] / [children_inv_pid]).
     THE -1 ARM SAYS ONLY THAT NOTHING MOVED, and that is the code: of its
     three exits only the childless one has an empty children reading --
     the other two are a killed caller and a copyout that could not place
     the status, and both happen with children present.

   NOT here: [arm_pay].  kwait's own acquire(&wait_lock) produces the
   level-0 pay that sleep wants, and every exit's release consumes it, so
   kwait as a whole is balanced and must not ask the caller for one -- the
   sys_pause rule (a second [trap_csrs] makes the eb = true precondition
   unsatisfiable and the spec vacuous exactly where interrupts are on).

   [eb = true] IS A PREMISE, for the reason every parking function has it:
   at level 0 with an enabled base the pushing acquire hands out the trap
   CSRs the chain payload demands (SpecSched.v).

   THE PRIVATE BLOCK GOES IN AND COMES BACK AT AN EXTENDED DESCRIPTOR.  The
   only thing kwait does to the caller's own address space is copyout's
   lazy faulting, so the post is [proc_priv] at [upd_upt V P'] with
   [uptd_ext_sz], exactly as fetchaddr's is.  On the three arms that never
   call copyout, [P' = pv_upt V].

   WHAT STAYS EXISTENTIAL IS A LENGTH, NOT AN IMAGE.  The only write kwait
   can make to user memory is copyout's: the found zombie's four-byte
   [xstate] at [addr], and only when [addr <> 0].  The post therefore
   carries [umem_wr (us_M U) addr d (nth_byte xw)] for some [d <= 4] and
   some four-byte STATUS WORD [xw] -- the bytes are that word's, at every
   arm, because a partial copyout still copies a prefix of it.  [xw] is the
   word the ESCROW is keyed at as well (the reaper holds both halves of
   [pp->xstate]), which is what ties the number a parent reads out of its
   own buffer to the payload it redeems.  The [addr = 0] arm, the
   no-zombie-child arm, and copyout's own failure prefix all move nothing:
   they instantiate [d := 0], where [umem_wr M addr 0 bs = M] on the nose.
   A caller reads its own untouched bytes back with
   [UserPtTree.umem_wr_lookup_out]. *)

(* kwait's own ten frame slots, plus the deepest callee below it (copyout's

   THE COPYOUT CALL GETS NO TRAP RESERVE, which is why this is a straight
   10 + 52 rather than piperead's arithmetic.  kwait is [eb]-generic and
   [trap_res false = 0] (IntrDefs.v), so the call site can offer only
   [K - 10]; there is no reserve to borrow against, and 60 leaves the
   obligation at [52 <= 50].  copyout's own budget went 50 -> 52 because
   [psz] has to outlive walkaddr / vmfault / memmove, so gcc gave it a
   callee-saved home in s11 and the frame grew to 14 slots (SpecCopyout.v). *)

(* SpecSysClose.v -- the public interface of sys_close(), stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     uint64 sys_close(void) {
       int fd; struct file *f;
       if (argfd(0, &fd, &f) < 0) return -1;
       myproc()->ofile[fd] = 0;
       fileclose(f);
       return 0;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.sys_close = 0x80004cb2, 24 instructions (see
   CodeSysClose.v for the listing).

   THE POINT OF THIS SPEC.  sys_close is the first proof in which a
   [FileInv.file_ref] LEAVES the process: [proc_priv]'s descriptor [fd] gives
   up the reference it was holding, the descriptor becomes null, and
   fileclose consumes the reference.  Three resources have to line up for
   that, and they are exactly the three ends of the file-table design
   (claude-notes/design/file-table.md):

     - [ProcInv.proc_priv_ofile] borrows descriptor [fd] out of the
       thread-local fd table -- no lock, because the table IS thread-local --
       and takes back a descriptor holding a DIFFERENT value;
     - the reference inside it is what [SpecFileclose] consumes;
     - the [fd_slot] fileclose returns is what re-establishes the EMPTY
       descriptor's own conservation obligation ([ProcInv.ofile_slot]'s left
       disjunct).  Without it the postcondition below would be unprovable --
       which is the whole point of that unit existing.

   The [sd x0,0(a0)] store lands BEFORE the fileclose call, so there is a
   window in which the descriptor is null and the reference is loose in a
   register.  That is not a hole for the same reason sys_dup's window is not
   (design/file-table.md): no other core can reach this process's fd table,
   so the intermediate state never has to be an invariant -- it only has to
   be re-established by the time sys_close returns.

   DETERMINISM.  Which arm runs is a function of the syscall argument and the
   process's own descriptor array, both of which the caller knows, so the
   postcondition says so ([SpecArgfd.arg_fd]) rather than offering an
   unconstrained "closed it, or didn't": a kernel that always returned -1
   would not satisfy this spec. *)

     own ([FdSlots.fd_st_move] needs both halves).

     AT A NAMED TABLE, and the two arms say different things about it --
     which is the whole point of naming it.  The failure arm hands [sts]
     back UNTOUCHED: it closed nothing, and the [arg_fd … = None] beside it
     says why.  The success arm hands back [<[fd := FdClosed]> sts] at the
     very [fd] the argument named, so the slot that moved is the one the
     caller asked about and every other slot is still what it was.  That
     second half is what a caller holding other descriptors needs, and it
     is exactly [UsysMemOk.usys_fd_ok]'s close row read at this
     vocabulary. *)

  (* ---- THE TWO TIES THE PID QUARTER FORCES, and why they are cheap.

     [fileclose]'s FS arm wants a QUARTER of [p->pid] (iput's acquiresleep
     records the holder), and this contract used to take it inside
     [fileclose_fs_env].  That made the premise set UNPAYABLE rather than
     merely large: [ProcInv.proc_priv] owns [p_pid] at ONE HALF and
     [SchedCtx]'s state resource owns the other, so no thread can hold
     [proc_priv] AND a further quarter -- three quarters is more than exists
     outside the lock.  It is the "satisfiable in isolation, refutable at
     the call site" shape durable-notes.md warns about: nothing in the build
     saw it, because the only caller was an [Axiom].

     So the environment below is the NOPID bundle, and the quarter is lent
     out of this function's OWN [proc_priv] for the duration of the
     fileclose call ([ProcInv.proc_priv_pid_ofile] lends it beside the
     descriptor slot, which is exactly what the store to [p->ofile[fd]]
     wants anyway; [SpecFileclose.fileclose_loop_open] is the pairing kexit's
     loop already uses).  The two equations are what identify the lent
     quarter with the one [fn] describes -- [SpecSyscall]'s dispatch
     discharges both, [fcn_pid] by its own [fcn_pid fn = pid] premise and
     [fcn_dq] by [reflexivity]. *)

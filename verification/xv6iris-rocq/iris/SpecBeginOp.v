(* SpecBeginOp.v -- the public interface of begin_op, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void begin_op(void) {
       acquire(&log.lock);
       while (1) {
         if (log.committing) {
           sleep(&log, &log.lock);
         } else if (log.lh.n + (log.outstanding + 1) * MAXOPBLOCKS > LOGBLOCKS) {
           sleep(&log, &log.lock);
         } else {
           log.outstanding += 1;
           break;
         }
       }
       release(&log.lock);
     }

   THE RESERVATION MINT.  begin_op's whole content is the ledger step
   (LogInv.v): the loop exits exactly when the C guard
   [n + (out+1)*MAXOPBLOCKS <= LOGBLOCKS] reads true, and
   [LogInv.log_reserve_ok] turns that conservative test into the exact sum
   tie the invariant needs, so the mint of a fresh full-budget entry
   ([log_begin_step]) is legal precisely there.  That IS the meaning of the
   guard.  The postcondition is one [log_op γ MAXOPBLOCKS] -- the token
   log_write spends a unit of and end_op retires.

   NO DISK FABRIC, NO BIO_CTX.  begin_op touches only the "log" spinlock and
   sleeps on the log itself; it never breads, bwrites or talks to virtio.
   So it takes [log_ctx] plus the running-process bundle and nothing else --
   the one log.c function whose contract is free of the block layer.  The
   [bio_names] binder is there only because [log_ctx] names the slot pool
   parked in [log_state]; no bio RESOURCE crosses this interface.

   It DOES sleep (both arms of the retry loop), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does and enters/returns at
   noff 0, taking the [trap_csrs_ext eb]/[cpu_claim_ext eb pj] COMPLEMENT in
   and out: at [eb = true] its own acquire mints the pair the interior sleep
   needs (the complement is [emp] and no caller gains an obligation); at
   [eb = false] the acquire mints nothing and the pair can only come from the
   caller, who holds it because the TRAP handed it over.  Since it PARKS, its
   crossing is the literal [true], not [b] (SpecAcquiresleep.v's note).

   The [p_pid] cell is threaded for UNIFORMITY with the rest of the log
   layer (write_head / install_trans / initlog / end_op all need it, for
   the acquiresleep inside bread).  begin_op itself takes no sleeplock and
   never reads it; it is handed straight back. *)

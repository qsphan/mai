(* SpecReparent.v -- the public interface of reparent (the whole function),
   stated independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked
   in parallel.

     // Pass p's abandoned children to init.
     // Caller must hold wait_lock.
     void reparent(struct proc *p) {
       struct proc *pp;
       for (pp = proc; pp < &proc[NPROC]; pp++)
         if (pp->parent == p) { pp->parent = initproc; wakeup(initproc); }
     }

   WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY.

   * THE PARENT TABLE COMES IN AS CELLS, NOT AS A LOCK.  "Caller must hold
     wait_lock" is exactly the statement that reparent is handed
     [WaitInv.parents_own] -- the CONTENTS-OUT form -- rather than an [is_lock]
     it would have to acquire.  reparent takes no lock and its [cpu_own] level
     is therefore unchanged end to end; the caller's obligation to be holding
     wait_lock lives one altitude up, with kexit.

   * THE EFFECT IS THE PURE MAP [rp_map p ip].  Every cell equal to the
     argument becomes [initproc]; everything else is untouched.  That is the
     whole postcondition, and it is exact -- no existential over the resulting
     table.

   * [initproc] IS READ AT AN ARBITRARY FRACTION and handed straight back.
     This is the weakest premise that works, and the fraction is load-bearing
     rather than cosmetic: the [ld a0,0(s4)] sits INSIDE the loop and runs once
     per reparented child, so a contract that did not pin the global's value
     across the whole scan could not say that all the children got the SAME new
     parent.  Owning any fraction rules out a concurrent writer and pins it.

   * NOTHING IS SAID ABOUT wakeup's EFFECT, because wakeup has none that is
     visible: [SchedCtx.proc_pub] quantifies the state a SLEEPING->RUNNABLE
     move changes, so wakeup's own postcondition is empty and reparent inherits
     that silence.  [procs_inv] is persistent, so passing it costs nothing.

   * [b]-GENERIC, hence a [wp_next]: reparent CALLS wakeup, which may take a
     trap and resume the thread on a different hart.  A caller that holds
     wait_lock instantiates at [b = false] and the binder collapses. *)

     conduit for it.  Satisfiable at reparent's only call site: kexit enters
     holding wait_lock (rank 10) and "proc" is rank 11, so the caller's set is

     no lock of its own and wakeup's own contract is balanced -- so [lks] is
     unchanged end to end and this premise is not re-established anywhere. *)

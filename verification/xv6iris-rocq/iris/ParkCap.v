(* ParkCap.v -- THE PARK TOKEN: parking a fresh process, as a RESOURCE.

   WHY A RESOURCE.  Parking a process that has never run means building
   [SchedCtx.proc_ctx] for it -- a WP for everything that happens when the
   scheduler resumes it: forkret, userret, user mode, uservec, usertrap,
   the syscall dispatch, and inside that dispatch sys_fork -> kfork, which
   PARKS THE NEXT PROCESS.  So the theorem "a package of resources builds a
   [proc_ctx]" is used inside its own proof, one resumption deeper.  At the
   module level that is a cycle no functor application can tie (kfork's
   proof would have to be a functor over the park's proof, which is a
   functor over forkret's, which is a functor over the trap loop's, which
   contains kfork); it is why [LinkForkretPark.v] was an [Axiom].

   The knot is tied HERE instead, in the logic, where it belongs: the park
   is a persistent proposition [park_token γs] that a process HOLDS (inside
   its syscall environment, [ProofSyscall.syscall_env]) and hands to every
   child it forks, and that proposition is a GUARDED FIXPOINT -- the
   package a parker hands in is consumed under the [▷] of the context it
   builds, so the token it hands the child may itself sit under a [▷].
   kfork consumes the token as a resource and names no module;
   the only place the token is PROVED is at the top
   ([ProofForkretPark.park_token_intro]), from forkret's proof, and only
   main's cone ever refers to that.

   THE TWO HALVES of the token, for one residue [URB]:

     * THE CAP: the package plus the child's own rows build [▷ proc_ctx];
       the package is taken under a [▷] because the park's proof uses it
       only after the context's own later ([ProofForkretPark]'s [iNext]).
     * THE CHANNEL: the residue's producer-side entry
       ([UsertrapRes.ut_park_intro_body]) at [W := park_token γs] -- which
       is what makes the child's syscall environment carry a token too --
       under a [▷] for the same reason: the closer it yields is a package
       row, and the package is consumed under the later.

   Both occurrences of the token inside its own definition are under [▷],
   which is what makes the functional contractive. *)

         owed at it, so the two halves are one list named ONCE, here.  It

                        replace its address space first: forkret's boot arm
                        runs kexec("/init") between the park and the
                        resume, so no key captured at the park survives it
                        (userinit's park; completed/user-wp-slot.md SS4c,
                        refutation R-b).  What the parker hands over
                        instead is the EXEC BUNDLE that boot arm spends
                        ([InitBoot.init_boot_bundle], the row below), whose
                        slot piece answers at the key kexec builds -- so
                        the closer owes no slot on this mode and the kernel

                        arm is DEAD for this record and the resume is
                        forkret's steady arm, which lands on a record with

  (* THE STEADY PARK: one slot at the parked record, re-keyed at the resume.

     THE PREMISE IT ADDS is [FirstTok.first_done], which is what makes the
     shorter slot premise honest: the boot arm reads [first_addr] and its
     [↦₄ 1] is incompatible with the [↦₄□ 0] this resource carries, so the
     record this parks CANNOT be resumed through kexec("/init") and the only
     resume left is forkret's steady arm -- which lands on a record carrying
     the parked one's RUN KEY ([UexecRet.urun_eq]: the resume register file,
     the resume pc, the image, the permission view, the size and the cwd).
     Persistent, so a parker that has it (kfork's parent hands its child a
     copy) pays nothing for it.

     THE PREMISE IT REPLACES is the exec bundle.  [park_token_park] above
     demands [InitBoot.init_boot_bundle], because that park's resume runs
     kexec("/init") and the key comes out of it; this one demands ONE
     slot, at the parked record's own key, and the closer moves it onto
     the record the resume produces ([UexecRet.uslot_of_urun_eq]).  That is
     the shape a parent forking a VERIFIED program can pay: it has a
     continuation for its child at ONE record -- the trapframe it just
     copied with a0 := 0 -- and at no other.

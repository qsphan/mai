(* SpecYield.v -- the public interface of Yield, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   yield() gives up the CPU: from a normally-running kernel thread (no locks
   held, noff = 0, saved base enable [eb] ARBITRARY; this CPU's current
   process is proc j, the scheduler parked under ▷), it acquires
   p->lock, marks the process RUNNABLE, parks through sched(), and -- once
   some scheduler dispatches the process again -- releases the lock and
   returns.

   IT RETURNS ON THE HART THAT DISPATCHED IT, not necessarily the one it
   parked from (SpecSched.v): the continuation is quantified over that hart
   [h] and its SIE ghost [g], every resource comes back at [(h, g)], and the
   register fact is [callee_saved m mf] (tp-free) plus <the tp conjunct, now deleted: tp_pin makes it true by construction>
   (CalleeSaved.v).  ONE INDEX, NOT TWO.  [eb] (the saved base
   enable) and the resource index used to be separate binders; at level 0
   they are the same bit, forced by ghost agreement between [sie_arm]'s
   eighth and [intr_count 0 eb]'s ([CpuOwn.cpu_own_eb_agree]), so a second
   binder only ever admitted vacuous instances.

   [eb] IS NOT PINNED.  It used to be [true], which made this contract
   unusable from kerneltrap -- the trap cleared SIE, so the acquire inside
   yield records intena = 0 and the whole call runs at [eb = false].  Both
   of yield's callers in the C (usertrap and kerneltrap) reach it that way,
   on the timer path, with no [intr_on()] in between.

   WHICH IS WHY THE TRAP CSRs ARE A PREMISE.  sched's crossing demands the
   set unconditionally, and sepc/scause/stval are PER-HART registers, so a
   parking function cannot frame them -- it must hand them over and take the
   RESUMING hart's back.  At [eb = true] yield's own acquire produces them
   (dismantling the enabled SIE arm) and [trap_csrs_ext true = emp]; at
   [eb = false] there is no arm to dismantle and the caller brings them.

   THE RAW CONTEXT CELLS ARE NOT A PREMISE.  They live in p->lock, under
   the RUNNING arm of [SchedCtx.proc_slots], and yield reads them out of the
   lock it acquires -- the park receipt half it already carries refutes the
   lock's [not_running] arm, which is the proof that the state under the
   lock IS RUNNING ([SchedCtx.proc_slots_running]).  Demanding [own_ctx] up
   front would have made this contract unusable from kerneltrap, which
   PREEMPTED the thread and so cannot be holding the thread's own frames.

   THE CROSSING INDEX IS THE LITERAL [true], as for [sched]: a parking
   function migrates whatever the SIE state was, because a [swtch] moves the
   hart with interrupts off.  Threading [eb] there would have claimed, at
   [eb = false], that yield returns on the hart that called it.

   THE RESUMING HART'S INSTALLED-HANDLER RESOURCE COMES OUT INSIDE
   [trap_csrs_ext eb], and it is what makes this contract usable from a trap
   handler at all: the one thing a returning trap must still do is [sret],
   which flips SIE from '0' to '1' and therefore needs the handler resource in
   hand.  It is PER-HART, so a caller's own copy would be about the wrong hart
   the moment yield crosses a park; sched's dispatch payload carries the
   dispatching hart's, and it now rides inside the trap-CSR bundle that was
   already crossing.

   THAT USED TO BE A SEPARATE PREMISE, [intr_handler_avail_ext eb], with its
   own transport and its own forced-[emp] arm at [eb = true].  Both are gone:
   the resource is a conjunct of [trap_csrs], so the existing
   [trap_csrs_ext] carrier and [trap_csrs_ext_transport] serve it, and at
   [eb = true] it comes back inside the returned bundle's [sie_arm true] --
   where, being owned rather than behind an invariant, it can simply be read
   out.

   The context slot [C] stays ONE hart-independent proposition, carried out of
   the entry bundle and back into the exit bundle unchanged.  A hart-INDEXED
   slot [C : CPU -> iProp Σ] is not provable here and never could be: nothing
   in the crossing can turn [C cpu_id] into [C h], so such a spec would need a
   hart-transport bridge as an extra premise -- and a [C] that admits one is
   exactly a hart-independent [C].  (Every real instantiation is [emp]: a
   running thread's parked-scheduler obligation rides the separate
   [▷ sched_vc] premise, not the slot.) *)

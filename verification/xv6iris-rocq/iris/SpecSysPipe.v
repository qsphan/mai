   @ KernelSyms.sys_pipe = 0x80005338, 71 instructions (offsets 0x00 .. 0xe0;
   see CodeSysPipe.v for the listing).  A 64-byte frame: [fdarray] at
   s0-40, [rf] at s0-48, [wf] at s0-56, and the two [int]s sharing the
   bottom slot -- [fd1] in its LOW word (s0-64), [fd0] in its HIGH word
   (s0-60).

   WHY THIS ONE IS THE INTERESTING SYSCALL.  sys_pipe is the first proof in
   which every layer of the file/proc model is exercised at once and has to
   BALANCE:

     - it CREATES two file references (pipealloc) and INSTALLS them in
       descriptors (fdalloc), where sys_close only destroyed one;
     - it copies kernel data OUT to user memory, so it crosses the
       [proc_pt] altitude ([ProcInv.proc_priv_copy]) and the process's page
       table may GROW under it -- hence the [uptd_ext] descriptor in the
       continuation, exactly as for fetchaddr;
     - and it has FOUR exits over three error tails, each of which has to
       hand back the same resources.

   THE CONSERVATION LAW IS THE SPEC.  Two [fd_slot]s go in -- the
   per-syscall allowance of FdSlots.v, which is what the "+4" in
   [FDSLOTS] is for -- and two come back on EVERY exit.  Tracing them is
   the whole resource argument:

     | exit                  | where the two units end up                  |
     |-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
     | pipealloc failed      | both returned by pipealloc itself           |
     | fdalloc(rf) failed    | the two fileclose calls return them         |
     | fdalloc(wf) failed    | fdalloc(rf)'s unit pays to re-null ofile    |
     |                       | [fd0]; the two fileclose calls return two   |
     | copyout failed        | the two fdalloc units pay to re-null both   |
     |                       | descriptors; the two fileclose return two   |
     | success               | one per fdalloc, straight through           |

   If any one of those legs leaked, the [+4] allowance would drain and a
   whole-kernel proof could only run sys_pipe finitely often.  That is why
   [SpecFilealloc]'s failure arm and [SpecPipealloc]'s had to start
   returning their units before this spec could be written.

   DETERMINISM, AND ITS LIMIT.  Which descriptors get used is NOT a choice:
   they are the two least free ones, [SpecFdalloc.fd_frees]'s first two
   entries.  Which EXIT is taken, however, genuinely is not a function of
   anything the caller holds -- pipealloc can fail because another core just
   took the last ftable slot or the last page, and copyout can fail on a user
   address this altitude says nothing about -- so the postcondition is an
   honest disjunction there.

   WHAT THIS CONTRACT DOES NOT SAY, and why:

   * NOT WHICH BYTES LAND AT [fdarray].  The postcondition names the WINDOW
     precisely ([UserPtTree.umem_wr] at [v], length [d <= 8]) but leaves the
     bytes [bs] existential, so no resource here reads as "fdarray[0] =
     fd0" -- even though [SpecCopyout.wp_copyout_sconf_mem]'s own contract
     could support pinning [bs] to the little-endian encoding of [fd0] /
     [fd1].  That is a strictly stronger statement than any other syscall
     in this tree carries and is left to whoever wants it
     (SpecFilestat.v's note, on the same choice).
   * NOTHING ABOUT THE DESCRIPTORS' CONTENTS.  The two [file_ref]s land
     inside [proc_priv], and [ProcInv.ofile_slot] quantifies the [fcontent]
     existentially -- so the post can say descriptor [fd0] names ftable slot
     [k0], but not that [k0]'s type is FD_PIPE and its pipe is the same one
     [fd1] names.  Recovering that needs a PERSISTENT content witness on the
     ftable authority (an [agree] component in [FileInv.fileUR]), which is a
     change to the algebra and to all three of its proved ghost steps.

     BESIDE [proc_priv] -- three quarters of [p->pid] at once, when
     [ProcInv.proc_priv_core] owns one half and [SchedCtx.proc_pub], inside
     [p->lock]'s payload, owns the other.  A thread not holding [p->lock] can
     have one half and no more, and sys_pipe cannot be holding it (its own
     [cpu_own 0] says no lock is held, and everything below it sleeps).  So
     the premise set was unpayable, and nothing saw it: 3/4 <= 1, so the pair
     is a consistent proposition and no proof can refute it -- what refutes it
     is where the complementary half lives, which this function's proof never
     mentions.

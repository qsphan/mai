  (* WHAT THE COMMIT HOLDS AT A FREE INUM, and where each half is.  The
     pool's ORDINARY row is on its MARKER arm ([IcacheEscrow.ipool_shape_np]'s
     second alternative), which carries [InodeRegion.imark]; the region's
     slot for that inum therefore cannot be on its own marked arm
     ([InodeRegion.imark_excl]), so it is on the IN arm or the PENDING one --
     and BOTH hold the record fragment and the park.  That is the whole
     supplier: at a type-0 record the two are one [inode_owned_era].

     IT IS AN ACCESSOR AND NOT A MOVE, for this file's own reason: every
     conclusion the collection draws is PURE, so the slot goes back verbatim
     and the region invariant closes with the body it was opened with.  The
     [imark] is only READ (it refutes the marked arm) and comes straight
     back.

     THE SLOT, NOT THE INVARIANT: [InodeRegion.ireg_blks_acc_upd] and
     [ireg_slots_acc_upd] are what open [iregN] down to one slot, and they
     are the commit's business; this lemma is the last step, so [FsCollect]
     stays a LEAF and the [icEscN]/[ipoolN] side never enters its cone. *)
  (* A NESTED SECTION, and it costs the file nothing: [InodeRegion.ireg_slot]
     is stated over the ambient region configuration, so naming it needs
     [IcacheRefDefs.icfg] -- a class the outer section deliberately does not have
     (the arithmetic above is configuration-free).  A nested section puts the
     parameter on these two lemmas alone. *)

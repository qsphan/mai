(* LinkConsoleread.v -- consoleread's proof, instantiated against its
   callees'.

   It WAS an [Axiom] -- the single assumption the fileread cone rested on --
   because consoleread had no proof.  It has one now (ProofConsoleread.v), so
   this file is an ordinary functor application over the seven contracts
   consoleread actually calls, and [tools/proof_coverage.py] no longer reports
   an axiom here.

   What consoleread asks of a caller is unchanged by the proof:
   [ConsoleInv.is_conslock] and nothing else about the console -- see
   SpecConsoleread.v.  The ring's CONTENTS are still not promised, and that is
   a property of [ConsoleInv.cons_res] rather than of this link. *)

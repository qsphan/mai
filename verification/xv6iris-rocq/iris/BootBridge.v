(* BootBridge.v -- THE BOOT BRIDGE: the seam between the M-mode boot
   contract's postcondition and main()'s per-hart precondition.

   [SpecEntry.ENTRY.wp_entry_boot] runs the machine from reset
   (PC = 0x80000000, Machine mode, PMP all off) to <main> in SUPERVISOR
   mode, and hands back RAW cells: hart_state / cur_privilege / mstatus /
   satp / mideleg / mie / menvcfg / pmpcfg / pmpaddr, the register file
   [st_mout ...], and start()'s stack region as [stack_own_phys sp0 n].
   There is no ghost name, no [sconf], no capability.

   [SpecMain.MAIN.wp_main_boot_sconf] wants the sconf-TIER bundle:
   [sie_cap_gpr m (kv_frame_slots + K) false p0] +
   [cpu_own 0 false p0 cpu_ctx_free false] +
   the SIE ghost's spare quarter + [main_hart_raw tlbvec0].

   THE CONCLUSION'S avail INDEX NAMES THE RESERVE, and that is the honest
   number rather than an accident.  [boot_stack_slots K] is
   [2 + (kv_frame_slots + K)], so the carve the bridge physically takes off
   [sp0] IS [kv_frame_slots + K] slots -- and since the capability comes out
   at [b = false], whose reserve is nothing ([IntrDefs.trap_res_off]), all of
   it is [avail].  Holding the conclusion at [K] instead would be provable
   ONLY by discarding the deeper 78 slots, after which [main] could never
   fund a trap (see [IntrDefs.trap_res]: the handler's budget comes out of
   the interruptible caller's reserve).  Main's own budget premise is
   [K_main <= avail], which [lia] discharges at this index.

   [boot_bridge] below is exactly that conversion, and nothing else: it
   PLACES the three pieces of this hart's SIE ghost (1/2 tied in [sconf],
   1/4 handed straight through for main's [intr_inv_alloc_off], 1/4 split
   into the capability's and the push/pop counter's eighths -- the ghost
   NAME is now canonical per hart, [IntrDefs.sie_gname], and the three
   pieces are minted at adequacy rather than here),
   assembles [sconf] from entry's concrete
   post-state CSR values, folds the Bare translation slot
   ([sie_cap_intro_bare]), converts entry's PHYSICAL stack region to the
   VA tier the capability owns, and builds [cpu_own] out of the cpus[0]
   struct cells.  The MEMORY-IMAGE half of main's precondition
   (kernel_text / kernel_data / started_inv / the locks / the
   globals / the device tokens / the pages) is NOT this file's business.

   THE INPUTS THAT ARE NOT ENTRY'S POST.  Three groups, all of which the
   future system corollary sources from the memory image / the adequacy
   allocation, and which are therefore explicit hypotheses here:

     - [hw_config] and [minstret_inv]: persistent, and entry CONSUMES
       them inside [mmode_config] without handing them back
       ([mmode_config_persist] below is the one-liner that keeps a copy
       on the caller's side);
     - both halves of the Bare arm bit
       [strans_pending], the three pieces of this hart's SIE
       ghost at [sie_gname], the [tlb] cell and the three trap
       CSRs: minted by [RiscvAdequacy.riscv_system_adequacy].  The two
       GLOBAL boot tokens adequacy also mints -- [KptGhost.kpt_unset] and
       [KMap.kmap_auth kmap_M0] -- deliberately do NOT come through this
       file: they are global rather than per-hart and are spent inside
       kvminithart, so they travel BESIDE the bridge, straight into main's
       precondition.  Everything this file DOES thread is per-hart, which is
       what makes the bridge runnable on every hart at once;
     - the cpus[cid] struct cells ([a_cpu_noff] / [a_cpu_int] /
       [a_cpu_proc] / the 14 context words behind [cpu_ctx_free]): .bss, from
       the memory image.  [c->proc] arrives WHOLE and goes into [cpu_own].
       ([stvec] is NOT .bss -- it is a Sail register, and comes from the
       per-hart register set.)

   [pc_is] is NOT threaded: SpecEntry's post hands back [pc_is pcMain]
   with [pcMain := mword_of_int KernelSyms.main], which is literally the
   proposition SpecMain's precondition asks for, so the caller carries it
   across untouched.  (Keeping that symbol out of this file also keeps
   [tools/proof_coverage.py]'s textual entry-pc scan unambiguous.)

   THE CSR SIDE CONDITIONS.  [sconf] pins mstatus's fact set (with SIE
   UNPINNED but the ghost half tied to it), menvcfg = [MENVCFG_S], and
   mie ∧ ¬mideleg = 0; the Bare arm pins satp's Mode.  Entry's post gives
   those cells at values that are FUNCTIONS of the reset CSR values, so
   the bridge takes the five resulting facts as pure premises -- and
   [boot_csrs_reset] discharges all five at the power-on state
   (mstatus = SXL|UXL = 2, menvcfg / mie / mideleg / satp = 0) by
   computation.  Keeping them as premises rather than pinning the reset
   state inside the bridge is deliberate: SIE = 0 at <main> is NOT
   derivable from [SpecEntry]'s post (start() never writes SIE and
   [mmode_config] pins only MIE / MPRV / SXL), so the fact has to enter
   from the initial machine state, and the honest place to see that is
   the bridge's premise list. *)

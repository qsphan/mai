(* PieceFam.v -- THE ONE-SHOT PIECE'S FAMILY PAIR: a receipt beside a
   refund, in one record.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 0-4
   (the AU bundles), claude-notes/projects/app-echo.md ("REFUNDS, RULED").

   ==== WHAT A ONE-SHOT PIECE COSTS ITS CALLER =========================

   A syscall's caller-supplied input is a [∗] of independent ONE-SHOT
   pieces -- a commit, an undo leg, a slot wand.  Each piece is handed in
   as [AU ∧ R]: the caller proves the fupd and its REFUND [R] from the
   same context, the kernel eliminates to the fupd when it fires the piece
   and hands the whole conjunction back otherwise, so a caller that did
   not get its fire eliminates to [R] and recovers what it invested.  A
   FIRED piece returns its investment through the RECEIPT it chose
   instead, which is why the two travel together.

   [pfam Σ A] is that pair: [pf_recv] is the receipt family (its type [A]
   is the piece's own -- [aview -> Z -> anode -> iProp Σ] for an
   observation, [aview -> Z -> fname -> Z -> iProp Σ] for an entry write,
   [uvis -> iProp Σ] for exec's slot) and [pf_refund] is the refund.  The
   [∧] itself is spelled AT THE ASSEMBLY, once, as [pf_at] below: a bundle
   is a [∗] of [pf_at]s and every arm that returns a piece unfired returns
   the same [pf_at].  THE PIECE DEFINITIONS THEMSELVES ARE UNTOUCHED --
   they take a bare receipt family, which is what makes each of them still
   statable, satisfiable and pinnable on its own.

   ==== WHY A RECORD AND NOT TWO ARGUMENTS =============================

   One [R] per piece is the ruling, and the pieces are many: create fires
   five, sys_open six.  Spelled flat, [SYSOPEN]'s family list runs to
   fourteen and [CREATE]'s to twelve.  Paired, every list stays at the
   length it has today, the pairing is 1:1 with the pieces BY
   CONSTRUCTION (there is exactly one receipt family per piece in every
   syscall), and the TYPE says which families belong to a one-shot piece:
   a [pfam] is a piece's, a bare function is a CURSOR's.  The walk's
   [P]/[Pmiss] and the write chain's [Q] stay bare for precisely that
   reason -- a sequenced piece already carries its refund as its cursor
   and owes no second one.

   ==== THE TRIVIAL PAIR ===============================================

   A caller that answers for no abstract state hands every piece the
   trivial refund, and [pfam_triv Φ] is the pair that does: the caller's
   receipt beside [True].  The receipt stays explicit ON PURPOSE -- a
   class resolving the constant-[True] function structurally on the type
   was tried and refused: its arrow instance fires on an OPEN [A], so
   [iApply] against a goal whose family is still an evar guesses a type
   and then declines to unify (durable-notes, "A class used as an INDEX").
   Spelling the receipt costs one [fun _ _ => True%I] and has no
   elaboration failure mode.

   ==== REDUCING A LITERAL PAIR ========================================

   [cbn [pf_recv pf_refund]] is the house move for a goal holding a
   projection of a pair the proof just built ([pfam_triv Φ], [MkPfam S Rs],
   [FsAbsReadFire.arf_pin_fam]): a bare [/=] there is [simpl] over a
   syscall-altitude goal and overflows the stack rather than reducing the
   two fields.

   ==== THE TRANSPORT ==================================================

   [refund_mono] is what moves a piece under the conjunction: a mover
   stated on the AU side alone ([FsAbsCreateFire.acre_commit_at_gen_ext]
   is the one this file exists for) lifts to the pair because [iProp] is
   AFFINE -- [iSplit] hands the whole context to both conjuncts, so the
   refund branch may simply drop the mover. *)

(* [pf_at AU F] is the one-shot piece [AU] at the family [F], CONJOINED
   with [F]'s refund -- the [AU ∧ R] of the ruling, with the pair supplying
   both halves.  Every bundle is a [∗] of these and every arm that returns
   a piece unfired returns one; a fire opens it with [refund_au].

   [AU] is the piece with its receipt slot ABSTRACTED, which for every
   commit is simply the piece applied to all its other arguments
   ([pf_at (dlookup_commit_at Γ appE) Fex]) and for exec's slot wand -- whose
   payload is not its last argument -- a one-binder lambda.  Writing it this
   way is also what keeps a discharger's goal readable: [AU] determines the
   receipt type, so nothing needs a type ascription. *)

   [MISA_C] is the platform misa (S/C/U/M/A/I/D/F set, MXL=2); read-only, never
   written by the kernel.
   NOT A HAND-PICKED CONSTANT: it is what the model's own [reset_misa] writes,
   one bit per [hartSupports] answer, and [ColdBoot.cold_boot_misa] is the
   compiled proof of that -- so this literal cannot drift from the model without
   breaking the build.  It reads as it does because B and V are DISABLED in
   model-xv6iris/sail-config-rv64d.json (the config's header says why): the
   kernel is rv64gc and contains no B or V instruction, and with them enabled
   [DecodeSetU.decodable_u] would stop being the complete U-mode decode image.
   [MENVCFG_S] is the S-mode menvcfg AFTER the two M-mode
   boot writes ([start.c]: [menvcfg |= MENVCFG_ADUE] then, in [timerinit],
   [menvcfg |= MENVCFG_STCE]) legalize from the all-zero reset -- i.e. the ADUE
   bit (61) and the STCE bit (63) set, 0xA000000000000000.  The kernel never
   writes menvcfg again, so this value is constant throughout S-mode execution.
   Both are consistent with the bit-level facts pinned by [hw_config] /
   [smode_config] (which constrain PBMTE/PMM/LPE/FIOM -- none of them bit 61).
   ADUE=1 is Svadu: an access that needs an A/D update has the bit written back
   rather than page-faulting.  The kernel's page tables carry A/D preset, so no
   live walk ever needs an update (every walk lemma takes [update_PTE_Bits = None]
   and short-circuits before the ADUE gate), and the value of ADUE is invisible
   to them -- it matters only to the boot proof that produces this constant. *)

   ([IntrDefs.sconf]) then PINS, so the constant has to be nameable from
   both sides of the M->S bridge.

   this value only S-timer (5) and S-external (9) can ever be delivered --

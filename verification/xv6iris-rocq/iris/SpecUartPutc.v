     void uartputc_sync(int uid, int c) {
       struct uart *u = &uarts[uid];
       acquire(&u->tx_lock);
       while ((ReadReg(u, LSR) & LSR_TX_IDLE) == 0) ;
       WriteReg(u, THR, c);
       release(&u->tx_lock);
     }

   THE FUNCTION TAKES A PORT NOW (XV6_REV 163d39b), AND SO DOES THIS CONTRACT.
   xv6 drives two 16550s and this is the transmit path BOTH of them use:
   [consputc] calls it at uid 0 and [prputc] -- printk's and panic's one
   output primitive -- at uid 1.  So there is ONE contract, parametric in
   [i : uart_id], and everything the function touches is that port's:

     - the ARGUMENTS.  a0 is the index and a1 the byte (pre-bump the byte was
       a0).  The premise [m0 !!! a0 = mword_of_int (uart_index i)] is what
       ties the register to the port; the prologue turns it into
       `&uarts[uid].tx_lock` by `((uid*4 + uid) << 3) + 16 + uarts`, which is
       [UartsFields.uart_f_lock i] exactly when a0 is [uart_index i].

     - the LOCK is [UartTxInv.is_txlock_at i] -- the field
       `&uarts[uid].tx_lock`, under the name [uart_lock_name i] that
       `uartinit` initialised it with ("uart0"/"uart1"; the old single "uart"
       left `.rodata` with the old single lock).

     - the DEVICE premise is the BARE [uart_inv i] , not the [dev_inv]
       bundle: this function opens one port's invariant and nothing else, and
       at the second port the console bundle does not exist.  A console
       caller projects it with [WpUart.dev_inv_uart].

     - the MMIO ADDRESS IS LOADED, NOT COMPUTED.  `ld a3,0(s4)` reads
       `uarts[uid].base` out of `.data` and both the LSR poll and the THR
       store address off that register, so the proof has to know what the
       word HOLDS.  [base] is written by the loader and by nobody else, so
       the resource is a PERSISTENT word snapshot: [uart_base_word i] below.

   WHY [uart_base_word] AND NOT [UartsFields.uarts_pinned].  They are the
   same fact at different TIERS.  [uart_base_pinned] is the RAW PHYSICAL word
   the boot carve produces; an S-mode load leaf consumes the tier
   [uart_base_word] is spelled in, and the crossing between them is BOOT's,
   not a driver's -- see the note on [uart_base_word] below for what the boot
   chain still owes.

   THERE IS NO PANIC PATH.  printk.c's [panicking]/[panicked] globals are
   deleted, and with them the guarded [push_off]/[pop_off] pair and the
   [if (panicked) for(;;)] spin.  What replaces them is a plain critical
   section: uartputc_sync takes the port's [tx_lock] -- a SPINLOCK -- around
   its poll/store pair, which is what makes it agree with uartwrite (the other
   transmit path) instead of racing it.  So the contract carries no flag
   cells, no [eq_vec]/[neq_vec] refutation premises, and, being a spinlock
   caller, the ordinary [cpu_own] accounting of any function that acquires and
   releases.

   WHAT THE CALLER NO LONGER OWNS.  [UartTxInv.tx_res] is the LOCK's resource,
   so the exclusive transmitter token comes out of the acquire and goes back
   on the release: it is neither a premise nor a postcondition here.  All the
   caller brings is the persistent credential [UartTxInv.is_txlock_at i],
   which bundles the lock with the frozen-DLAB fact [uart_dlab_off] the THR
   store needs -- hence no separate [uart_dlab_off] premise either.

   WHAT THE CALLER BRINGS, AND WHAT IT GETS BACK (lane OUT-FUPD).  The
   sublist receipt is GONE.  Instead the caller supplies the JUSTIFICATION
   for the byte this call puts on the wire -- [WpUart.out_chain i [sb] Φ],
   one link, because uartputc_sync stores exactly once -- and gets back the
   link's payload [Φ].  That is the owner's redesign made literal at the
   first writer above the store: "all UART output needs a fupd to justify
   outputting", and this contract is where the fupd enters the driver.

   WHY A CHAIN OF ONE AND NOT A BARE [out_link].  So that every writer above
   -- consputc, uartwrite, consolewrite -- states the SAME thing over the
   run of bytes it pushes, and [WpUart.out_chain_app] is the only bridge
   any of them needs.  At one byte the two are convertible.

   ONE CONTRACT AT BOTH PORTS.  At [Uart1] -- printk's and panic's path --
   [WpUart.out_ok_at] is [True], so [WpUart.out_chain_triv] builds the chain
   out of [Φ] itself and the caller owes nothing: the owner's ruling that
   the kernel's own UART is unconstrained costs this contract not one
   binder.  See [SpecPrputc.v]. *)

(* uartputc_sync's own frame is EIGHT slots ([c.addi16sp sp,-64] at +0x00),
   and its only callees are acquire and release, which want 10 below it.

   IT WAS 14, OVER A FOUR-SLOT FRAME.  The port index costs three more
   callee-saved registers (s3 = uid, s4 = &uarts[uid], s5 = the byte, on top
   of s1 = &u->tx_lock and s2 = uid*4), so the frame doubled -- 32 to 64
   bytes -- and this bound grew with it.  There is no slack in it: it is the
   frame plus the deeper of the two callees. *)

     S-mode load leaf ([WpSconfMem.wp_ld_s_sconf]) wants the tier spelled
     here, and the physical-to-VA direction is not a law
     ([DiskInv.phys_win_to_mem] lands at the RAW VA byte and DROPS the
     ledger, which is the half a context-tier re-entry needs).  The boot
     chain already has the right idiom for a word nobody ever writes -- the
     `_entry` GOT slot, where [BootShared] mints [TsoCtx.pristine_win]
     BESIDE [boot_ran_phys_word] -- so `uarts[i].base` wants the same pair,
     or a persistent [↦₈□] sibling of [BootCarve.boot_ran_ran_word] minted

     without the others.  And these are the only CONTEXT-RELATIVE facts the
     interrupt path needs about the array -- everything else it carries
     about a port (that port's invariant, its PLIC slot's one-shot, its

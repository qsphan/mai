(* TsoCtxRehearsal.v -- THE CUTOVER REHEARSAL.

   ANSWERED BY [TsoCtxTwin2.v]: every finding below is either encoded in
   the corrected construction (the honest mints, the interp-free
   transports, the dq axis) or shown to be an artefact of the old twin's
   global-map shape (the two refutations -- see the successor's header
   and §12).  Kept as the discovery record; do not extend.

   [TsoCtxTwin.v] showed that a TSO-shaped context machinery EXISTS over
   [TsoMem.v]'s Ztso view machine.  It was written before leg M swept the
   context axis through the tree, so it models only load/store/transport/
   park/resume.  This file asks the question the sweep makes urgent:

     ARE THE STATEMENTS [TsoCtx.v] ACTUALLY EXPORTS -- the ones ~600 files
     now depend on -- SATISFIABLE AT THE TSO DEFINITIONS?

   It is a DISCOVERY file.  A negative result is a result: where a surface
   statement is refutable at the twin, the refutation is PROVED here (as a
   Coq-level [... -> False]) rather than worked around, and the honest
   replacement statement is proved beside it.  Nothing here is admitted and
   nothing here is axiomatised; where a repair is a genuine design question
   rather than a proof obligation, it is left OUT of the file and reported.

   THE HEADLINE RESULTS.

   1. [own_context_alloc : |==> ∃ ξ, own_context ξ] IS REFUTABLE
      ([no_own_context_alloc]).  So is a free allocation of a PARKED token
      ([no_ctx_parked_alloc]) -- for the same structural reason: in the twin
      BOTH tokens are fragments of authorities that live inside
      [tso_interp].  The honest interp-carrying mints are [twin_ctx_mint]
      (a running token, for boot) and [twin_ctx_birth] (a parked token, for
      fork).  Section [roster] then shows what an interp-FREE mint needs to
      be true: an identity carrying ITS OWN gname (which the real
      [CtxIdDefs.CtxId] does and the twin's [nat] does not).

   2. [CtxMorph]'s pointsto instance IS REFUTABLE ([no_ctx_morph_pointsto]):
      the class has a bare [==∗], and re-registering a byte at another
      context consumes the LEDGER AUTHORITY.  [CtxMorphI] is the honest
      shape (interp threaded), and all five structural instances survive it
      verbatim.

   3. THE SWTCH EXCHANGE IS DERIVABLE, not primitive
      ([twin_swtch_exchange]): park-then-resume DOES compose on one hart,
      because park deletes h from [run] and resume asks only for
      [run !! h = None].  Its premise is [T ≤ tvs h]; the kernel-side form
      [twin_swtch_exchange_at_top] shows THIS HART AT THE LOG TOP suffices
      -- exactly the AMO-acquire evidence that also mints [ctx_dom].

   4. THE FORK STAMP.  [twin_ctx_birth] stamps the child at the CURRENT LOG
      TOP and [twin_deposit_at_fork] then hands the parent's byte facts to
      the child WITH NO VIEW SIDE CONDITION -- the acid test the owner
      asked for, passed.  What it still needs is the LEDGER AUTHORITY, i.e.
      the interp; see the note above [twin_deposit_at_fork].

  (* [TsoCtx.own_context_alloc] says a running-thread token may be
     conjured from nothing.  At the twin [own_context ξ h] is [h ↪[γrun] ξ]
     -- a full-fraction ghost-map element AT THE KEY [h].  Two of them at
     one hart are contradictory, and the surface's law supplies two.

     THE HART IS WHAT KILLS IT: the existential is over ξ, not over h, so
     the two mints collide even though they name different contexts.  Read
     the statement as: you cannot conjure "I am running as some fresh
     thread ON THIS HART" out of nothing. *)

  (* THE PROPOSED REPLACEMENT -- a free allocation of a PARKED

     DIFFERENT: [ctx_parked ξ T] is [ξ ↪[γpark] T], whose key IS the
     existential, so two mints do not collide.  What kills it is that the
     [γpark] AUTHORITY lives inside [tso_interp]: hold that authority at a
     map which does not mention ξ, and the conjured fragment contradicts
     it.  Stated against the bare authority, so it depends on no invariant
     clause -- ANY holder of the park authority refutes the law. *)

  (* THE HONEST RUNNING MINT (this is BOOT's rule: adequacy CONSTRUCTS the
     interp, so it may hold it).  It consumes the [γrun] authority and
     carries exactly the three side conditions the invariant needs:
       - [run !! h = None]           the hart is not already running something;
       - [∀ h0, run !! h0 ≠ Some ξ]  RUN-INJECTIVITY;
       - [parked !! ξ = None]        PARKED-NOT-RUNNING.
     Note what is NOT needed: nothing about the log, the views or the
     ledger.  A newborn context owns no bytes, so the SEES invariant has no
     obligation for it -- which is why a mint needs no view evidence. *)

     takes the interp.  The rules below take the interp, and stamp at the

  (* THE ACID TEST, PASSED.  The parent hands a byte fact registered at ξp
     to a child stamped at the log top, and there is NO VIEW SIDE
     CONDITION: the child's park token at [length log] IS the domination
     evidence, and the SEES obligation for the re-registered entry is
     discharged by [twf_bound] alone ([t ≤ length log = T]).  Nothing about
     the parent's hart, the child's future hart, or any view is needed.

     WHAT IS STILL NEEDED, AND IT IS THE FINDING: the LEDGER AUTHORITY.
     Re-registering [a] from ξp to ξc deletes one ledger entry and inserts
     another, so this step -- like every transport -- runs with the interp
     open.  An interp-free fork MINT therefore buys nothing on its own: the
     deposit that follows it needs the interp anyway.

     WHAT IS ALSO STILL NEEDED, AND IT IS THE SECOND FINDING: the stamp is
     only good for facts the parent holds AT THE STAMP.  A byte the parent
     writes AFTER the fork gets a ledger timestamp [t > length log_at_fork]
     and no longer satisfies [t ≤ T], so it cannot be deposited.  If xv6's
     fork copies the address space after building the child's record, the
     child's stamp must be taken at the END of fork, or raised when facts
     are added. *)

(** * 2.  What an interp-FREE mint needs to be true                    *)
(* ================================================================== *)

(* [no_own_context_alloc] and [no_ctx_parked_alloc] both fail for one
   structural reason: in the twin a context identity is a bare [nat], so
   EVERY claim about it is a fragment of some GLOBAL authority, and no
   fragment of a fixed-gname authority is allocatable from nothing.

   The real surface does not have that problem: [CtxIdDefs.CtxId] is
   [MkCtxId (γ : gname)] -- the identity CARRIES ITS OWN GHOST NAME.  This
   section shows that with such an identity an interp-free allocation works
   exactly as ruled:

     - allocating a never-yet-run identity is a PURE ghost step, no interp
       ([ctx_unstarted_alloc]);
     - and the token is not vacuous: the interp holding one HALF per live
       context ([roster]) turns the freshly allocated whole into precisely
       the freshness side conditions [twin_ctx_mint] / [twin_ctx_birth] ask
       for ([roster_fresh]), which are otherwise unobtainable.

   The unit payload is deliberate: the token's content IS its identity. *)
Section roster.
  Context {Σ : gFunctors} `{!ghost_varG Σ ()}.

  (* An identity that carries its own name. *)
  Notation CtxG := gname (only parsing).

  (* "ξ exists and has never been enrolled anywhere." *)
  Definition ctx_unstarted (ξ : CtxG) : iProp Σ := ghost_var_frac ξ 1 ().
  (* the interp's half, one per live (running or parked) context *)
  Definition ctx_live (ξ : CtxG) : iProp Σ := ghost_var_frac ξ (1/2) ().
  Definition roster (S : gset CtxG) : iProp Σ :=
    ([∗ set] ξ ∈ S, ctx_live ξ)%I.

  (* (1) FREE ALLOCATION -- no interp, no authority, no premise.  This is
     the shape a fork mint wants: fork creates an identity, and the child
     does not get [own_context] yet. *)

  Proof using .
    iMod (ghost_var_alloc ()) as (γ) "H". iModIntro. by iExists γ.
  Qed.

  (* (2) AND IT CARRIES FRESHNESS.  This is the half that makes the free
     mint usable: without it, a freely allocated identity could collide
     with a live one and the mint's RUN-INJECTIVITY / PARKED-NOT-RUNNING
     premises would be unobtainable. *)
  Lemma roster_fresh (S : gset CtxG) (ξ : CtxG) :
    roster S -∗ ctx_unstarted ξ -∗ ⌜ξ ∉ S⌝.
  Proof using .

    iDestruct (ghost_var_valid_2 with "Hξ Hhalf") as %[Hv _].
    exfalso. by apply (Qp.not_add_le_l 1 (1/2)).
  Qed.

  (* (3) ENROLMENT: the mint keeps a half as its own witness and hands the
     other half to the roster, which is how the roster stays a faithful
     index of the live contexts. *)
  Lemma roster_enroll (S : gset CtxG) (ξ : CtxG) :
    roster S -∗ ctx_unstarted ξ ==∗ roster ({[ξ]} ∪ S) ∗ ctx_live ξ.
  Proof using .
    iIntros "HS Hξ".
    iDestruct (roster_fresh with "HS Hξ") as %Hnin.
    rewrite /ctx_unstarted /ctx_live.
    iEval (rewrite -{1}(Qp.div_2 1)) in "Hξ".
    iDestruct "Hξ" as "[H1 H2]".

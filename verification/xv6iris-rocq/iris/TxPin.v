(* TxPin.v -- THE TRANSACTION PIN, one vocabulary for the eight parks.

   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-ghost-state.md, "the pin inventory".

   Eight places in the file system park the SAME atom -- a positive share of
   an open transaction's [LogDefs.ln_tx] element -- so that a commit, which
   holds that map's authority EMPTY, can refute the state outright:

     * [IcacheEscrow]'s [ic_dep_side] (the write arm's descriptor),
       [ic_out_frz]'s last conjunct (iput's +0x5e..+0x70 freeze window),
       [ic_pin_tx] (the slot pin at [ic_held] and at the frozen payload),
       [ipool_transit] (the pool's in-transit ledger) and [crp_row]'s
       [CrpPre] (the corpse ledger);
     * [InodeRegion]'s [ireg_fpin] (the f column's freeze window),
       [ireg_cpin] (the c column's claim box) and [ireg_parked] (the armed
       registry).

   WHAT DOES *NOT* UNIFY, and the reason this file holds three combinators
   rather than one indexed predicate: the eight parks do not share a KEY and
   cannot share an AUTHORITY.  Three of them are keyed by an icache SLOT, one
   by a fresh ARM ID and four by an INUM -- and even at the inum, two pins
   stand at one key at one moment (create's [ProofCreateFreshTy] holds the
   child's [DepTx] share and the claim box's [ireg_cpin] together;
   [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] returns [ireg_fpin] and the transit
   ledger's share in one postcondition; iput's +0x70..+0x8a window has the
   slot pin and the f column up at once).  A single-valued per-inum ghost map
   cannot hold two pins at one key, and a multi-valued one would re-create
   the RE-IDENTIFICATION problem the seven existing devices already solve
   ([IcacheRef.hpn_h], [ic_deposit], [iclaim], [ifreeze_pre]/[ifreeze_post],
   [ipool_tkey], [EscrowDefs.crp_elem], [ireg_armed]).  So the pin unifies
   and the devices stay: what every park has in common is the ATOM, and what
   every refutation has in common is [tx_pin_no_ops].

   GAMMA-PARAMETRIC, NEVER [icfg_log]-AMBIENT (durable-notes, "NAMING AN
   AMBIENT CLASS FIELD OUTSIDE ITS CLASS'S SCOPE IS A MEMORY BOMB").  This
   file is a pure leaf with no [icfg] in scope; naming [icfg_log] here would
   send typeclass search after [fileG Σ] with [Σ] unknown.  The ambient
   readings are spelled [tx_pin icfg_log ...] inside the files that already
   bind [ICFG].

   AND NOT [Typeclasses Opaque] (durable-notes, the seal trap).  Seven
   [Timeless] instances downstream ([ireg_fsh], [ireg_cpin], [ic_dep_side],
   [crp_row], [ipool_transit], [ireg_parked], [ic_pin_tx]) are one-line
   [apply _] / [tl_struct]; a seal makes [ghost_map_elem]'s own instance
   unreachable and every one of them breaks.  [SpecIunlockput.ic_dep_side_of_tx]
   also states a LEIBNIZ equality between propositions discharged by
   [reflexivity], which a seal would not survive either.  The three instances
   below are stated explicitly so no consumer has to unfold.

   [LogInv.log_tx_full] / [log_tx_open] are NOT restated here: their
   conclusion names [LogInv.log_tx], which lives above this leaf.  Because
   [tx_pin] is transparent they apply to a [tx_pin γ t 1] by conversion. *)

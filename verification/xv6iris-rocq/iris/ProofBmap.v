   THE SHAPE OF THE PROOF.  Five live arms and a dead panic, joining at the
   shared epilogue +0x8a.  Four lemmas, entered strictly left to right:

     [bm_epilogue]      +0x8a .. +0x98   the join: a0 := s1, pop the frame,
                                         ret, and discharge the contract.
     [bm_release]       +0x82 .. +0x88   brelse, restore s4, fall into the
                                         epilogue.  THREE of the five arms
                                         end here (indirect hit, indirect
                                         data-balloc failure, indirect
                                         data-balloc success).
     [bm_indirect_tail] +0x62 .. +0x80   bread, read a[bn], and the
                                         allocate-and-log block +0x9a..+0xb0.
     [wp_bmap_sconf]    +0x00 .. +0x60   prologue, the direct arm, and the
                                         indirect head.

   THE s4 QUIRK is what fixes that division.  gcc pushes s4 only on the
   paths that reach bread ([c.sdsp s4,0(sp)] at +0x058 / +0x060) and pops it
   once at +0x088; the direct arm jumps to +0x08a having never touched it.
   So [bm_epilogue] is reached with s4 ALREADY equal to its entry value on
   every arm -- restored on the indirect ones, never written on the direct
   ones -- and its premise is exactly that ([bm_thr5], which covers s4),
   plus frame slot 6 held as an ANONYMOUS word ([bm_frame]).  Only the
   interior lemmas, where s4 really is live, carry the weaker [bm_thr6].

   THE PANIC ARM AT +0x0b2 IS DEAD: [bltu a5,a4] at +0x044 compares 255
   against bn-NDIRECT, and the contract's [fbn < MAXFILE] bounds that by
   255, so the branch always falls through.  Refuted, not proved.

   THE COUPLING THAT MAKES THE INDIRECT ARM WORK is [bm_held_content]: the
   caller's own [fs_chalf] half for the indirect block (inside [inode_map]'s
   [ind_res]) against the bio handle's machinery half pins the buffer's
   bytes to [ind_bytes (bm_ent bm)] -- so the word the code reads out of
   [bp->data + 4*(bn-12)] IS entry [bn-12] of the pure entry list.

   FRESHNESS.  Each of the three installs has to re-establish
   [blkmap_wf]'s injectivity, and the ONLY thing that can is balloc's
   exclusive byte run against the runs inside [inode_map] /
   [inode_blocks] ([InodeInv.inode_fresh]); [fs_chalf] is a half element and
   two at one key are consistent.  That is also why bmap takes
   [inode_blocks]: the fresh DATA block's half is deposited there. *)

  (* THE TWO ALLOCATION-ONLY CALLEES, as propositions.  Verbatim the types
     of [BALLOC.wp_balloc_sconf] / [LOG_WRITE.wp_log_write_sconf]; passing
     them as hypotheses instead of functor arguments is what keeps the
     no-alloc instance free of the balloc assumption. *)
  (* NB the GenId / CpuId binders are written EXPLICIT here.  An implicit
     binder inside a Definition's BODY is silently ignored by Coq ("Ignoring
     implicit binder declaration in unexpected position"), and a hypothesis
     of a Pi type gets no implicit-argument metadata anyway, so a call site
     passes them as [_ _].  That is not a loss: an evar whose type is a class
     is still filled by typeclass resolution -- with the most recently
     introduced CpuId, which is exactly what an implicit-instance argument
     would have picked, and is why every call site transports [cpu_own] to
     the current hart first. *)

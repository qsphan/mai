(* UartAccepted.v -- THE SAFETY TIE between the observable trace and the
   ACCEPTED-BYTE HISTORY the console specs are stated over.

   [ObsTrace.v] proves the trace's SHAPE a step invariant of the semantics
   and ties the current cycle's output projection to the device's [u_wire]
   ([obs_wf]'s third conjunct).  This file adds the other half of the
   sentence a console spec needs, in the direction the owner ruled for
   [claude-notes/completed/uart-trace.md] -- SAFETY, "no unaccepted byte
   ever appears":

     every [ObsUartOut] byte of the current power cycle is a byte the
     kernel ACCEPTED into the UART, in order, and nothing else is there:

       obs_wire (open_seg h)  `sublist_of`  uart_acc (duart (gdev g))

   [uart_acc] ([DevModel.v]) is precisely the object the campaign's
   receipts are lower bounds of: [WpUart.uart_sent γ tr] is
   [own _ (◯ML tr)] against [uart_sent_auth γ u = own _ (●ML (uart_acc u))],
   and the retired located receipt was a refinement of the
   same list.  So this theorem is what turns a receipt about [uart_acc]
   into a statement about what the HOST SAW -- see [run_out_accepted_from]
   at the end, which is that composition at the pure level.

   WHY IT IS A SUBLIST AND NOT A PREFIX.  A byte accepted into the transmit
   FIFO reaches the wire on the device thread's own later step, and under
   LOOP ([uart_loopback], MCR bit 4) it never reaches the wire at all -- it
   goes back into this UART's own receiver with SOUT held marking.  An FCR
   write can also CLEAR the transmit FIFO, dropping bytes that were accepted
   and never sent.  So the wire is a SUBLIST of the accepted history, and
   the invariant that carries this is stated one step below, on the device:

       out_wire_ok u  :=  u_wire u `sublist_of` u_out u

   ([u_out] is what the transmitter has finished with; [uart_acc = u_out ++
   u_tx], so [u_out] is a prefix of it).  That form is what survives an FCR
   clear, which shortens [u_tx] and touches neither of these two.

   WHY THERE IS NO LEDGER HERE.  The trace ledger's per-event wands
   ([WpUart.uart_obs_permit_ledger]) are quantified over an ARBITRARY
   [γ : uart_names] and an ARBITRARY [u : uart_state], so a client's [R]
   can learn nothing about the era's acceptance at an event that it did not
   already know; the acceptance content of the trace is a PURE step
   invariant of the language, and that is where it belongs -- exactly as
   [obs_wf] is.  What the ledger is needed for is an ERA-ATTACHED fact (a
   receipt at a particular [γ]), and that waits on uart-trace.md's open
   "identification gate".  See the header of [run_out_accepted_from].

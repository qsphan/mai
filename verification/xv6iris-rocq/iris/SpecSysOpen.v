   @ KernelSyms.sys_open, 342 bytes (CodeSysOpen.v).  A TWENTY-FOUR slot
   frame ([addi sp,sp,-192] at +0x00, [addi s0,sp,192] at +0x06), carved --
   numbering slots from the top, [pa_stk sp0 n] = sp0 - 8n:

     slot  1  (s0-8)    ra
     slot  2  (s0-16)   s0, the frame pointer (= the ENTRY sp)
     slot  3  (s0-24)   s1 = ip  -- saved LATE, at +0x28
     slot  4  (s0-32)   s2 = f   -- saved LATER, at +0x5e
     slot  5  (s0-40)   s3 = fd  -- saved LATER STILL, at +0x68
     slot  6  (s0-48)   dead
     slots 7..22        [char path[MAXPATH]] -- [addi a1,s0,-176]
     slot 23            [int omode] in its UPPER word, [s0-180]
     slot 24            dead (the frame's bottom)

   THE THREE REGISTER SAVES ARE SHRINK-WRAPPED, AND THAT MAKES THE FRAME
   CARVE ARM-DEPENDENT -- unlike sys_chdir's and sys_link's, where one
   [*_frame_join] serves every exit.  The prologue pushes only ra and s0;
   [c.sdsp s1,168] is at +0x28, AFTER the [argstr < 0] branch, [sd s2,160]
   at +0x5e after the T_DEVICE test, [sd s3,152] at +0x68 after filealloc
   succeeded.  The epilogue at +0xca restores only ra/s0, and every arm
   reloads exactly the subset it saved (+0xd8/+0x10a/+0x116 reload s1;
   +0x12e reloads s1+s2; +0x126 reloads s3 then falls into +0x12e; the
   success tail +0xc4 reloads all three).  ARM 0 never owns slot 5 at all.
   Nothing about [path] reaches this contract: it is carved out of
   [stack_own] with [StackBytes.slotsn_bytes_own].

   ==== ONE CONTRACT ====================================================

   [Module Type SYSOPEN] is sys_open's only seal.  Its body is the
   whole-function FRAME below plus ONE caller INPUT ([open_in]) and ONE
   armed OUTPUT ([open_arms]), BOTH KEYED THE WAY THE CODE KEYS: on
   [SysOpenDefs.om_create vom], the O_CREATE bit of the caller's own
   omode argument, which the machine tests with the [andi a5,a5,512] /
   [c.beqz] pair at +0x36.  On the [false] side the input is
   [SysOpenDefs.open_au_plain_at] and the output [open_arms_plain]; on the
   [true] side [open_au_create_at] and [open_arms_create].  The two arm
   families are stated below in full.

   ...AND BOTH ARE AT THE PATH THE CALLER PASSED.  sys_open [argstr]s
   trapframe argument 0, so every piece of this contract that mentions a
   path mentions THAT one: the input is the bundle at whatever string the
   process's image holds at the argument-0 pointer
   ([ArgPath.arg_path_of (us_M U) v pl], the guard
   [SpecSysExec.sys_exec_au_pre] states exec's walk piece under), the
   success arms and the receipt bind [pl] together with that same reading,
   and the failure fold carries the whole uninstantiated wand back on its
   first disjunct -- the arm argstr's own failure lands in, where no [pl]
   satisfies the reading at all.  A caller that knows its own image
   therefore hands in ONE path's worth of walk, which is what a PINNED
   cursor is, and reads back WHICH file it opened.

   THE LANDED RETURN BLANKET [sys_open_post] IS A CONSEQUENCE, not a
   conjunct ([open_arms_landed], via [open_arms_plain_landed] /
   [open_arms_create_landed]).  It could not be a conjunct: unlike
   sys_write's blanket, which is a pure [Prop], [sys_open_post] CARRIES
   [proc_priv], the descriptor-state bundle and [fd_slot], and every arm
   already carries those -- conjoining it would demand them twice.

   THE TWO ARM STATEMENTS, [wp_sys_open_plain_body] and
   [wp_sys_open_create_body], are the one body at a DECIDED key: each takes
   [om_create vom = false] / [= true] as a premise and is otherwise
   [wp_sys_open_body] with the [if] reduced.  They are not sealed, not
   client-facing, and each has exactly ONE proof (ProofSysOpen.v's plain
   walk, ProofSysOpenFull.v's create walk); the seal's own lemma is the
   three-line [destruct] over them.  So there is one proof per arm and one
   contract for the syscall.

   ==== WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IN =======================================

   [SysOpenDefs]'s two bundles -- see that file's header for the walk
   premise's era shape, the two commits, and the ONE delta the no-O_CREATE
   surface has (O_TRUNC's).  THE TRUNC PIECE RIDES [om_trunc vom]
   ([SysOpenDefs.open_trunc_piece]), the second key this contract is stated
   at: an open without O_TRUNC owes it nothing and gets nothing back for
   it, because the code does not truncate.  The caller's predicates are the walk cursor
   [P]/[Pmiss], create's child legs [Farm]/[Fun], create's two receipts
   [Fok]/[Fex], the terminal observation [Fo] and the trunc receipt [Ft];
   the plain side ignores the create four, which is what its bundle and
   arms say by not mentioning them.

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT =====================================

   sys_open is the tree's FIRST WRITER of [f->ip] and [f->off], and the only
   syscall that PUBLISHES a file payload out of an inode reference.  Two
   facts about that, because they are what the walk is:

   * THE [+1] INODE REFERENCE NEVER LEAVES.  create / namei hand back a
     reference, and instead of an [iput] the walk PARKS it in [f->ip] with
     [FileInvDefs.inode_pay_alloc]: the shed reference, the generation it
     names and that generation's [ity_shot] become the FD_INODE payload at
     fraction one.  That is the same ledger sentence as sys_chdir's
     [p->cwd], one descriptor further along -- which is why the success arm
     ends one iref unit short and the allowance below is spend-at-most
     rather than conserved.
   * THE WRITABLE-FD-IS-NOT-A-DIRECTORY WITNESS IS THE THEOREM OF THIS
     WALK.  [inode_pay_alloc] demands [wr = true -> ty <> T_DIR], and both
     arms discharge it FROM THE CODE: the O_CREATE arm passes T_FILE (and
     create's ok arm reports [di_type dn ∈ {T_FILE, T_DEVICE}]), while the
     else arm's test at +0xf6 forces [omode = O_RDONLY = 0] on any T_DIR
     inode, whence [f->writable = (omode & 1) || (omode & 3) = 0].  This is
     where filewrite's [DirView.dir_ok] obligation -- five frames up -- is
     actually paid.  In the arms below it holds BY THE DIR ARM'S OWN KEY
     ([om_rdonly_modes]).

   THE [major] BOUNDS CHECK IS ONE UNSIGNED TEST, NOT TWO.  The C is
   [ip->major < 0 || ip->major >= NDEV]; gcc emitted [lhu] + [bltu 9 <u a4].
   A negative [short] zero-extends to [>= 0x8000 > 9], so the single
   unsigned compare decides both disjuncts and the walk has ONE branch to
   price, not a short-circuit pair.  [NDEV_max = NDEV - 1 = 9] is the
   landed spelling (ConsoleInv).

   ==== THE ARMS ========================================================

   ret = fd (the least free descriptor, [fd_frees]'s head, a0 = its
   zero-extension) -- PLAIN side, keyed by the observed [anode]:
     DEVICE  the row is [ADev ma mi], [0 <= ma <= NDEV_max] ASSERTED,
             fragment typed [FdDevice ma], the trunc piece refunded (which
             is nothing at all unless the caller passed O_TRUNC).
     FILE    the row is [AFile bs0]; fragment [FdInode i]; the trunc
             receipt iff [om_trunc vom], and [emp] otherwise -- nothing
             was owed, so nothing comes back.
     DIR     ONLY at [om_arg vom = 0] -- the C compares the WHOLE omode
             int against O_RDONLY, not a bit -- so the fragment is
             [FdOpen true false (FdInode i)].
   ret = fd, CREATE side: FRESH (the fused delta fired at the entry write;
   [cre_pre] restated purely; the terminal observation refunded and the
   TRUNC receipt delivered at the empty child iff O_TRUNC -- see
   [open_post_ok_create]) or EXISTS-OPENS
   (the exists observation fired, then the terminal observation on the
   FOUND node -- an [AFile] or [ADev] split, never [ADir], per F-OK).
   ret = -1 -- residue returned per arm; the value does not say which arm
   fired (DETERMINISM: none is claimed and none is available):
     (i)   nothing fs-visible happened (argstr failed): the whole bundle
           comes back unspent;
     (ii)  the walk died at hop [k]: the era refund shape, both/all
           commits back;
     (iii) the walk completed and open failed past it.  PLAIN: the
           observation HAS fired (every post-walk failure -- the
           dir-with-write-mode test, the bad major, the two table-full
           arms -- sits inside the child's lock window, so the fire point
           always exists) and its receipt is delivered; the trunc commit
           back.  CREATE: three-way -- (a) create SUCCEEDED FRESH and open
           failed past it (table full): the delta STANDS and [Fok] is
           delivered -- the fs mutation of a failed open is real and this
           spec says so; (b) the name existed: [Fex] delivered (found DIR
           = ARM F-BAD, found DEVICE with a bad major, or table full past
           a good found node), the terminal observation fired OR refunded
           (the F-BAD instant is inside create, where forcing the fire
           would charge the create-AU carry; mknod's precedent);
           (c) nothing observed (the nlink guard, out of inodes, dirlink
           failure, the empty-final-name path "/"): everything back.

   The success arms additionally TYPE the new descriptor's row --
   [FdOpen rb wb (FdDevice ma)] on the device arm, [FdOpen rb wb
   (FdInode i γo OffParked)] on the file/dir/create arms -- where the blanket leaves
   the type existential; [proc_priv_settle]'s payout IS the typed row.

   ==== THE REFERENCE LEDGER, AND WHY IT IS THREE ======================

   [create_slots] -- three, create's own -- goes in, and at most three come
   out spent.  The O_CREATE arm IS create, so its allowance is create's
   verbatim; the else arm's namei takes two and hands one back, and the
   third pays for the reference that ends up in [f->ip].  Every failure arm
   releases what it made ([iunlockput(ip)]), and the success arm keeps
   exactly one -- parked, as above.

   ==== THE LOG LEDGER CLOSES AT THREE, AND THE FLOOR IS THE WALK =======

   begin_op mints [LogInv.log_op g MAXOPBLOCKS] = ten units and end_op
   retires whatever is left, so nothing log-shaped crosses this interface.
   The whole ledger (machine-checked in [SysOpenBudget.v]) turns on what the
   two entry arms leave AT THE JOIN: the else arm leaves nine, and the
   O_CREATE arm can offer only [SpecCreate]'s [ok = true] FLOOR, which is
   [iput_units] = three -- exactly what each of ARMs D/E/F spends on its
   [iunlockput].  Without S6-mkdir's floor the create arm reaches the join
   with a bare [u' <= u] whose corner is zero: the floor is not a
   convenience for this walk, it is the walk ([so_create_nofloor_busts]).
   The COUNTED namei contract busts it at [L = 3] and leaves one where the
   join needs three ([so_counted_namei_busts]), so the SET form is forced
   here for sys_chdir's reason at a longer tail.

   The O_TRUNC tail is payable out of create's three with no credit, because
   [it_entry false u = S (S u)]: freeing a file's blocks costs two, every
   [bfree] hitting the one bitmap block and the tail flush the one inode
   block ([so_trunc_closes]).  sys_open could not supply a credit in any
   case -- create's post reports [Sb ⊆ Sb'] and never a membership.

   ==== THE FILE-TABLE LEDGER: ONE UNIT IN, ONE UNIT OUT ===============

   One [fd_slot] is the syscall's allowance.  filealloc CONSUMES it (the new
   reference has to live somewhere); fdalloc hands one back when it installs
   the descriptor (the descriptor's own unit); filealloc's failure arm hands
   it straight back, and ARM F-FAIL's [fileclose] hands it back after
   fdalloc refused.  So every one of the eight arms returns exactly one.

   ARM F-FAIL's extra [fileclose(f)] IS FREE, and that is
   [SpecFileclose.fileclose_env_none]'s doing: the file it closes is still
   FD_NONE ([SpecFilealloc]'s post pins the type), and fileclose's
   environment at FD_NONE is [emp].  pipealloc's reason, reused -- which is
   why no [fclose_names] and no closing environment appear below.

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   [eb = true] is create's and namei's premise, inherited verbatim.  The
   [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded anyway, and is
   [emp] there.

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function sleeps in create, in
   namei, in ilock, in itrunc, in begin_op and in end_op, so it may return
   on a hart other than the one it was called on.

   THE BITMAP IS AN INVARIANT ([BitmapInv.bitmap_inv], inside [fs_ready]):
   create's dirlink can ALLOCATE and both the failure arms' iunlockputs and
   the O_TRUNC tail can FREE, and the contract says nothing about either.

   THE IMAGE DOES NOT MOVE.  This syscall only READS user memory (argstr,
   through fetchstr and copyinstr); the pages it faults in on the way were
   already in the block's view, as lazy pages reading 0, so vmfault does not
   move it either.  Only the DESCRIPTOR grows, and the block comes back at
   the image it was handed -- which is why the continuation's binders are
   [(mf, ns', P')] and the page-table report is the SIZED one
   ([uptd_ext_sz]).

   ==== NOTHING ABOUT DURABILITY =======================================

   No durable clause of any kind appears below (design/fs-syscall-specs.md
   section 5).  NO STABLE COROLLARY is sealed either: the era/[_at] stable
   story is a dedicated follow-on, and the agreement seeds
   ([SysOpenDefs]'s [_pinned] lemmas) are its raw material.

   BINDERS: one instance path per scope -- [fileG] is bound and
   [icacheG]/[icfg] resolve only through its fields (the SpecCreate
   header's argument, inherited); the FsAbs carriers resolve their
   [fsTopG]/[fsLinkG] through [xv6G]'s fields; [GenId] is bound because the
   arms carry [proc_priv].  The live Γ is [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L fsc_fs];
   its gname tie to [ftop_body]'s authority is definitional
   ([FsAbs.ftop_gamma_top]). *)

  (* WHAT THE "name existed" FAILURE ARM HANDS BACK, which has TWO
     producers and they differ in whether the permit has been paid.
     create's own failure fold reaches this arm with create having
     returned 0 (a found DIRECTORY, say): the permit was never paid, so
     the caller's piece is whole and BOTH child legs come home.
     sys_open's own later failure past a good found node reaches it with
     the permit paid: the piece is keyed at that node, the arm's half went
     into the permit and rides the keyed piece's refund
     ([SysOpenDefs.cre_ft_kept]), and only the unarm comes home beside it.
     The two travel together because the piece and the legs are what the
     permit was paid WITH.  At [om_trunc vom = false] this is exactly the
     child-leg disjunct every arm always carried. *)

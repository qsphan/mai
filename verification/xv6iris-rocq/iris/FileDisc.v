(* FileDisc.v -- THE FILE APPLICATION'S PURE MODEL: the lines the user may
   type ([echo w1 .. wn], [echo w1 .. wn > f], [cat f]), the file state each
   round leaves behind, and the console transcript the session calls for.
   Iris-free, over [EchoDisc]/[LineWords]/[FileState], so the claim can be
   read -- and refuted -- without opening the logic.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-file.md section 1; the state
   vocabulary ([fstate], [echo_chunks], [sel_ok], [subseq]) is [FileState.v],
   which the claim reads too.

   WHAT THIS FILE IS.  [EchoDisc] models a session in which every round is
   one echo line and the only state is the console's.  Here a round is one
   of THREE line shapes and carries a second state -- the file [f] -- which
   SURVIVES the round, the era and the power cycle.  So the session
   function threads it: [sessf ps cs s0 I] is [EchoDisc.sess] with the
   per-round block computed at the state the previous rounds left
   ([fstate_upto]), and [file_phi] is the whole-history claim, one boot state
   per cycle, each admissible for what earlier cycles typed.

   THE OBSERVER STILL CANNOT SEE THE FILE, and does not need to.  Two
   resolutions that print the same bytes may leave different files
   ([RFOpenU] against [RFOpenM]), and two different files may print the
   same bytes ([RCRan] at an absent f against [RCNoOpen]).  So the
   determinacy theorem [sessf_prefix_det] -- the twin of
   [EchoOutPure.sess_prefix_det], which is what the stage spends --
   concludes an equality of BYTES and never of states or indices.  Its
   engine is one observation, not a table: EVERY alternative's own output
   is either sh's panic line "fork\n" or a '$'-free run followed by the
   prompt, and no content, no line and no diagnostic carries a '$'.  So two
   alternatives below one wire agree by [fd_dollar_split], whatever they
   are, and only the panic alternative -- which re-enters init's prologue
   instead of printing a prompt -- needs an argument of its own.

   WHERE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM design section 1, each departure reported
   in claude-notes/projects/app-file.md under Findings:

   - [parse_line] inverts [line_body] (the body [LineWords.bodies_of]
     cuts), NOT [line_bytes] (which carries the closing newline the cut has
     already stripped): [parse_line (line_bytes l) = Some l] is false at
     every [l], e.g. [parse_line (line_bytes LCat) = parse_line (sb "cat
     f\n") = None].  [line_bytes l = line_body l ++ [wl_nl]] is kept.
   - the partial line of a disciplined input is [fbody_byte], which admits
     '>' beside [LineWords.wl_body_byte]'s alphanumerics and blank -- the
     user typing [echo hi > f] is mid-line at [echo hi >], and the old
     predicate refutes that byte.
   - [fsm]'s [RFOpenM] keeps design section 1's guard "only at an absent
     f": at a PRESENT f xv6's [sys_open] truncates only after [filealloc]
     has succeeded (kernel/sysfile.c), so at [Some bs] this alternative
     leaves the file alone and is [RFOpenU].
   - [good_out_f] takes no [Ls]: the admissible-boot condition is
     [file_phi]'s own conjunct and nothing in the per-cycle claim reads it.
   - [file_phi]'s "the first cycle boots absent" is stated as a GUARDED
     clause: [forall s, s0s !! 0 = Some s -> s = None].  The design's
     [s0s !! 0 = Some None] is refuted at the empty history, where
     [cycles_of [] = []] forces [length s0s = 0]. *)

   WHY THE CONSTRUCTOR IS HERE AND NOT IN A SIBLING TYPE.
   [UkSh.ush_line_at] -- the sh loop's line fact, which every era shares --
   reads exactly three projections of [uline] ([uline_ok], [line_bytes]
   and, through [ush_rest_line_at], [uline_ws]), so an era whose lines are
   not [uline]s cannot use the loop at all.  [parse_line] is UNTOUCHED, so
   it never answers [LPipe] ([parse_line_not_pipe]), [lines_of]'s range is
   exactly the three it was, and every FILE statement quantified over
   [disc_input_f] means what it meant.  The price is the guard
   [uline_nopipe] on the three round-trip lemmas below, which say that the

(* THE THEOREM'S CONCLUSION.  The file persists, so the statement is over
   the whole history, cycle by cycle, with each era's boot state chosen
   inside the admissible set -- and the FIRST era's boot state absent,
   because the mkfs image has no [f].

   THE FIRST CLAUSE IS GUARDED.  [cycles_of [] = []], so an unguarded
   [s0s !! 0 = Some ∅] would make [file_phi []] false while
   [disc_f []] holds; the guarded form says the same thing at every
   history that has a cycle. *)

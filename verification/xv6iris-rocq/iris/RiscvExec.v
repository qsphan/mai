  (* THE SINGLE PER-HART FRAMING POINT, now per NODE of the Sail monad
     instead of per whole instruction.  Everything else about it is
     unchanged from the whole-instruction rule it replaces: it takes the
     thread's [gen_cert] and cases four ways on the current [(ggen, gpow)].
     LIVE (power on, generation current): the registry element ties the
     ambient era to [state_interp]'s existential, and the caller's callback
     sees exactly [mstate_interp] -- ONE HART'S VIEW, the same currency the
     whole-instruction rule handed over, which is why the leaves' σ-callbacks
     keep their shape.  DEAD (generation passed): tail into [wp_dead].
     Current-but-off: refuted by the STARTED certificate.  Unborn: refuted
     by the birth certificate.

     THE CALLER OWES, at the node [m]:
       - a WITNESS successor, i.e. that the node is not stuck; and
       - the continuation at EVERY successor the node admits.
     The ∀ is what the semantic delta costs: a node with a nondeterministic
     arm (an MMIO read is deterministic, a RAM read is not -- the value is
     pinned only by what the caller owns) hands the continuation whatever the
     machine chose.  Callers that step a DETERMINISTIC node discharge the ∀
     from a determinism fact, exactly as the old rule discharged
     [wp_lift_step]'s "forall next-state" obligation from [exec_run_det].

     THE RESERVATION CONTEXT (design §3a) is ∀-quantified: [oth] is what the
     other harts have reserved, [r] this hart's own reservation.  Neither is
     tracked by [state_interp] yet, so the caller learns nothing about them
     and owes a witness and a continuation for EVERY value -- which is
     exactly enough: a register node ignores them; a RAM write or an
     exclusive read whose footprint meets [oth] SELF-LOOPS, and the memory
     rules absorb that arm by Löb.  Only the conditional-write rule needs to
     KNOW [r] (to learn the RMW's old value), and that is the rule that will
     hand [state_interp] the [resv_frag]/[resv_ok] pair. *)
  (* THE RESERVATION-AGNOSTIC FORM.  Usable exactly by the rules whose arms
     never touch the hart's reservation -- register nodes, announces, plain
     and MMIO READS -- because writing back the value already there is a
     no-op on the mirror's auth ([RiscvPtsto.resv_map_insert_id]).  Every arm
     that CHANGES it (any RAM/MMIO write, the exclusive read, the [Ret]
     boundary) needs [wp_hart_step_resv] below instead: a [ghost_map] auth
     cannot be updated without its fragment. *)
  (* THE MEMORY-MODEL CONTEXT (tso-machine-flip.md §6 amendment A6.1) rides
     beside the reservation context and is ∀-quantified the same way: [img]
     is the era image, [log] the write log, [V] the per-agent view function
     and [tv] THIS hart's entry of it (handed over separately so a leaf can
     name its own view without projecting [V]).  The callback gets the
     ghosts as [tso_interp_of] -- the gstate-free bundle -- and owes it back
     at the node's [log'] and at [vstep], the view function after this
     hart's move.  A leaf that touches no memory returns it unchanged modulo
     [vstep]'s no-op ([tso_interp_of_ext]); the load/store/barrier leaves are
     where the four ghost steps live. *)
  (* THE READ SIDE (relaxed-rr.md §4): the callback also receives this
     hart's [hread] as a pure value with its bound, and the read-watermark
     counter on loan beside the instruction-view counter; it owes the
     counter back at the node's [hr'].  The coherence floors ride in the
     pure value only -- nothing owns them. *)

  (* THE ONE RULE WHOSE STEP IS OBSERVED (RiscvLang §3b', claude-notes/
     completed/uart-trace.md): the tx/rx arms emit the console I/O events, so
     this rule hands its callback [state_interp]'s half of the HISTORY ghost
     at the history so far -- together with the two facts about it the
     callback can use, that the power is on ([trace_shape h true]) and the
     WIRE TIE (the outputs of the open cycle are exactly the device's
     [u_wire]) -- and takes it back at [h ++ κ].  The client can only get
     there with the OTHER half, which lives in its trace predicate
     ([obs_inv]): that is how every observation is authorised by the client
     ([WpUart.uart_obs_permit]).  A client that states no trace property
     moves the ghost and ignores [κ]. *)

     exactly [obs_boots h = S gen_id]: the history the callback is handed
     belongs to THIS generation's era, and the number of that era is
     readable from the history alone.  It is what lets every application
     fact stated about a history be tied to the era's indexed claim
     ([RiscvPtsto.riscv_cons_res]'s ERA INDEX paragraph) without any

  (* THE ONE RULE THAT HANDS THE IMAGE CONJUNCT OVER (crash.md): a DMA
     completion is the only step in the whole machine that moves [v_disk], so
     the disk thread -- and nobody else -- receives the AMBIENT ERA's image
     auth together with its tie to the device's image, and owes the same shape
     back at the post-state's image.  Stated in the RAW ∃-form rather than as
     [disk_dur_interp], because the callback is per-[dev_state], not per
     [gstate] -- the two are the same resource
     ([disk_dur_interp riscv_eraGS g = disk_img_auth disk_img_name
     (v_disk (dvirtio (gdev g)))]). *)
  Lemma wp_disk_step :
    gen_cert -∗
    (* THE STARTED-GENERATIONS AUTH IS THREADED THROUGH TOO (phase C2b/D1),
       in the same accessor style as the image auth: a DMA completion is the
       one step whose client fupd has to know WHICH generation is current,
       and [state_interp] is the only thing that does.  The pure [n = gen + 1]
       is the live-era arithmetic ([start_count] at [gpow = true]); together
       they let the crash-side arm's [gen_started] be bounded from above. *)
    (* THE TSO BUNDLE IS THREADED THROUGH TOO (tso-machine-flip.md §6
       amendment A6.2).  The disk is an AGENT of the log: a DMA-writing step
       appends its whole write set [W] as ONE authored message, so the four
       ghost steps a hart's store owes ([Wobl_ram]) are owed here as well --
       and they cannot be done by this rule, because the per-byte timestamp
       FRAGMENTS for [W]'s addresses ride inside the CLIENT's own
       [ctx_pointsto]s.  So the authority is handed to the callback exactly
       as the image auth already is, and the callback owes it back at the
       appended log.  The disk's own VIEW half is free: [avf] pins every
       bus-master agent to the top, so [vstep disk_agent (length log') log']
       is the whole move.
       THE WRITE SET COMES OUT OF [disk_step] ITSELF (§6 amendment A6.11),
       so the callback KNOWS which [W] it owes timestamps for -- and an arm
       that writes nothing says [W = ∅], which is what lets four of the six
       arms hand the bundle straight back.  Before A6.11 [W] was a separate
       existential tied only by [W ∪ m = m'], and this rule was unprovable
       downstream: every arm, [DiskStepIdle] included, admitted a non-empty
       [W] of already-correct bytes and hence an unpayable append. *)

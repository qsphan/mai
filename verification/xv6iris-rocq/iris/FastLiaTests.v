     that hypothesis and fails the test here rather than hanging a proof in the

     every nat inequality and the fallback hid it. *)

     bisect around.  Here [Hnoise : P x] is a non-arithmetic Prop, so it is
     doomed -- but [r : R Hnoise] is not a Prop, so it stays and still names it.
     A [clear] that took the whole doomed list at once fails; what must happen
     is that the rest still goes and the solve still closes. *)

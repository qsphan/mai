(*  FsReady.v -- THE RUNTIME FILE SYSTEM, AS ONE PERSISTENT ASSERTION,
    AND THE SEAL THAT MAKES IT EXIST.  (SIMP-2, second half;
    claude-notes/design/ghost-simplification.md §5.2 and §5.3a;
    claude-notes/design/fs-ghost-state.md §7.)

    ---- WHAT IS HERE ----------------------------------------------------

    [fs_ready] began as [FsSyscalls.fs_world] rehomed.  Three things are
    true of it now that were not true of that assertion:

      1. IT HAS ITS OWN LEAF FILE, below the syscall layer -- and, since the
         [ic_sleeplocks] hoist, below the whole Spec layer.  Any file that
         wants the fs environment can import the predicate without
         importing the syscall bodies that used to own it.

      2. IT HAS A PRODUCER.  [fs_world] never had one: it was, in its own
         header's words, an assertion "a friendly client pays for once, at
         boot", with satisfiability unchecked (upstream's [syscall_env] is
         in the same position).  [fs_ready_seal] and [fs_ready_establish]
         below are that producer's two halves: the boot-shelter token
         [ireg_boot] that fsinit hands back DIES into the persistent sealed
         regime [ireg_open], and the remaining seventeen constituents --
         every one of which fsinit's own caller already holds -- complete
         the predicate in one [bupd].

      2b. IT IS THE WHOLE PRECONDITION, NOT JUST THE RESOURCE HALF.  Beside
         the invariants it carries the image's own ARITHMETIC
         ([fs_geom_ok], §0 -- the nineteen pure premises every
         file-system syscall used to state one by one) and the four
         SUPERBLOCK CELLS the fs cone reads ([fs_sb_cells], §0b, at
         [DfracDiscarded] because nothing writes them after fsinit).
         Those were the last two things a syscall contract had to thread
         beside this predicate, and threading them is what made "the file
         system is ready" a claim a caller could hold and still not be
         able to call anything.

      3. IT IS BOOT-FREE, AND THE TYPE ENFORCES IT.  Not one conjunct
         mentions boot state.  [ireg_boot] is EXCLUSIVE and is consumed by
         the seal, so the instant [fs_ready] exists, booting is over: there
         is nothing boot-shaped left to mention, and no continuation that
         carries [fs_ready] can be asked about the boot chain again.  This
         is why fsinit and ireclaim -- which run PRE-seal -- keep their
         constituent forms and must not take [fs_ready]: they hold
         [ireg_inv] without [ireg_open], and the predicate they cannot form
         is exactly the predicate whose existence says they are done.

    ---- IT TAKES NO PARAMETERS, AND THAT IS THE POINT -------------------

    [fs_ready] is meant to be CARRIED: produced by forkret's not-forked
    arm, held by a running process, handed to the trap loop, read back by
    every later syscall.  A twenty-parameter version can be carried only by
    existentially quantifying the twenty, and a bare existential is useless
    downstream -- a consumer handed [∃ γ…, fs_ready γ…] cannot feed it to
    [KexecDefs.fs_fabric] or [UsertrapRes.ut_res_bare], whose own resources
    are keyed to the CALLER's concrete names, because nothing relates the
    two.  Ambient names remove the existential instead of hiding it.

    So every name is ambient: the four the inode cache already owned
    ([icfg_log], [icfg_ist], [icfg_nib], [icfg_dev]) and the eighteen
    [FsCfg.fscfg] adds.  That is [IcacheRefDefs.icfg]'s own argument one layer
    out -- there is exactly one file system per boot -- and [fscfg] is
    per-era exactly as [icfg] is (the disk image ghost is re-minted at
    PowerOn; design/crash.md), i.e. a Class ASSUMPTION each era's boot
    instantiates rather than a global constant.

    [procs_inv] IS NOT A CONJUNCT.  It is a PROCESS resource, it is
    persistent, every consumer holds it beside this predicate anyway
    ([KexecDefs.fs_fabric] lists it separately), and it was the only
    conjunct that reached back into the process layer -- which is what made
    the file system LOOK as though it depended on process abstractions.  A
    spec that wants it takes [procs_inv γs] as its own premise.

    [FsSyscalls.fs_world] IS GONE (rank 1d).  It was this predicate AT A
    CALLER'S OWN NAMES -- the tie equations ([bn = fsc_bio],
    [γd = fsc_disk], …) beside the ambient [fs_ready] -- and rank 1 took
    every one of those names off the fs contract surface, so both sides of
    every equation print the same and the wrapper had nothing left to say.
    A caller that threads its own [pd]/[pav]/[pu] -- the ONE part of the
    fabric [fscfg] cannot hold (its ruling R1) -- uses [fs_ready_disk] to
    unpack this predicate's witness and [disk_geom_agree] to identify the
    two; everything else it wants is a projection below.

    ---- WHY IT MATTERS: THE FORKRET DELTA ----

    [LinkForkretNF.v]'s header states the problem this file exists to
    solve.  forkret's not-forked arm calls fsinit and kexec, and forkret
    holds the fs environment "only INSIDE the residue closer ... If the
    arm's proof needs those resources up front, this contract grows a
    premise."  Growing it by the CONSTITUENTS is fifteen-plus rows with
    the boot/regime story unresolved at that altitude.  Growing it by
    [fs_ready] is ONE row, and a persistent one: everything the arm's
    continuation can want is recovered by the projection family below,
    which is an [iDestruct] one-liner because the family lives INSIDE this
    file's section.

    ---- THE SECTION, AND THE CLASS-USED-AS-INDEX TRAP ----

    THIS IS LOAD-BEARING.  [FsSyscalls]'s own section names [fileG] but NOT
    [icfg] or [icacheG]; [fileG] carries both as superclass FIELDS
    ([FileInvDefs.file_icfg], [FileInvDefs.file_icacheG]), so every
    icache-flavoured conjunct is elaborated at the BAKED projections rather
    than at a binder.  A foreign section with its own [ICFG : icfg]
    therefore cannot frame those conjuncts against its own re-typed copies
    -- which is what made the projection family unprobeable outside this
    file.

    So this section declares [icacheG] and [icfg] EXPLICITLY and declares
    them LAST, so that resolution prefers them over [fileG]'s fields:
    [fs_ready] is parametric in the cache's INDEX (though not in its
    names), and every projection below is stated at that same index, so a
    consumer elaborating at [file_icfg]/[file_icacheG] meets it on the
    nose.  [fscfg] rides in on [fileG] beside [icfg] (see the note on
    [FileInvDefs.fileG] for why it is a class field rather than a binder of
    its own), so this section binds it nowhere and there is exactly one
    instance path to its fields.  *)

     at the ambient names, as one record.

     They belong here for exactly the reason the resources do.  "The file
     system is ready to operate" is not only a pile of invariants: it is
     also the arithmetic mkfs's image satisfies -- the log's region is
     covered, the bitmap block is covered and outside the log, every inum
     the region can name has its block covered, the inode count fits a
     [ushort].  A contract that took the resources from [fs_ready] and the
     arithmetic from nineteen separate premises would still make every
     caller re-derive facts about a file system it was just handed; and the
     facts are about the AMBIENT configuration, so there is exactly one
     copy of them to have.

     FOUR OF [FsSyscalls.fs_geom]'s FIELDS ARE GONE, not dropped: [fg_dev],
     [fg_nib], [fg_log] and [fg_ist] tied a threaded name to the [icfg]
     class, and a predicate stated AT [icfg] has nothing left to tie.  A
     contract that still threads its own names discharges them by
     [reflexivity] once it instantiates at the ambient ones.  Four more
     ([fg_size], [fg_bm_nn], [fg_bm_cov], [fg_bm_out]) are literally
     [bitmap_geom_ok]'s conjuncts and are reached through it -- see the

     Every fs contract in the tree takes these as [↦₄{dq}] at a threaded
     fraction, and every one of them only ever READS: [readsb] fills the
     global `sb` once, inside fsinit, and nothing in the kernel writes it
     again.  A fraction is therefore an accounting cost with no
     corresponding permission -- it forces four cells through every
     contract, every bundle and every continuation on the way, for a value
     that is fixed for the lifetime of the boot.

     Discarding the fraction at the end of fsinit ([ctx_word4_pointsto_persist])
     retires that cost outright: the cells become persistent, they live here
     beside the invariants they describe, and [DfracDiscarded] instantiates
     the [dq] of every existing contract without any of them changing.  This
     is the one place the file system's geometry appears twice -- once as the

     [icfg_dev]) and the eighteen [FsCfg.fscfg] adds.  That file's header
     carries the argument; the short version is that a carried predicate
     must not be an existential, because an existential cannot be fed to a

     PERSISTENT, and that is the theorem about hiding: the syscall seals
     CONSUME all eighteen and return NONE of them, and that is sound

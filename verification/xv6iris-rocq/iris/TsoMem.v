(** * TsoMem.v — the minimal view machine (leg T spike), RELAXED FOR R→R

    The memory model of record: a global append-only write log plus a
    small per-hart state.  Born as the Ztso machine of the TSO port
    ([claude-notes/completed/tso-cutover-endgame.md]) with ONE monotone
    log index per hart; relaxed for load–load reordering per
    [claude-notes/projects/relaxed-rr.md], which adds two per-hart pieces
    and deletes one assignment.  It is still the deliberate simplification
    of the `weak-memory` branch's promise-free RVWMO machine (per-byte
    coherence map, five scalar views, a forward bank): a total store order
    and R→W order are KEPT, so only the reader's freedom is modelled.

    THE MACHINE.  State = era-initial image + `glog : list wmsg` (each
    message carries its author) + per hart: a FLOOR `tv : nat`, a READ
    WATERMARK `rv : nat`, and a per-byte COHERENCE FLOOR `coh : Z → nat`.

      - A message at log position `i` has TIMESTAMP `S i`; timestamp 0 is
        the era-initial image.  The log order IS the total store order.
      - VISIBILITY: hart `h` at view `tv'` sees timestamp `t` iff `t ≤ tv'`
        or the message at `t` is h's own.  Own messages being always
        visible is store-buffer FORWARDING; it is load-bearing (a store
        must NOT advance the author's view — that would forbid SB).
      - LOAD of byte `a`: choose any `tv'` with `tv ≤ tv'`, `coh a ≤ tv'`
        and `tv' ≤ length glog`, and read the LATEST visible write at
        `tv'`.  THE FLOOR DOES NOT MOVE (under Ztso it moved to `tv'`,
        which is the whole of load–load order); `rv := max rv tv'` and
        `coh a := tv'`.  Two loads may thus read at views in either order
        — MP and IRIW without fences are allowed — while a second load of
        the SAME byte reads at or above the first (CoRR, RVWMO ppo rule 2).
      - STORE: append at the top; nothing per-hart moves.
      - FENCE: a W→R edge (`pw ∧ sr`) DRAINS — the floor passes the hart's
        own last message (drains happen in log order, so everything below
        it has drained too); an R→R edge (`pr ∧ sr`) ACQUIRES — the floor
        passes the read watermark, so every later load sees at least what
        every earlier load saw.  `fence rw,rw` does both.  Fences with a
        W-only successor (`rw,w`, `r,w`, `w,w`) are no-ops: W→W order is
        the single log and R→W order is the interleaving.
      - EXCLUSIVE/AMO read: read at `tv' = length glog` — the globally
        latest value ("drain, then read memory") — and raise `rv` to the
        top.  The write half of an `.aq` AMO appends and takes the FLOOR
        past its own append; a PLAIN exclusive pair (no `.aq`) moves no
        floor at all — the Svadu A/D write-back's LR/SC is one, the lock
        leaves' `amoswap.aq` is the other kind.  Sail carries the acquire
        strength on the READ kind; `RiscvLang.hr_acq` carries it to the
        paired write.  Atomicity — no foreign write lands between the two
        halves — is the LANGUAGE's obligation, exactly the reservation
        self-loop arms in `RiscvLang.mnode_step`.
      - NOT MODELLED: RVWMO's syntactic address/data/control dependency
        order (ppo 9–13).  A load whose address came from an earlier load
        may still read at a lower view; the MP+addr litmus records this as
        ALLOWED on purpose (relaxed-rr.md §5).

    Devices (the disk's DMA) are just agents: an agent index, a view, the
    same rules.  Crash/power: the log is per-era and dies with RAM at a
    power edge; that is the language layer's era machinery, not this file's.

    DELIBERATELY DEPENDENCY-FREE: stdpp only, no Iris, no Sail.  Addresses
    are [Z], bytes [bv 8], agents [nat]; the real machine instantiates at
    [Arch.pa]/[CPU].  Beware the [gmap Arch.pa _] Countable trap (durable
    notes): the era image is a partial FUNCTION on [Z], not a [gmap], so
    the eventual Sail-side seam is a definition, not a [kmap]. *)

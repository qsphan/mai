(* BarePt.v -- THE PARKED USER TABLE, AT ANY STAGE OF ITS TEARDOWN.

   [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt] describes a LIVE process page table: the trampoline
   leaf, the trapframe leaf, the user map, everything else blocked.  The
   teardown path needs more shapes than that.  proc_freepagetable drops the
   two fixed leaves, ONE AT A TIME, before calling uvmfree:

     proc_freepagetable(pagetable, sz) {
       uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAMPOLINE, 1, 0);
       uvmunmap(pagetable, TRAPFRAME,  1, 0);
       uvmfree(pagetable, sz);
     }

   and it HAS to: freewalk panics on any leaf it meets, so a table with the
   trampoline still mapped cannot be torn down at all.  So uvmfree runs on
   a BARE table -- the user map and nothing else.

   ONE AXIS: THE FIXED-LEAF MAP ITSELF.  Bare and live differ in exactly
   which FIXED leaves the table carries, so this file makes that map the
   parameter:

     [fx : gmap (mword 27) (mword 64)]     the leaves the PROCESS does not own

   [uptg_map fx um] is the whole leaf map ([fx] wins over [um]) and
   [uptg fx uroot um] the parked table.  [proc_pt] is the [upt_fixed_both]
   instance ([proc_pt_uptg]) and [bare_pt] the [∅] one.

   WHY A MAP AND NOT AN [option (mword 44)].  The first version of this file
   had a two-point axis -- [Some tfp] = both fixed leaves, [None] = neither.
   That is one state short.  proc_freepagetable passes THROUGH
   "trampoline gone, trapframe still there", and proc_pagetable's second
   mappages failure tail STARTS in "trampoline mapped, trapframe never was":

     if (mappages(.., TRAPFRAME, ..) < 0) { uvmunmap(pt, TRAMPOLINE, 1, 0); .. }

   Neither is expressible as an [option], so neither function could be
   stated at all, let alone proved.  A map covers every stage uniformly and
   makes "drop one fixed leaf" a plain [delete].

   WHAT THE AXIS BUYS.  uvmunmap's proof touches the fixed leaves in exactly
   one way: it must know whether the vpn it is clearing is one of them.
   [uptg_fixed_user_none] answers "no" for every USER vpn at ANY [fx] (from
   the spec's own range premise), and [uptg_um_fixed_none] answers the dual
   for the two fixed vpns, so the whole uvmunmap proof goes through
   generically and is sealed three times -- [UVMUNMAP] for every existing
   caller, [UVMUNMAP_BARE] for uvmfree, and [UVMUNMAP_FIXED] for
   proc_freepagetable's two [do_free = 0] calls.  Nothing else changes.

   [fx] IS GENERIC ONLY IN HERE.  Every [Module Type] pins it to one of the
   three literals below ([upt_fixed_both] / [upt_fixed_tramp] / [∅]), so no
   contract ever leaves the fixed leaves' VALUES loose.  [fx_wf] -- every key
   is [tramp_vpn] or [tf_vpn] -- is carried INSIDE [uptg] so that consumers
   never have to thread it; it is what makes [fx] and [um] automatically
   disjoint, given [upt_map_wf um].

   OWNERSHIP DOES NOT MOVE WITH THE AXIS.  [upt_pages_own] is a function of
   [um] ALONE: the trampoline's page is global kernel text and the
   trapframe's belongs to [ProcInv.proc_priv], so neither was ever owned
   here.  That is why widening [fx] costs no resource bookkeeping, and why
   dropping a fixed leaf hands nothing back.

   NOT CARRIED IN [uptg_wf]: [upt_acc_wf] (about USER EXECUTION, which a
   bare table will never do again) and the trapframe page's [page_valid].
   [proc_pt_wf] is [uptg_wf] plus those two, which is why the live
   direction of the bridge is an entailment each way with those as
   side conditions rather than one [⊣⊢].  That split IS the "no longer a
   valid user page table, but still well-formed enough to be torn down"
   tier. *)

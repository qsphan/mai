   ==== THE [first] BRANCH IS DECIDED BY A RESOURCE ======================

   This contract takes NO premise about [first] at all.  The branch at
   +0x1c is decided by [FirstTok]'s two arms, which the process that runs
   forkret carries -- so it holds, as a resource, which arm of the [if] it
   is entitled to:

     - the BOOT arm ([FirstTok.first_boot]: [first_addr ↦₄ 1] beside
       main's persistent rows, the sealed page count and fsinit's whole
       premise pile) reads 1, falls through, and runs fsinit / the
       [first = 0] store / kexec("/init");

     - the STEADY arm ([first_addr ↦₄□ 0] beside [FsReady.fs_ready]) reads
       0, takes the [c.beqz], and the boot arm is dead.

   The two arms are incompatible at one address, so "at most one process
   ever boots the file system" is a theorem about ownership rather than a
   claim about scheduling.  [FirstTok.v]'s header is the design.  WHICH ARM
   IS THE PACKAGE'S MODE: a boot-mode record carries [first_boot] as rows
   of its own beside the block minus its token, and a steady-mode one
   carries the block whole plus [FirstTok.first_done] -- the block premise
   below is that [if], and it is what makes the two modes' arms decidable
   here.

   WHAT THE BOOT ARM COSTS THIS CONTRACT is [procs_inv γs] and
   [γs !! j = Some γl] -- fsinit's and kexec's cones reach sleep/wakeup,
   whose contracts take the process table.  Those two SUBSUME the
   [is_lock γl p s Rlk] this contract used to take: the lock forkret
   releases is the table's own slot [j], so [SchedCtx.procs_inv_lookup]
   produces it and the string and the resource stop being parameters.

   Everything else the boot arm spends -- the file system's whole premise
   pile, the allocator, the log's raw cells -- rides inside the token, not
   in this precondition.

   ==== THE BOOT ARM RUNS WITH INTERRUPTS OFF ============================

   AND THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT PROVED YET.  [eb] is NOT [true] here.  This
   revision's scheduler is

       intr_on();  intr_off();  ...  acquire(&p->lock);  swtch(...)

   so [push_off] reads SIE = 0 at [noff = 0] and leaves [cpus[h].intena = 0]
   -- and forkret's own [release] at +0x10 therefore does NOT re-enable
   interrupts.  fsinit, kexec and everything under them run at [eb = false].
   (Upstream xv6 has no [intr_off()] there and does boot with the base
   enable on; the [intr_on(); intr_off()] pair is this revision's wfi-race
   fix, and it moves forkret to the disabled index.)

   The consequence is a callee-side one, and it is exactly the case
   claude-notes/completed/eb-generic-sweep.md's last section anticipated:
   fsinit, initlog, ireclaim, kexec, namei, namex and dirlookup all still
   carry [eb = true ->], on the recorded grounds that every caller reaches
   them "from a syscall or from boot with an enabled base".  forkret's boot
   arm is the caller that does not.  Generalizing those seven -- drop the
   premise, thread [trap_csrs_ext eb] / [cpu_claim_ext eb pj] in and out --
   is the prerequisite, and that file is the recipe.

   THIS CONTRACT IS ALREADY RIGHT FOR IT.  forkret holds the complement:
   [arm_pay_ext_split] turns the caller's [trap_csrs ∗ cpu_claim] into
   release's [arm_pay 0 eb p] and the [_ext] pair, and the pair is live
   across exactly the stretch the boot arm occupies.  So nothing in this
   precondition has to change when the sweep lands -- which is why it takes
   no [eb] premise now.

   ==== forkret DOES NOT RETURN ==========================================

   The [c.jalr a5] at +0x7e enters userret at [TRAMPOLINE + 0x9c] with
   a0 = MAKE_SATP(p->pagetable), and userret sret's to user mode.  So the
   contract concludes in [mWP Loop] directly, via
   [SpecUserretClosed.wp_userret_closed] -- the CLOSED trap loop, entered
   where the kernel first enters it.  Its two undischarged gaps (the
   mstatus one and the trapframe kernel-words one) are passed through
   verbatim; they are the same obligations one tier down, not new ones.

   THE KERNEL PAGE TABLE'S ROOT IS AN EXISTENTIAL HERE, which is why the
   kernel-words gap is quantified over it.  forkret reaches the table
   through [IntrDefs.strans_inv]'s KPT arm, whose root is existential (the
   sconf tier is deliberately root-free -- SpecPrepareReturn.v says the same
   about [kernel_satp]), and nothing else in this contract names it.

   ==== THE ENTRY IS THE SCHEDULER'S HAND-OFF ============================

   swtch lands here with p->lock STILL HELD from scheduler(), i.e. at
   push_off level 1 with interrupts off and "proc" in the held set -- which
   is exactly what [SwtchCtx.valid_context]'s resume wand delivers
   ([sie_cap_gpr m av false p], [cpu_own 1 eb p false {["proc"]}]) plus
   [SchedCtx.p_sched]'s own [trap_csrs].  [release] is forkret's first act
   and the whole of the index bookkeeping: [arm_pay_ext_split] turns the
   caller's [trap_csrs ∗ cpu_claim p] into release's [arm_pay 0 eb p] and
   prepare_return's [trap_csrs_ext eb ∗ cpu_claim_ext eb p], so the contract
   is generic in the base-enable [eb] and no arm needs a case split.

   ==== THE RESIDUE IS A CLOSER, NOT A PREMISE ===========================

   The trap loop runs on [SpecUsertrap]'s kernel-side bundle [URes] (=
   [usertrap_res_bare]), and forkret cannot BUILD one: the bundle is the
   union of five cones' environments (the file table, the log, the device
   caps, the syscall environment...) and forkret touches none of them.
   What forkret DOES hold is the running state of a kernel thread -- the
   stack, the per-cpu bundle, the trap ghosts, the process block -- and
   those are the bundle's OTHER half, so a contract taking [URes] beside
   them would claim each of them twice and be unsatisfiable.

   The premise is therefore the WAND: hand back what forkret's tail can
   produce ([UsertrapRes.ut_trap_parked] and the process block minus its
   page table) and get the bundle.  It is quantified over the hart because
   prepare_return parks, over the process record because prepare_return
   moves the trapframe, and OVER THE DESCRIPTOR because the boot arm's
   kexec REPLACES the address space -- the table userret runs on is not the
   one forkret was entered with, so no [pt] fixed on entry can name both.
   The two facts the switch inside userret needs of that descriptor
   ([SpecUserretClosed.loop_ok]'s pt-side conjuncts) are HANDED to the
   closer rather than taken as premises: [proc_pt_wf] is a conjunct of
   [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt] and so already inside [proc_priv], and the
   normalisation equation is discharged here with [ProcPtOwn.ud_norm], the
   same renormalisation every round of the trap loop performs.  When
   [SpecForkretPark]'s axiom is finally discharged, the caller that parks
   the process is the one that proves this wand.

   The address space itself is NOT in the wand: forkret splits [proc_pt]
   off the block ([ProcInv.proc_priv_split_pt]) and hands it to the user
   tier the way uservec's tail does, which is why the bare residue is the
   right target.

   ==== ...AND THE CLOSER IS HANDED [first_done] =========================

   THE CLOSER'S BODY NEEDS THE FILE SYSTEM AND ITS BUILDER CANNOT HAVE IT.
   [UsertrapRes.ut_caps] carries [FsReady.fs_ready] as a conjunct, and the
   syscall environment the residue's other half needs is derived from it
   too -- so whoever proves this wand has to produce [fs_ready].  The two
   places a process is parked from scratch are userinit and kfork, and AT
   USERINIT'S PARK [fs_ready] DOES NOT EXIST YET: forkret's boot arm is
   what establishes it (fsinit, then [FsReady.fs_ready_establish]), and
   that runs strictly after userinit has parked the first process.  So the
   obligation is unprovable at the site that owes it.

   That is an ordering fact, not a plumbing gap, and the fix is to move the
   resource rather than the proof: the closer takes it as an ARGUMENT.
   forkret is exactly the place that can pay, on both arms and for the same
   reason the branch exists at all --

     - the STEADY arm reads it straight out of [FirstTok.first_tok]'s
       steady disjunct, which IS this resource, persistent, so putting the
       token back into the block costs nothing;
     - the BOOT arm mints it itself -- [fs_ready_establish] at the
       [first = 0] store at +0x28, beside the [first_addr ↦₄□ 0] that
       same store discards -- and holds it to the [c.jalr].

   THE ARGUMENT IS [FirstTok.first_done], NOT [fs_ready], and the extra
   half is load-bearing rather than convenient.  [ProofSyscall.syscall_env]
   has FOUR conjuncts and its last is [first_done] itself -- the steady arm
   of proc.c's [static int first], which fork hands to every child.  Its
   [first_addr ↦₄□ 0] half is minted by exactly one instruction in the
   kernel, the [first = 0] store on forkret's boot arm, so a closer given only
   [fs_ready] would still be missing a row that userinit -- which parks the
   very process that will run that store -- could not possibly supply.
   [first_done] is what both arms hold and is what closes the environment.

   So the wand's builder owes only what it can have: the persistent rows
   [first_done] does NOT supply ([is_ftable], the [wait_lock], the ticks
   lock, [devintr_caps_any], [procs_avail], [console_ready_app], the nextpid
   lock), all of which main creates before userinit runs and all of which
   kfork's parent already holds.

   ==== THE PARK HAS TWO MODES, AND forkret DECIDES WHICH IS LIVE ========

   The closer hands back a slot for the record forkret resumes with, and
   the party that has to OWN that slot is the parker.  What it can own
   depends on whether the boot arm can still run:

     - [steady = false] -- THE BOOT MODE.  It can, and it does: this record
       IS the first process, which the package says by carrying
       [FirstTok.first_boot]'s rows beside a block without them.
       kexec("/init") replaces the address space between the park and the
       resume, so no key captured at the park is still the resume's; what
       the parker owns instead is the EXEC BUNDLE that arm spends
       ([InitBoot.init_boot_bundle]), whose slot piece answers at the key
       kexec builds.  The closer owes no slot, and the kernel mints none
       (userinit).

     - [steady = true] -- THE STEADY MODE.  The boot arm cannot run, and the
       parker proves it by handing over [FirstTok.first_done].  Then the
       resume is the steady arm, which lands on a record carrying the parked
       one's RUN KEY -- the resume register file, the resume pc, the image,
       the permission view, the size and the cwd ([UexecRet.urun_eq]) -- so
       ONE slot at the parked record suffices and the closer's pure premise
       re-keys it (kfork).

   forkret is where the promise is cashed, and it cases on the MODE: at
   [true] its steady arm PROVES the run key of the record it ends on and
   its boot arm is REFUTED, because [first_done]'s [first_addr ↦₄□ 0]
   cannot coexist with the block token's boot disjunct
   ([FirstTok.first_tok_boot_excl]); at [false] it walks the boot arm on
   the rows the package handed it.  That is why the bit, the block's shape
   and the mode's resource are premises HERE and not in the closer. *)

       [UexecRet.urun_eq] does not read one.  [false]: the parker captured a
       slot family and owes nothing extra; the closer asks nothing.

       steady arm proves the run key it is asked for, and the BOOT arm --

(* FsDurSnap.v -- SNAPSHOT COMMITS: the durable file-system instance is
   ALLOCATED AFRESH at every group commit and never updated.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/durable-fs-plan.md sections 2, 4
   and 5; the worklist is claude-notes/projects/durable-disk.md.

   THE ONE IDEA.  No durable ghost is ever moved.  At a group commit the
   committer ALLOCATES a fresh gname family at the quiescent state's
   values, proves the whole file-system predicate at BIRTH, and DISCARDS
   the previous instance (the logic is affine).  Allocation is
   unconditionally frame-preserving, so every update wall the project met
   -- the auth-in-frame refutation, the completeness demand, the accessor
   chain's missing intermediate object, the deferred ledger's cross-op
   eviction, the kinds tie's geometry -- is vacated by construction: there
   is nothing to update.

   WHAT THE TRANSPORT TAKES.  Its inputs are a VALUE and PURE FACTS, and
   NOTHING ELSE -- no era resource, no previous instance, no authority
   loan.  That is what makes it callable at the commit (where the era's
   pieces are distributed behind [iregN]/[ftopN]/[bitmapN] and the icache
   escrow, hence unreachable at any mask) and callable at BOOT to clone
   the current snapshot onto a fresh ERA family (plan section 5).

   THE POINTS-TO IS EXCLUSIVE.  [snap_gamma]'s [fsΦ] is the FULL ghost-map
   element [a -> v], exactly as the era's [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L] is, and
   that is what makes the [∗] between two inodes of a durable [fs_state]
   MEAN something: under a persistent points-to the conjunction is vacuous
   -- two inodes naming one block would satisfy it -- and disjointness
   would have to live in a pure clause instead.  Here it IS the resources,
   which is why [fs_snap_read_ok] can derive [sk_disj] rather than carry it.

   WHERE THE VALUE-FIRST ALLOCATOR WENT (durable-disk lane H5).  Taking a
   byte MAP and CARVING [FsState.fs_state] out of it by pure disjointness
   clauses is ERA 0'S BUSINESS AND NOBODY ELSE'S -- it is the one producer
   with no source instance to mint from -- so the carve lives in
   [FsDurAlloc.v], above this file, and its single caller is
   [FsDurImg.img_P_dur_alloc].  What is left here is the REGISTRY: the
   epoch's shape ([fs_snap], [P_dur]), the mint off a SOURCE INSTANCE
   ([P_dur_alloc_xfer], EV-Y: the transport is the caller and no pure
   disjointness fact is materialised), the reading back out
   ([fs_snap_read_ok]) and the commit's swap ([dsnap_step_merge]).

   [FsStateDefs.phi_excl] HOLDS AT THE SNAPSHOT ([snap_gamma_excl]), so
   [FsStateBitmap.free_pool_used] -- hence xv6's "freeing free block"
   panic arm -- and [FsStateDefs.blk_owned_ne] read on the durable side
   exactly as they do at the era's view.

   WHAT IS NOT PERSISTENT, and why the snapshot as a whole is not: the
   link family's per-inum [auth nlink] has no core.  Nothing needs to
   borrow a snapshot -- it lives inside [crashN] and its consumers read
   the PURE [snap_ok], which is persistent -- so the bundle stays
   exclusive and the receipts are copies of the pure tie. *)

     the family, which is what [FsState.fs_links_alloc] needs; the SLACK --
     one spare fragment at [ROOTINO] -- is what a BOOT MINT needs on top of

     ([InodeRegion.ireg_keep], [ireg_root] being [ROOTINO]) that no
     directory entry accounts for: [FsStateInode.ent_tokenless] exempts a
     SELF record, so the root's [".."] carries none and the image's
     [nlink = 1] at the root would otherwise be unclaimed.  Stated as ONE
     clause rather than two because the plain form is its own left factor
     ([sk_links_plain] below) and the record has exactly two readers.
     [FsState.fs_boot_alloc_root_slack] is the mint's [own_alloc] at it:
     one allocation yields [fs_links] plus the spare token.
     The IMAGE discharges it from [FsImg.fsimg_wf_root_link] through

     [ireg_keep] beside the collected [FsState.fs_links]

     THE CHOICE FUNCTION rides in front of it (durable-disk G5): each
     entry's register value is existential in the bundle, so the family's
     element is indexed by one value function per inum, each satisfying that

     plan section 5's first missing clause).  [sk_dom] names the inums below
     [ninodes]; a BOOT MINT has to re-found the inode region, whose width is
     [16 * nib] with [nib = ninodes/16 + 1] -- mkfs rounds [ninodes] up to a
     whole block, and [InodeRegion.ireg_recs] is sixteen records per region
     block, so [IcacheBoot.ireg_alloc] / [ipool_alloc] / [ftop_alloc] all run
     over [region_inums nib] and not over [[0, ninodes)].  The width is
     spelled off [S]'s own superblock rather than taken as a parameter,
     because [snap_bytes] is a function of [S] and [D] alone.

     IT IS A DOMAIN ROW AND NOT A CONTENT CLAUSE, so section 0's local rule
     is untouched: it says nothing about any node.  Both producers have it:
     the image's node map IS [region_inums nib]
     ([FsCfgBoot.img_nodes_keys]), and at a commit the collected state is
     the [ftop] map restricted to the region ([FsCollect.col_hand]'s domain
     row, against [col_geom]'s width tie [cg_width]).

  (* ---- THE THREE DIRECTORY CLAUSES THE ESCROW PAYLOADS CARRY
     (durable-disk lane E-clauses; plan section 5's mint).
     [FsStateInode.node_dir_local] is [DirView.dir_ok] (every live entry's
     inum is inside the region), [dir_dots_ix] (a live directory's records
     0 and 1 POSITIONALLY are the dots -- which [inl_dir_dot] /
     [inl_dir_dotdot] do NOT say: those are about the name -> inum view)
     and [dir_orphan_clean] (an orphan directory holds only dot records).
     [IcacheEscrow.ipool_alloc] and [ic_loaded] take all three, so a BOOT
     MINT that re-founds the pool from a snapshot needs them; the escrow's
     deposit arms re-prove exactly these at every [iunlock], so the commit
     reads them off the same payloads it reads [inode_local] off
     ([FsCollect.col_side]'s bundle arm).

     IT IS PER-OBJECT, and it is here rather than in [inode_local] because
     [dir_ok] needs the REGION'S WIDTH: [inode_local i n] takes an inum and
     a node and nothing else, while a [snap_bytes] clause may read [S]'s own
     superblock -- which is exactly how [sk_regdom] is stated, and
     [FsState.fs_nib] is that same [ninodes/16 + 1].

  (* ---- THE LEDGER'S KEYS ARE REAL BLOCKS (durable-disk lane E-himg).
     Every block [D] names lies below the state's OWN [size].  It is the one
     direction the clauses above do not give: they say which blocks [D] MUST
     hold (the metadata, a node's own, every free block below [size]), and
     this says [D] holds nothing else.

     WHAT IT IS FOR: a BOOT MINT re-founds the era's configuration from the
     snapshot, and [FsReady.fgo_covbelow] -- "every covered block is a real
     file-system block" -- is a fact about the era's [cov] against the era's
     [size].  [cov] is fixed across power cycles and [fss_sb S] is not, so
     nothing outside the snapshot can relate them; with this clause and
     [dom D = fs_home_set cov ls] the relation IS the snapshot's.  Both
     producers have it for free: at the image [D]'s domain is the home set,
     which the image's own [FsBoot.fs_cov_in] and disk-size bound put below
     [size]; at a commit it is [FsCollect.cg_size] verbatim.

  (* THE GUEST'S MERGE (SY3-K2): the new guest at [gt] out of whichever
     old guest the crash slot holds.  The commit builds it at the
     collection, where the running claim is in hand and the old guest is
     not, and the header write's permit -- where the old guest is in hand
     and the running claim is not -- applies it ([dsnap_step_merge]).  A
     BASIC update, so it runs at the permit's mask [∅]; the guest stays
     OPAQUE, and a guest with nothing to carry drops the old one
     ([AppInv.app_merge_raw_of_xfer]).
     ...AND THE APPLICATION'S TOKEN [T] RIDES IT (sync K3-3,
     claude-notes/design/sync.md §4.3 item 2): the collection hands the
     token in, and whichever arm the commit takes gives it back -- the
     header write's permit applies the LEFT arm to the old guest (the
     token comes out beside the new guest, bare: the wand captured it), the
     EMPTY-LOG commit, which writes no header, takes the RIGHT arm.  An
     additive pair because exactly one of the two fires.
     ...AND THE LEFT ARM IS LENT THE MACHINE'S STARTED AUTH (sync SY3-A1,
     design §4.5 "The merge"): [start_auth n] at [n = gd + 1], [gd] the
     era's generation.  Both appliers hold it -- the header write's permit
     ([FsCrash.fs_rec_permit] binds it) and the ghost commit (the custody
     fupd, [HartCustody.wp_crash_fupd]) -- and it comes back untouched; an
     application reads the era bound off it against the old copy's own
     era certificate.  [gd] is a parameter, pinned to the era's [gen_id]
     by [LogInv.log_ctx]. *)

  (* THE PAIR (round C): the snapshot AND an OPAQUE guest at its map name
     -- since SY3-K2 the guest's MERGE rather than the guest itself, so the
     old durable copy is read, not dropped.  Under a later, because the
     application's laws yield [▷ A]; this is the shape the WAL's commit
     permit takes ([LogSnapLaw.snap_law_out]).  The WAL never learns what

  (* THE COMMIT'S STEP TAKES THE NEXT PAIR ITSELF (durable-disk lane H2;
     round C).  The file system builds its own epoch, and the guest beside
     it, at its own ghost step where its invariants are open
     ([FsCollectAll.fs_snap_law_build]), and the WAL only swaps the pair
     over.  The old snapshot is DISCARDED (affine) and nothing is read out
     of it, which is why the step needs no premise about [D] at all; the
     old GUEST goes to the pair's merge (SY3-K2), which yields the new one.
     The guest stays OPAQUE here, and so does the token the merge hands
     back (sync K3-3); the started auth is lent through (SY3-A1). *)

     footprint at the era's own view, plus the bytes the file system does
     not claim, out.  Nothing is allocated and nothing is carved -- the

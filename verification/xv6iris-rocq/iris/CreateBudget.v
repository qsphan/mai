(* CreateBudget.v -- THE OP-WIDE LEDGER OF create, ARM BY ARM, MACHINE
   CHECKED (fs-icache.md section 18 clause 1; fs-sysfile S5a).

   Section 18 named create as the consumer that forces budget-bearing fs
   contracts into SET FORM, and left the arithmetic to this stage.  Here
   it is, in the shape [WriteiBudget] set for writei: the pure accounting
   first, as functions of OBSERVABLE booleans, and the contracts after.

   ==== THE VERDICT ======================================================

   **xv6 is log-sound at create.**  The op's distinct-block set is at most
   SIX --

     IBLOCK(ip)      ialloc's claim, ip's iupdate, and the iupdate inside
                     every dirlink on ip
     IBLOCK(dp)      dp's nlink++ iupdate and the iupdate inside
                     dirlink(dp, name)
     bmapstart       THE bitmap block -- there is exactly one
                     ([WriteiBudget.one_bitmap_block])
     ip's block 0    the new directory's first data block
     dp's block      the block the new entry lands in
     dp's indirect   only when the parent is past NDIRECT blocks

   -- against MAXOPBLOCKS = 10, and every one of create's twelve logging
   calls either introduces one of those six or ABSORBS against a block one
   of its predecessors already logged.  Nothing goes in
   claude-notes/kernel-defects.md.

   THE SIX SURVIVE nameiparent (fs-sysfile "BLOCKER A, RESOLVED";
   fs-log.md §G.5).  create's walk is a thirteenth logging call and it is
   now on the list below ([np_spend]), but it adds no SEVENTH block: a
   level that frees writes only [bmapstart] -- already one of the six --
   and the freed inode's own block, which is in the group's header
   already, since the unlink that armed the free had to run inside this
   same op window to have emptied it.  That is what [crz] claims and what
   the region's zero receipt proves.  So the walk's whole contribution to
   the ledger is at most ONE unit on a block that was already priced.

   ==== WHAT THE ARITHMETIC SHOWS THE CONTRACTS MUST DO ==================

   The counted sums are hopeless: [4 * dirlink_units = 28] on its own.
   But so is the SET FORM AS LANDED, and that is this file's real finding.
   [wp_writei_gen] threads [log_opS] and promises [Sb ⊆ Sb'], but its
   spend bound is still the LOOSE per-call constant
   ([ncount - wi_cost_bmonly off n <= n']), and

     10 - 1(ialloc) - 1(iupdate) - 4 - 4 - 4  <  0,

   so three dirlinks do not fit even in set form.  What closes it is
   ABSORPTION CREDITS in the spend bound -- the same device [SpecBmap]
   already carries for the bitmap block ([bmap_cost cr al ind], honest
   because of the premise [cr = true -> bmapstart ∈ Sb]), extended to the
   two other blocks a dirlink logs: the DATA block it writes and the
   DIRECTORY's own inode block.  With those three booleans the ledger
   closes with room, and the TIGHTEST arm -- the late failure, which runs
   two iunlockputs after a dirlink that spent everything it was allowed --
   closes at EXACTLY [iput_units].

   The three booleans, the honesty premises they owe, and the four files
   the retrofit touches are written up in projects/fs-sysfile.md's S5a
   section.  Nothing in this file is a contract; it is the arithmetic the
   contracts will be checked against, landed first and on purpose. *)

   is unconditional. *)
Definition ia_spend : nat := 1.

(* ---- iupdate: ONE log_write, of [IBLOCK inum inodestart].  Straight
   line, so the set growth is DETERMINATE (that is [wp_iupdate_gen], S3m

   ABSORB, which is the credit this file needs and that contract does not

   itself now exposes the figure ([SpecWritei.wi16_post]), so the
   definitions live at the seam and this file uses them by import.
   [SpecWritei.wi16_spend] inlines [iu_spend]'s if, definitionally equal
   to the shape this file's lemmas were proven at. *)


(* ---- dirlink: dirlookup and readi log NOTHING, so a dirlink spends
   either its writei (the append arm) or its iput (the found arm).
   [dl_spend] / [dl_need] / [dl_need_values] MOVED to SpecDirlink.v (D₀
   pre-stage 1) for the reason [wi16_spend] moved to SpecWritei.v: the
   set-form contract's budget premise is now stated AT [dl_need], because
   the constant [dirlink_units = 7] makes the mkdir chain below
   unsatisfiable -- dirlinks #2 and #3 run with six and five in hand.  The
   definitions live at the seam and this file uses them by import. *)

(* ---- iput (through iunlockput): NOTHING unless it frees, and a free
   spends only what it cannot absorb -- itrunc's [bfree]s all hit THE
   bitmap block and its final iupdate hits [IBLOCK inum]. *)
Definition ip_spend (crb cru freed : bool) : nat :=

Definition ip_need : nat := iput_units.

Lemma ip_need_value : ip_need = 3.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(* ---- nameiparent (fs-log.md §G.5): create's FIRST call, and until group
   absorption it was not on this list at all.  Under group absorption the
   whole walk spends AT MOST ONE unit -- THE bitmap block -- because every
   per-level [iunlockput] runs credited on the inode block ([crz], minted
   at namex's +0xce nlink guard and cashed by the region's receipt), so
   the only thing a freeing level can fail to absorb is the bitmap; and
   the first level that does pay puts [bmapstart] in the op's set, so
   every later level absorbs that too.  (The trio's post does not expose
   this figure YET -- see fs-log.md §G.20 for what still blocks it -- so,
   exactly as when this file was written, the arithmetic lands first and
   the contract is checked against it.)

   [w] is the ONE observable the walk's post exposes: "it paid", which is
   the same fact as [bmapstart ∈ Sb'] afterwards.  It is what makes the
   arms below close, and it is why the row does not simply subtract one:
   whoever pays for the bitmap first, the other absorbs, so the walk's
   unit is create's own first [dirlink]'s unit and not a second one.
   That is the team's refutation of BLOCKER A as an inequality. *)

(* THE FLIP, AT THE FIGURE ITSELF.  Both interior entries close against the
   credit-aware spend at EVERY value of the reported booleans, provided the
   failing append's window is DIRECT -- and it is, for +0x106: that link
   goes into the fresh child, whose slots 0 and 1 are both in its block 0.
   The arithmetic is [wi16_spend]'s own worst corner at [ind = false],
   which is three ([bmap_cost crb al false <= 2], the data-block term free
   whenever [al], and one for an unabsorbed [iupdate]) against six in hand
   and an [ip_need] of three.  [al] is in fact FALSE on this arm -- a
   bmap that broke out of blocks allocated no data block, and a direct
   window's indirect slot never moves ([SpecBmap] clause (e)) -- so the
   real figure is at most two; the theorem does not need that. *)
Theorem cr_fail_mkdir_closes (w crb crd cru al : bool) :
  let u1 := cr_uw w - ia_spend in
  let u2 := u1 - iu_spend true in
  let u3 := u2 - dl_spend w false false true false in    (* dirlink(ip,".")  *)
  let u4 := u3 - dl_spend true true true false false in  (* dirlink(ip,"..") *)
  ip_need <= u3 - wi16_spend crb crd cru al false /\
  ip_need <= u4 - wi16_spend crb crd cru al false.
Proof. destruct w, crb, crd, cru, al; vm_compute; lia. Qed.

(* ...AND ON THE INDIRECT PATH, WHICH IS +0x118's ([dirlink(dp, name)] goes
   into the PARENT, of any size), the same holds as soon as the bitmap
   block is already in the op's set -- and it is: the mkdir arm's FIRST
   dirlink allocated the child's block 0, and an allocating writei reports
   [bmapstart ∈ Sb'] ([SpecWritei.wi16_post]'s membership half, which is
   exactly what that clause is for).  The one corner that does NOT close is
   [crb = false] with an allocating indirect window, where the figure is
   four; it is unreachable here for that reason. *)
Theorem cr_fail_mkdir_closes_ind (w crd cru al : bool) :

Proof. destruct w, crd, cru, al; vm_compute; lia. Qed.

(* ...AND THAT CORNER IS ATTAINED, WHICH IS WHY THE COLLAPSE HAD TO BE A
   SHAPE CHANGE RATHER THAN A SMALLER CONSTANT.  An allocating INDIRECT
   window at an unpaid bitmap block spends the full four
   ([SpecWritei.wi16_spend_le4] is the bound; this is the witness), so
   [SpecDirlink.dl0_spend = 4] was already the best constant available and
   no arithmetic could have bought the interior mkdir entries their three.
   What buys it is the per-call VARIATION -- the two theorems above. *)
Lemma cr_wi16_spend_max : wi16_spend false false false true true = 4%nat.
Proof. vm_compute. reflexivity. Qed.

(* THE CREDIT ON THE INODE BLOCK IS LOAD BEARING TOO: an uncredited
   iupdate inside every dirlink costs three more units across the mkdir
   arm, and the late fail arm again runs out. *)

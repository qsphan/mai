(* ProofFilewrite.v -- THE ONE filewrite() walk.  Seals
   [SpecFilewrite.FILEWRITE], whose arms are keyed on the descriptor's
   state: the per-chunk two-phase commit FUSED INTO THE ROW RETAG on an
   inode, the UART's accepted-trace receipt on the console, and the landed
   blanket everywhere else.

   ==== ONE WALK, FOUR ARMS =============================================

   * the [f->writable] early return, the FD_PIPE arm, the [panic] arm and
     the device arm's out-of-range and null-slot exits answer the landed
     blanket and arm nothing;
   * the FD_INODE loop carries [ProofFilewriteChain.fw_au_raw]: the fire
     ([FsAbsWriteFire.wrf_awrite_fire]) STANDS WHERE THE RETAG STANDS; the
     offset shadow's half goes in at the chunk's offset, the client hands
     it back unmoved and the fire advances it out of the descriptor's
     [OffGv.off_user_inv] -- all inside the one [ftopN] critical section,
     which is what makes the pair ONE instant per chunk.  There is no receipt family; the
     caller's PREFIX CURSOR [Q] is what each node's phase 2 advances;
   * the FD_DEVICE arm calls consolewrite
     ([SpecConsolewrite.CONSOLEWRITE]) at EVERY major, and that is
     why one walk serves both: [filewrite_dev_env] says the cell is "null or
     consolewrite" everywhere, so the arm must be able to call consolewrite
     where the descriptor's major is not the console's.  Since lane
     OUT-FUPD the callee's premise is the caller's JUSTIFICATION CHAIN and
     no longer a free trace seed, so [SpecFilewrite.filewrite_in]'s device
     arm asks for it at EVERY major -- one walk, one premise.  What is the
     console's alone is the devsw PIN, which refutes the null-slot -1; off
     the console the caller's cursor is dropped.

   ==== WHAT THE APPLICATION'S STEP COSTS ===============================

   Nothing this contract asks its caller for: the FD_INODE arm's per-chunk
   row retag pays the application's claim out of the chain's own node
   ([FsAbsWriteFire.awrite_full_at]'s [app_step]).

   ==== THE TYPE READING, AND WHY IT IS AVAILABLE =======================

   The fire needs [bv_unsigned (di_type dnl) = T_FILE_z].
   [inode_rec_local] enumerates the four legal type words;
   [InodeLock.inode_ok] rules out 0; the carve's fourth output rules out
   T_DIR on a writable fd; and the carve's FIFTH output -- the owner's
   [file_payload] strengthening -- rules out T_DEVICE on an FD_INODE fd.

   THE INUM BRIDGE.  [fdstate_ok]'s [FdInode] arm ties the contract's inum
   to the payload's, but [file_pay_st_ok] and
   [SpecFileread.fileread_pay_carve] bind that [inum] under two SEPARATE
   existentials.  [fwau_pay_carve] below is the carve with the state fact as
   a sixth output -- the two read off ONE [pn] -- so the loop gets the tie
   once per iteration and the cursor speaks about the caller's file. *)



(* ProofFilewrite.v -- filewrite's own control flow and ghost steps.
   ========================== COMPLETE, S3t ============================

   STATUS (S3t): PROVEN, WITH NO AXIOM OF ITS OWN.  [FilewriteProof] is at
   the bottom of this file, [wp_filewrite_sconf] is proved for every path,
   and [LinkFilewrite.v] instantiates it.  Instruction by instruction:

     * +0x00/+0x04, the pre-prologue [f->writable] test, and its -1 return
       at +0x10c with sp and the whole frame untouched;
     * the prologue ([fw_pro]) and the three-way type dispatch at
       +0x16..+0x2c;
     * FD_PIPE in full: [c.ld a0,16(a0)], the [jal pipewrite], the [c.j] to
       [fw_epi];
     * FD_DEVICE in full, all four of its paths: the out-of-range major
       (+0x126), the null [devsw] slot (+0x12a), the [c.jalr] into
       consolewrite, and the [c.j] to [fw_epi];
     * the ELSE arm ([fw_panic]);
     * FD_INODE's entry: the s4 spill at +0x30, the HOISTED [n <= 0] test at
       +0x32, the whole ZERO-TRIP path (+0xe6 -> +0xf4 -> [fw_tail] ->
       [fw_epi]), and, on the other side of that test, the five late spills
       at +0x36..+0x3e, both [lui]/[addi] pairs for 3072, [i := 0],
       [user := 1], and the [c.j] to the bottom test;
     * THE LOOP: [fw_loop], the [forall]-fuel induction at [n - i]; [fw_test],
       the +0xcc..+0xd8 chunk computation in BOTH arms; the [sext.w] at
       +0x82; and (S3t) the BODY -- begin_op, [ld a0,24(s2)], ilock at
       [s/2], the four argument moves and the [f->off] checkout, writei at
       [user = true], [fw_offupd] (the +0xa6 skip in both arms), the
       check-in and the re-park, iunlock, end_op, the short-write break at
       +0xc0, [i += r] at +0xc4 and the exhaustion test at +0xc8 whose fall
       IS the back edge.

   THE TWO STRUCTURAL DEVICES, and they are the whole reason this file is
   ~2900 lines and not ~4500.  A ROCQ PROOF CANNOT JOIN TWO ARMS, so a
   diamond in the control-flow graph doubles everything after it unless it
   is lifted into a lemma whose continuation is quantified over exactly
   what the two arms disagree about.  There are two such diamonds:

     * [fw_test] (+0xcc..+0xd8), which disagrees about the chunk [c] and
       the register file;
     * [fw_offupd] (+0xa6..+0xb0), which disagrees about the register file
       and the word [f->off] ends up holding.

   A THIRD diamond -- writei's own return disjunction -- is collapsed not
   by a lemma but by ONE [assert] ([Hjoin]): both arms produce a count
   [rz] in [-1 .. c], the two PURE re-park facts ([InodeLock.inode_ok] and
   [DirView.dir_ok] at the record writei returned) and [dn0' = dn'], and
   nothing below the [assert] mentions the arms again.

   WHAT THE INVARIANT TURNED OUT TO BE.  Three things are loop-carried
   ([i] and the page-table descriptor -- the bitmap's marked set is NOT,
   since the bitmap now lives in a persistent invariant) and almost
   nothing else is.  The inode is PARKED in the escrow at the head of every
   iteration, so no [dinode], no [blkmap] and no [data] appears in the
   invariant; ilock mints them inside the iteration and iunlock parks them
   again.  [f->off] is likewise RESIDENT in [off_inv] at the head, borrowed
   and returned within one iteration.  The environment splits cleanly:
   fifteen PERSISTENT invariants (the bitmap's among them) plus the ten
   pure fields, threaded free, and an exclusive half that is exactly
   [filewrite_fs_out fn], i.e. the four resources the contract itself
   returns.  That is why the exit needs no re-assembly.

   THE CROSSING CONVENTION (S3t).  [SpecFilewrite]'s and
   [SpecConsolewrite]'s crossings are the literal [true], not [b]: every
   arm of filewrite parks, and the porting guide's rule is that a PARKING
   function's [wp_next] index is [true] unconditionally.  With the
   contract's [eb = true] and [CpuOwn.cpu_own_eb_agree] at level 0 the two
   spellings coincide at every constructible instance, so this is not a
   change of strength -- but [cpu_own_transport] is asked at [b], and from
   a [true]-indexed chain fact the [b]-indexed guard is UNDERIVABLE.  So
   [b = true] is pinned once per lemma as [Hb] and rewritten into the
   TRANSPORTS ONLY, never into [sie_cap_gpr] or [cpu_own], whose spelling
   has to keep matching the callee contracts.

   =====================================================================
   S3p: BLOCKER SIX IS REPAIRED.  THE WALK HAS NOTHING OWED IN FRONT OF IT.
   =====================================================================

   S3o stopped at ONE premise of ONE call -- writei's, at +0xa0 -- and S3p
   fixed the contract.  [SpecWritei.v] now carries [SpecReadi.v]'s shape
   verbatim: the pid fraction is the KERNEL arm's and rides INSIDE the
   [if user] bracket, in the precondition and the postcondition of both
   [wp_writei_sconf_body] and [wp_writei_gen_body].  So the walk, standing
   at +0xa0 holding [proc_priv_core pj pidv V] and nothing else, satisfies the
   source premise EXACTLY -- see [fw_writei_src] below, which is that
   discharge, machine-checked, at the [user = true] the decode forces.
   Inside writei the quarter is borrowed out of [proc_priv] by
   [ProofWritei.wi_src_pid] and closed again around each of bmap / bread /
   brelse / iupdate; [either_copyin] always sees the block whole.  Nothing
   above writei moved -- the new premise is strictly weaker -- so the
   [Print Assumptions] cones of Writei and Dirlink are unchanged.

   WHAT THE STOP WAS, kept because the lesson is the durable part.  S3n
   cleared this call by reading SpecWritei's premise COMMENT ("on the user
   arm this is proc_priv's own quarter"), which was the stale sentence
   [SpecReadi.v]:255-263 had already refuted in terms.  The accessor's TYPE
   refutes it in one line: [ProcInv.proc_priv_pid] is a BORROW
   ([proc_priv -∗ p_pid ↦₄{1/4} ∗ (p_pid ↦₄{1/4} -∗ proc_priv)],
   ProcInv.v:892), so it consumes the block; and the cell totals one, with
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_core] holding a half and [SchedCtx.proc_pub] the
   other behind [p->lock], so there was no third fragment to find.  A
   premise justified by a comment is not cleared.  Clear it against a
   signature, a lemma, or a [vm_compute].

   WHAT IS *NOT* BLOCKED.  S3o re-checked every other premise of every other
   call by hand against what the walk holds at each instruction, and the pid
   pair was the ONLY unsatisfiable one.  The four other loop callees are
   clear because none of them wants [proc_priv] at all -- [SpecBeginOp],
   [SpecIlock], [SpecIunlock] and [SpecEndOp] each take the bare
   [p_pid pj ↦₄{dq} pidv] at a universally quantified [dq], which the
   accessor supplies (lend before the [jal], close the wand the instant it
   returns -- fileread's discipline at ProofFileread.v:1685/1712).  In
   particular:

     - writei's eighteen numeric/pure premises all close: (2) by
       [fw_budget_ok], (13) by [SpecFilewrite.fw_chunk_joint], (14) by
       [fw_size_lt31], (8)(9)(10)(11)(12) are conjuncts 3,4,1,6,2 of the
       [InodeLock.inode_ok] ilock hands out inside [ic_loaded], and
       (3)-(7),(15),(16) are [filewrite_fs_env]'s own pure fields;
     - every writei RESOURCE other than the pid pair is in hand:
       [i_dev]/[i_inum] at [1/2] and [inode_meta]/[inode_map]/
       [inode_blocks]/[dinode_at] come out of ilock's [ic_loaded]
       ([dn0 := dn]), the three superblock cells + [bitmap_inv] +
       [ireg_inv] + [bslots 3] out of the environment, and
       [log_op γ MAXOPBLOCKS] out of begin_op;
     - THE RE-PARK CLOSES.  [fw_inode_ok_rebuild] below assembles
       [inode_ok] from writei's post verbatim -- conjuncts 5 and 7 are
       S3i's two preservations, whose antecedents are the SAME conjuncts of
       the [inode_ok] that came in -- and [fw_dir_ok_wi] makes [dir_ok]
       vacuous from [ity_shot_agree] plus [fw_wbool_of_fall];
     - iunlock's [ity_shot g (di_type dn')] is ilock's own witness
       unchanged, because [fw_wi_type] says writei never moves [di_type];
     - the share algebra, the stack constants, the offset choreography and
       the two [FW_MAX]s are S3n's five clearances and stand.

   THE REPAIR, AS LANDED (S3p).  [SpecReadi.v]:244-267 was the template and
   it transferred without surprise: the pid fraction moved into the KERNEL
   arm of the [if user], in the precondition AND the postcondition, of BOTH
   [wp_writei_sconf_body] and [wp_writei_gen_body].  Inside [ProofWritei.v]
   the borrow is ONE lemma over a [user]-indexed dfrac,

       Definition wi_q `{XI : CurCtx} (user : bool) (dq : dfrac) : dfrac :=
         if user then DfracOwn (1/4) else dq.
       Lemma wi_src_pid `{XI : CurCtx} … : <the bracket> -∗
         p_pid (proc_addr j) ↦₄{wi_q user dq} pidv ∗
         (p_pid (proc_addr j) ↦₄{wi_q user dq} pidv -∗ <the bracket>).

   -- which is cheaper than the sized version of this note predicted, because
   every fraction-taking callee quantifies its [dq], so ONE accessor serves
   both arms and NO call site case-splits on [user].  It is opened just
   before each of bmap / bread / the two brelses / iupdate and closed the
   instant each returns; [either_copyin] therefore always sees the bracket
   whole, and the two [iAssert]s that split the source around the copy grew
   the fraction into their kernel arm rather than case-splitting.
   Downstream, ONE consumer moved -- [ProofDirlink.v]:2042 is [user = false]
   and just [iCombine]s its two arguments across the call.  Nothing above
   writei changed, because the new premise is strictly WEAKER, and the
   [Print Assumptions] cones of Writei and Dirlink are byte-identical.
   file-table.md's OWED note is now DONE.

   Why the split: the whole-function walk is ~2500 lines of instruction-wise
   Iris in [ProofFileread.v]'s style (that file's single lemma is 2139 lines
   for FOUR arms and NO loop; filewrite adds a bottom-tested loop with a
   nine-component invariant).  The pure [nat]/[Z]/[Qp] obligations it needs
   are separable, and they are separated here for the same reason
   [ProofFileread.v] hoists its own [fr_av_*] / [fr_ret_*] block above the
   module: a [lia] cannot run at a call site, where the context holds a
   register file (durable-notes, "an [mword] merely in CONTEXT").

   S3n VERIFIED, BEFORE ANY OF THE WALK -- the five things that could have
   made this stage a sixth blocker, and did not:

   1. THE STACK CONSTANTS CLOSE, and [filewrite_stack] is EXACTLY TIGHT on
      writei.  [filewrite_stack = 12 + K_writei = 82], every call is made
      after the 12-slot push, so each callee needs [<= K - 12 = 70]:
      writei 70 (equality), pipewrite 64, consolewrite 62, end_op 58,
      ilock 44, begin_op 26, iunlock 26.  [SpecFilewrite]'s header claim
      ("its deepest callee is writei, the others are smaller") HOLDS, and
      the [fw_av_*] block below is the machine-checked form of it.
   2. THE BUDGET PREMISE IS UNIFORM IN [off].  S3m's headline number is
      [wi_cost_bmonly 1023 FW_MAX = 10]; what the loop actually needs is
      that bound at EVERY offset, since [f->off] is not block-aligned.
      [WriteiBudget.wi_cost_bmonly_fits] is already stated that way -- its
      only hypothesis is [n <= FW_MAX], with [off] universally quantified,
      because [wi_blocks_le4] bounds [off `mod` BSIZE] rather than [off].
      So every chunk filewrite can ask for is payable.  ([fw_budget_ok].)
   3. THE SHARE ALGEBRA COMPOSES.  SpecIlock v5 consumes
      [inode_shr_gen k s dev inum g] and returns the checkout descriptor;
      SpecIunlock takes that deposit back and
      returns the arity-preserving [inode_shr k s dev inum].  Lending
      [s/2] therefore leaves [inode_shr_gen k (s/2) .. g] in hand and gets
      [inode_shr k (s/2) ..] back, which is exactly [fw_shr_regen]'s two
      arguments, and [Qp.div_2] rejoins them at [s].  ([fw_qp_halves].)
   4. **HALF OF THIS WAS REFUTED AT S3o AND REPAIRED AT S3p.**  The half
      that always HELD: [dinode_at gi inum dn0] is not in the environment
      and does not need to be; it arrives inside ilock's [ic_loaded] payload
      (fileread destructs it as "Hdnat" at ProofFileread.v:1741), at
      [dn0 := dn].  The half that was WRONG: [p_pid pj] canNOT be split out
      of [proc_priv] alongside it, because [ProcInv.proc_priv_pid] is a
      BORROW.  S3p made that a non-question by moving the fraction into the
      kernel arm of writei's bracket, so the walk never asks for it -- it
      hands over [proc_priv] and writei does its own borrowing.  See the
      banner and [fw_writei_src].
   5. end_op ACCEPTS A PARTIALLY SPENT RESERVATION.  [SpecEndOp] takes
      [log_op g u] for ANY [u] (its header says so at :30 and the premise is
      at :142), so the loop never has to prove that a chunk spent its whole
      begin_op grant -- writei promises spend-AT-MOST and the remainder is
      simply carried into end_op.

   S3n SURPRISE, and the one thing that will bite the walk mechanically:
   THERE ARE TWO CONSTANTS NAMED [FW_MAX] AND THIS FILE MUST IMPORT BOTH.
   [SysWriteDefs.FW_MAX : Z] (the chunk size as the [lui]/[addi] pairs
   materialise it) and [WriteiBudget.FW_MAX : nat] (the same 3072 as the
   budget lemmas' hypothesis) are DIFFERENT CONSTANTS AT DIFFERENT TYPES,
   and whichever file is [Require Import]ed second shadows the other.  Every
   occurrence below is written QUALIFIED for that reason, and [fw_max_bridge]
   is the one place the two are related.  An unqualified [FW_MAX] in the walk
   will typecheck in some goals and fail in others with a [nat]-vs-[Z]
   mismatch that reads like a coercion problem.

   THE RESUME POINT AS OF S3p (kept because the S3q walk below follows it
   line for line, and the loop half of it is still the frontier):
   the walk itself, in [ProofFileread.v]'s shape --
   dispatch (!writable pre-prologue -> -1; FD_PIPE; FD_DEVICE via [fw_devidx]
   and the assumed contract at the [c.jalr]; the +0x11e ELSE = [fw_panic]),
   then the FD_INODE loop.  Per iteration: begin_op -> ilock at [s/2] ->
   re-park ([ity_shot_agree] pins the type, [dir_ok_not_dir] makes dir_ok
   vacuous, S3i's two preservations close [inode_ok] 5/7) -> the COUNTED
   [wp_writei_sconf] at [ncount := MAXOPBLOCKS] with [fw_budget_ok] as the
   premise -> the [f->off] update ([off_checkout]/[off_checkin], fileread's
   choreography) -> iunlock -> [fw_shr_regen] -> end_op -> break/continue.
   The three join paths are one shape and are already [fw_tail]; the hoisted
   zero-trip test at +0x32 skips the loop AND the five spills, which is why
   [fw_epi] takes those slots as arbitrary words.

   S3o's LEAF TABLE, checked instruction by instruction against
   [CodeFilewrite.v]'s 118 AST lemmas and against the [wp_*_s_sconf] family
   as it actually exists.  Every branch displacement below was evaluated,
   not copied from the S3g graph; three of them are compressed-vs-full traps
   of the kind S3g's own trap 4 records, and one ([+0xd8]) is a NEGATIVE
   21-bit field that reads positive if the sign extension is skipped.

   [Local Lemma] with a [wi_cont]-style packaged continuation, [revert
   CID0; induction W as [| W IH]] over a FUEL, and the fuel is [n - i]
   (S3g's ledger; the chunk count would need [fw_chunk_cap]'s division and
   buys nothing).  NOT ireclaim's hart-closed wand: the back edge at +0xc8
   re-enters at +0xcc with a DIFFERENT [i], so the invariant has to be
   universally quantified over the loop-carried values, which is exactly
   what the [∀]-fuel shape gives and what a [□]-tail does not.  [fw_tail]

   [c.li s8,1] at +0x50 and [c.mv a1,s8] at +0x9a put 1 in a1, so writei's
   [eq_vec (m !!! Ra1) zero_reg = negb user] forces [user = true]; on that
   arm SpecWritei's source premise is now [proc_priv] AND NOTHING ELSE,
   which is exactly what [wp_filewrite_sconf_body] hands the walk.  Before
   S3p the same call also demanded [p_pid pj ↦₄{dq} pidv] alongside, and
   that conjunction was FALSE for any holder of [proc_priv] (the accessor is
   a borrow and the cell totals one) -- the walk could not be started.

   Stated with the [if] unreduced, and at a universally quantified [dq] and
   buffer, so that it is a discharge of the premise AS WRITTEN rather than
   of a hand-reduced paraphrase of it: if SpecWritei's bracket ever changes

  (* [ProofFilewriteParts.fw_tail] VERBATIM -- same block, same six
     restores, same [fw_epi] -- with its post's disjunction KEYED on the
     compare the block itself performs:

       (iz = nz /\ rv = nz)  \/  (iz <> nz /\ rv = -1)

     instead of [rv = -1 \/ (iz = nz /\ rv = nz)].  The landed form is
     enough for [filewrite_ret] (both disjuncts are inside it) but NOT for
     an ARMED post: at the exhausted exit [iz = nz] holds and the landed
     disjunction still permits [-1], which is the one return value the ok
     arm cannot carry.  Both branches prove the sharper form for free --
     the equal branch already proved [iz = nz], and the other has
     [(nz =? iz) = false] in hand.  R10: ProofFilewriteParts does not move;
     this is the parallel form, and the two proofs are diffable. *)

       [FsAbsWriteFire.wrf_awrite_fire] IS [ireg_top_retag_*] with the
       caller's two phases on either side of the [ghost_map_update], inside
       the ONE [ftopN] critical section -- so the chunk's commit and the
       row's move are one instant.  It is taken on the ONE KEY [rz = c]:
       the chunk was full, so writei's disturbed tail is empty and the
       bytes ARE the splice.  [wri_pre]'s other side condition,
       [f->off <= ip->size], is not a second key -- writei's success arm
       reports it and [Hsucc] hands it over (file header, difference 4).

       OFF THE KEY THE ROW STILL MOVES (round E2, lane E2-W; ruling Q-i).
       A chunk that stopped short landed the bytes it COUNTED plus the
       visible part of writei's disturbed tail ([FsAbsWriteFire.wrf_landed]),
       so it spends the chain's PARTIAL arm -- a two-phase fire like the
       full one, receipt and all, differing only in that [f->off] advances
       by the count rather than by the run.  Two cases spend no node and
       are honestly [_same]: writei's [-1] (nothing ran) and a chunk that
       landed nothing at all.  The tag below records which, for the exits.

       THE OFFSET HALF comes out of every case at the word [fw_offupd]
       left in the cell ([Hv2]), which is what the checkin re-forms the
       resident cell from ([FileOffCell.off_resident_of]). *)

             used to be free (the mono-list unit) and the chain is not, so

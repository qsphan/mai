(* InodeRegion.v -- THE INODE REGION: the dinode blocks' owner, and the
   per-inum fragment that replaces the coarse whole-block premise in every
   inode-layer contract.  Design: claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md, §11-§12.

   [FsBlocks.fsblock] is the write permission for a block, and a dinode
   block holds SIXTEEN inodes -- so any contract that takes the block's
   half for the duration of a call is unsatisfiable by two lock holders in
   the same block (§11.1).  The fix is a CHANGE OF GRANULARITY: callers
   hold [dinode_at γi inum dn], an exclusive per-inum ghost_map fragment,
   and the block halves never leave this region's invariant.

   ---- WHY THERE IS NO CHECKED-OUT ARM (§12) ----------------------------

   The first design (§11.4) had iupdate checking the block's half OUT of
   the region across its log_write and parking it back after.  That escrow
   cannot state its checked-out arm: during the window the thread's own
   log_write footprint ([bio_held] + the client half) holds EVERY per-block
   exclusive resource -- [disk_block] in full, both [fs_cache] halves, the
   machinery dirty half -- so by conservation the arm has nothing to hold,
   and a checkout could never prove the arm is parked.

   So the region is ONE-ARMED, and the only moment the client half leaves
   it is log_write's own ghost step (ProofLogWrite.v's [fsblock_update], a
   single [iMod] between two instruction dispatches, at mask ⊤).
   [ireg_write_au] below is the atomic update iupdate hands to the
   generalized SpecLogWrite premise: it opens the region THERE, lets
   [fsblock_update] run against the withdrawn run, and re-parks the block
   at the new bytes while retagging the caller's [dinode_at] in the same
   opening.  [ireg_read] is ilock's side: one mask-preserving opening in
   which the caller's payload machinery half pins the region's bytes and
   the coupling turns its [dinode_at] into [ds !!! islot inum = dn] --
   which is how [SpecIlock]'s "vv = false -> ds !!! islot inum = dn"
   premise stops being expressible rather than getting discharged (§11.3).

   ---- THE COUPLING, AND ONE NEW PURE FACT ------------------------------

   The invariant holds the ghost map's authority beside the block halves,
   with a pure coupling: slot [i] of block [bi]'s parked list IS the map's
   value at inum [16*bi + i].  Re-establishing the coupling after a write
   needs to know the parked list has not moved between iupdate's bread
   (where the caller learns [ds]) and its log_write (where the region is
   opened again).  Nothing the thread holds pins the LIST -- only its
   BYTES, via the machinery half riding in the thread's own payload -- so
   the bridge is [diblk_bytes_inj]: the encoding is injective on
   well-formed lists (§12.3).  Proved here from [bv_eq_of_bytes].

   ---- WHO HOLDS A FREE INUM'S FRAGMENT (§16.3/§16.4) --------------------

   Until §16 a free inum's [dinode_at] lived in the pool row's
   free arm, i.e. behind the itable spinlock -- and ialloc, whose claim is
   serialised by the BUFFER and by nothing else, can never hold that lock.
   So the free arm's fragment moved IN HERE: [ireg_slot] below is the
   per-slot arm, and it holds the record fragment exactly when the record is
   free OR freshly claimed ([fresh_shape]), and the per-inum MARKER
   ([imark]) otherwise.  Exactly one of the two is inside the invariant at
   any time and the other is outside; the marker is what the pool's free arm
   and a marker-parked cache entry now carry.

   That gives four arm moves rather than one:

     [ireg_write_au]  an ordinary flush -- fragment stays out, marker stays
                      in; hence the [di_type dn' <> 0] premise.
     [ireg_claim_au]  ialloc -- retag a type-0 record to a [fresh_shape]
                      one with NO caller resource at all.  This is §16.4's
                      claim box: the fragment never leaves the invariant, so
                      no interleaving can strand a concurrent fill.
     the FREE          iput's [ip->type = 0; iupdate] -- absorb the fragment,
                      pay out the marker.  It lives ABOVE this file, as
                      [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au]: the off-lock
                      deposit is the only type-0 write the reordered kernel
                      has, and it needs the escrow beside the region.
     [ireg_withdraw]  ilock's FIRST fill of a claimed inum -- deposit the
                      marker, take the fragment.  The marker is what makes
                      that case analysis exhaustive.

   ---- AND TWO MORE, FOR THE COUNT (§20.6, fs-sysfile S5f) --------------

     [ireg_write_link_reg]   mkdir's [".."] and sys_link's [ip->nlink++]:
                          mint the TYPE REGISTER's fragments in the SAME
                          ghost step as the count that pays for them
                          (fs-state.md §6½ -- the count IS the fragment
                          count).
     [ireg_write_unlink_reg] sys_unlink's [ip->nlink--], the ONLY nlink-
                          LOWERING region write in the kernel: it CONSUMES
                          them as it lowers.  That is precisely why
                          the ordinary flush may demand [di_nlink_stable]
                          -- the one writer that would violate it does not
                          go through the ordinary flush at all.

   THE SURVIVING CLAUSES ARE (L3)/(L4)/(L5), stated in [ireg_link_ok] below
   and re-established by all six arm moves.  Since durable-disk lane G's
   slice 6b their ONE remaining payoff is [ireg_link_ok_free] ("at the
   instant an inode is freed nothing names it"), which is what makes the
   claim mover's collapse of the [wl+wdu+wdt] sum legal; the old
   [ireg_link_ok_alloc] / [ireg_link_alloc] pair ("an outstanding fragment
   means an ALLOCATED record") is gone, its readings now taken off the
   counting RA ([ireg_lnk_tok_nz], [IgetLic]'s licence (a),
   [IregLinkNz.ireg_tok_nz]).  What is still NOT stated is §20.2's (L2) and the
   [c = None] half of (L3): nothing mints an [iclaim] yet, and the free
   cannot re-establish [c = None] without consuming one -- see
   [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au]'s note and design §20.15.

   ---- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ------------------------------------

   The boot-time allocation (building the initial map from the mkfs
   image's dinode blocks and minting every [dinode_at]) is fsinit wiring
   and lives in [IcacheBoot.v], not here.  The icache pool that HOLDS the
   fragments of uncached inodes is IcacheInv's (design §10.4).            *)

(* Exactly what ialloc's [memset(dip, 0, 64)] followed by
   [dip->type = type] leaves on disk: a nonzero type, a zero size, thirteen
   zero address words and a ZERO LINK COUNT.  ialloc writes NOTHING else --
   [nlink] stays 0 until the caller's own iupdate -- so this is deliberately
   the WEAKEST record shape a claim can promise, and it is still enough for
   ilock's fill to build [InodeLock.inode_ok] out of nothing at all

   and [DirView.dir_ok_size_zero] ride on the zero size).

(* ---- THE TWO IN-TRANSITION PINS (iclaim-ledger.md §2.3/§2.4) ---------

   THE CLAIM PIN (§2.4).  A claimed slot's record IS the claim box ialloc
   wrote -- [fresh_shape], hence [di_nlink = 0] and a nonzero type.  Two
   things read it: [ireg_claim_au] refutes a STANDING claim with it (its
   caller's buffer showed [di_type = 0], and [fresh_shape]'s first conjunct
   says otherwise), which is what makes the c-mint's [c = None] side
   condition dischargeable at all; and the create_fresh_ty payout (§2.8
   item 7) withdraws the pinned shape at the fill.

   IT IS THE ARM THAT KEEPS IT TRUE, not the byte movers.  §2.4's "writes
   cannot dent the pin" is the observation that every byte-writing mover
   consumes the caller's [dinode_at] and therefore runs at the MARKED arm,
   where the slot's own clause ([ireg_marked_ok] below) says [c = None] --
   so [ireg_write_au], [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] and the two link movers re-establish
   the pin vacuously and none of them grows a premise.  The one mover that
   moves a slot from the claimed (IN) arm to the marked one is
   [ireg_withdraw], and that is exactly §2.4's spend site: it CONSUMES an
   [iclaim] and retires the column. *)
(* THE SECOND CONJUNCT (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, RULING A): a claimed box is
   NEVER frozen.  It is the ClaimL row's contradiction surface in
   [IgetLic.iname_not_frozen] -- the one licence whose refutation cannot go
   through the freeze pin's [nlink = 0] (a claim box has [nlink = 0] too, by
   [fresh_shape]) and must go through the c column instead.

   IT COSTS THE MOVERS NOTHING.  [ireg_claim_au] ESTABLISHES it: its
   [di_type (ds !!! islot inum) = 0] premise meets the freeze pin's type
   conjunct at the OLD record and forces [f = FrzOff] there
   ([ireg_frz_ok_ty0]), and the claim does not touch the f column.  Every
   byte mover runs at the MARKED arm ([c = None]) and owes nothing.  The two
   movers that DO step f -- [ireg_freeze_au]'s mint and the phase step --
   both hold the record and so also run at [c = None]; and the phase step is
   self-refuting anyway, since a standing [FrzPre] already contradicts this
   clause at [c = Some]. *)
(* THE THIRD CONJUNCT (iclaim-ledger.md §5.2(a), item 7b): the column
   carries the type [ialloc] claimed, and the pin says the box's record has
   it.  [ireg_claim_au] establishes it by construction (it mints at its own
   record's type); every other mover runs at [c = None] or at an unchanged
   record, so it carries.  Spelled [x = Excl (di_type d)] rather than as a
   match on [x] so that the landed [destruct c as [x |]] proofs do not have

(* ---- ilock's LICENCE INDEX (iclaim-ledger.md §5''''', RULING C') --------

   [wp_ilock_sconf] serves sixteen call sites and its fill has to discharge
   §16.4's claim-box arm at every one of them.  The index says WHICH of the
   three currencies the caller brought, and therefore which discharge the
   fill runs:

     [ClaimK ty]  ialloc's own claimant -- create's child fill, and the ONLY
                  site that can present the typed [iclaim].  SPENT, together
                  with the claim-flavoured provenance unit; the pair
                  CONVERTS into the plain unit and buys [di_type d = ty].
     [PlainK]     the twelve in-file-unit sites: the reference in the
                  caller's hand already carries [runit_plain], which the
                  claim pin's (R3) turns into [c = None] -- the box arm is
                  refuted and the unit goes straight back out.
     [ShotK ty]   the three fd sites (fileread/filewrite/filestat), which
                  can hold NO whole unit across the call (their payload is
                  behind a cancellable invariant).  The generation's own
                  persistent one-shot is what they have, and it refutes
                  ilock's UNCACHED arm outright.

   Three constructors rather than a triple disjunction for [ireg_link_pin]'s
   reason: the payout differs per arm, and a caller that presented one must
   not have to case on the other two to read its own post. *)
(* [ClaimK] NAMES THE CLAIMING TRANSACTION (durable-disk C-5): the share
   [t |->[ln_tx icfg_log]{#q} tt] that [ireg_claim_au] parked in the region
   for the length of the claim box comes back at the fill, and it has to
   come back at exactly the pair that went in -- two halves of one element
   are not the whole.  The pair rides in the c
   column's own value, so the claimant's [IcacheRef.iclaim] fragment names
   it and [ireg_wd_back]'s claim arm is what hands it back. *)

(* ---- THE REFERENCE-PROVENANCE CLAUSE (iclaim-ledger.md §5', RULING R) ---

   THE r COLUMN's PIN, and the reason item 7a exists.  §5'.2 rules that every
   icache reference carries one FLAVOURED provenance unit ([IcacheRef.runit],
   [runit_claim] / [runit_plain]) for its whole life, and that a claim box
   carries no PLAINLY-licenced reference:

       (R1)  r + rc <= n          the units COUNT the in-core references
       (R2)  di_type d = 0  ->  r = 0 /\ rc = 0
       (R3)  c <> None      ->  r = 0                     <-- THE PIN

   (R3) IS WHAT §5'.3's DISJUNCTIVE WITHDRAW READS: a caller that presents its
   own [runit_plain] forces [1 <= r] ([IcacheRef.link_runit_ge]) and (R3)'s
   contrapositive then DERIVES [c = None] -- so the fifteen non-create
   [wp_ilock_sconf] sites pay with the unit their reference already carries,
   the marked arm's [ireg_marked_ok] holds, and nothing retires.

   WHY (R1) AND (R2) ARE HERE TOO -- THE DEVIATION FROM §5'.2, RECORDED.  The
   ruling's establish route for (R3) was "the standing pin [type = 0 -> r = 0]"
   at [ireg_claim_au].  THERE IS NO SUCH STANDING CLAUSE ON THE LANE: [r] rode
   the ledger entirely unconstrained (its charter at [IcacheRef.v:296] has zero
   consumers).  It is (R2), and (R2) is only PRESERVABLE with (R1) beside it:
   the one mover that writes a zero type is [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au], which holds
   [ifreeze_post] and therefore [n = 0] by the freeze pin -- and (R1) turns
   that into [r = rc = 0].  So the ruling's "all units die at the free's
   count-0" is exactly (R1), stated.  The three conjuncts are ONE predicate so
   that [ireg_slot]'s pure block grows by one clause and not three.

   THE COST TO THE MOVERS, ARM BY ARM.  (R1) moves only where BOTH a unit and
   the count move, which is every count mover by construction (iget's two
   up-counts and idup mint, iput's two closes spend).  (R2) is stable at every
   type-preserving flush, vacuous at [ireg_claim_au] (a [fresh_shape] record
   has a nonzero type) and paid at [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] as above.  (R3) is vacuous
   at [c = None], established at [ireg_claim_au] from (R2) at the OLD (type-0)
   record, and preserved at the plain mint by [IgetLic.iname_not_claimed] --
   the §2.6-pattern table lemma, twin of the landed [iname_not_frozen]. *)

   ([ireg_frz_ok_nz]) then refutes frozen outright -- one premise, in hand at
   its one raising site.  [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] writes [di_type = 0] over a frozen
   slot, which is exactly iput's own free: it now TAKES [ifreeze_post] and
   RETIRES it in the same move, so the [FrzPost] arm dissolves as the type
   goes to zero.  Every other arm mover re-establishes the pin for free
   (§3.1's cost table).

   [None] IS NOW REFUTED, not vacuous.  Boot mints [Some (Excl FrzOff)] at
   every slot ([IcacheBoot.icache_boot]) and every mover steps the column
   [Some -> Some], so "the f column is present" is a free invariant -- and it
   is what lets the licence table conclude the DESIGN's [f = Some (Excl
   FrzOff)] rather than a two-way disjunction every consumer would have to
   case on. *)
(* ---- THE FREEZE MIRROR's CLAUSE (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, RULING A⁗) ----

   The pure half of [ireg_frzc] below: the region's mirror bit READS the f
   column.  Both directions are used, and by the same reader from opposite
   ends: (→) is what makes the mint's [false] half refute "someone else is
   already freezing this inum" (S1a), (←) is what makes the freezer's
   [ifreeze_pre] force [islot2]'s arm onto its frozen-park disjunct at
   iput+0x8a (S1b) and what kills a foreign idup at a [FrzPre] inum (2.6b).

   Re-establishing it costs nothing at any mover that does not step f, and at
   the three that do it is derivable from the old clause alone: the mint flips
   [false -> true] with both halves in hand, the [FrzPre -> FrzPost] step flips
   back, and the retire ([FrzPost -> FrzOff]) reads [b = false] off the old
   clause and keeps it. *)
(* RULING G' (iclaim-ledger.md §6''): stated at [frz_preb] rather than at the
   equation [f = Some (Excl FrzPre)], which no longer determines the column
   now that the phase carries the regime index.  The clause is exactly the
   same fact; every consumer discharges it by [reflexivity] at a concrete
   column where it used to say [discriminate]. *)

(* NLINK STABILITY (fs-icache.md §20.6's "ordinary iupdate" and "iput's
   free" rows, fs-sysfile S5f).  The link ledger's (L1) clause caps the
   count of live directory records naming an inum by that inum's [nlink],
   and (L3) says a FREE record's [nlink] is zero -- so the region can only
   re-establish both across a flush if the flush is told two things about
   the record it writes:

     the FIRST conjunct -- [nlink] does not MOVE.  Without it any holder
     of [dinode_at] could lower [nlink] under an outstanding register
     fragment; with it, "a fragment outstanding implies [nlink >= 1]" is a
     theorem of the region rather than a survey of this tree's callers.  It is an EQUALITY and not "does not fall", because
     that is what every discharge site in the tree actually has: no writer
     that goes through the ordinary flush moves [nlink] at all, so
     [di_nlink_stable_refl] / [di_nlink_stable_free] take the equation as
     input already and the two consumers below become rewrites.
     sys_unlink's decrement is the ONE writer that moves an [nlink], and it
     does not go through the ordinary flush at all -- it goes through
     [ireg_write_unlink], which pays for the drop by CONSUMING a fragment.

     the SECOND conjunct -- a flush that CLEARS the type leaves [nlink]
     at zero.  That is iput's free path, whose C-level guard is literally
     [ip->nlink == 0], and it is what lets [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] derive [w = 0]
     -- i.e. "a free inode is named by no live directory record" --
     INSIDE the region, with no caller obligation at all (§20.9(c)).

   NAMED for [di_type_stable]'s two reasons verbatim: it travels through
   [SpecIupdate]'s three bodies and every contract that holds the region's
   record at a stale index, and a raw [/\] in a [_body] premise list is
   elaborated in [bi_scope].

   BOTH CONJUNCTS ARE NOW STATED (fs-sysfile S5g).  S5f landed the first
   one alone and this comment describing two, because the second was not
   dischargeable anywhere: iput's free path is its only non-vacuous
   instance, and iput's proof had lost the record it reads [ip->nlink]
   off.  §20.14's (R1) -- [IcacheEscrow.ic_open_held] made
   record-parametric -- restores it, and the second conjunct is what
   carries the C-level [ip->nlink == 0] guard into the region, where
   (L3) turns it into "a free inode is named by no live directory
   record".  It costs THREE discharge sites in the whole tree; every
   contract that merely carries the premise is untouched. *)

   EQUALITY, so [ireg_write_au] carries (L1) by rewriting.  What is left
   here is the LINK/UNLINK arithmetic, where [nlink] really does move. *)

(* ---- THE ROOT INUM, AT THE REGION'S OWN KEY TYPE -----------------------

   THE INUM IS A LITERAL at the region's own key type, for the reason
   [ireg_link_ok]'s 32767 and [ireg_bi]'s 16 are: [InodeInv.ROOTINO] is
   [mword_of_int 1 : mword 32] and [bv_unsigned] of it is this number, but
   importing [InodeInv] would put the whole in-core inode geometry (and
   [Kernel.KernelSyms]) underneath a file 350 dependents deep.  The bridge
   is [IregLinkNz.ireg_root_ROOTINO], one [reflexivity].

   WHAT IT IS FOR.  "The root is allocated, and stays allocated" is a
   reading of the COUNTING RA, not of a maintained pure clause: the region
   parks one unspendable keep-alive token at this inum ([ireg_keep]), and
   [ireg_lnk_root_alive] / [ireg_lnk_root_min2] read the root's minimum off
   [FsStateLink.link_auth_toks_le].  Nothing else needs the constant.

(* ---- (L4)'s ARITHMETIC, AND THE SIGNED/UNSIGNED CATCH IT EXISTS FOR ----

   xv6 117c0e7 guards both nlink-raising sites with [>= NLINK_MAX], which
   gcc compiles to [== 32767] because [nlink] is a SIGNED short and it knows
   the range.  The ledger's premise is UNSIGNED, and the two differ at
   [bv_unsigned = 65535] -- signed [-1] -- where the guard passes and the
   sixteen-bit [++] still wraps to zero.  So the guard alone does NOT close
   the increment ([ProofCreateParts.cr_nlink_guard_leaves_the_wrap] is the
   witness); what closes it is (L4), the range fact that a link count is a
   NON-NEGATIVE short, and the guard is exactly what makes (L4)
   PRESERVABLE.  That is what the kernel fix bought, and it is why (L4) is
   an INVARIANT and not a premise: no caller can name the record it is
   about (fs-sysfile.md's eleventh stop, the "no name for dp" objection).

   [ireg_nlink_bump] is stated as a CONJUNCTION on purpose: the first half
   is what [ireg_write_link] owes the ledger and the second is what it owes

  (* THE PER-INUM RECORD CLAUSES (design §20.2's (L1)/(L3)).

     (L1) [w <= di_nlink d] IS GONE with the ledger column [w] it bounded
     (lane G6, fs-state.md §6½).  Its contrapositive was the whole point --
     an outstanding ticket forced [di_nlink >= 1] at the record the REGION
     holds -- and the type register says it directly instead
     ([FsStateLink.link_auth_toks_le] at [ireg_lnk], read by
     [IregLinkNz.ireg_tok_nz]).  (L3) still forces a nonzero TYPE from
     there, so "a reference implies an allocated inode" is unchanged.

     (L3) [di_type d = 0 -> di_nlink d = 0] -- a free record's link count
     is zero, which is what made (L1) collapse to [w = 0] there:
     **a free inode is named by no live directory record**, proved inside
     the region with no caller obligation at all.

     WHY THE CLAUSES ARE STATED HERE AND NOT AT THE PAYLOAD.  [d] is the
     ON-DISK record -- [ireg_couple] pins it to the parked block's bytes on
     BOTH arms -- so (L1) can be stated whether or not the fragment is
     checked out.  Park the authority with the record instead ([ic_loaded] /
     [ipool_alloc]) and the cap is stranded at every checkout: the ordinary
     fill would have to re-establish [w <= nlink] for a claim box
     ([nlink = 0]) and could not.  §20.9(c)/(d).

     THE KNOT THAT HELD THEM BACK, AND WHAT UNTIED IT (fs-sysfile S5f/S5g).
     (L1) and (L3) stand or fall together and their joint discharge lands
     on `ProofIput`:

       * [ireg_claim_au] must re-establish (L1) at the record ialloc
         writes, whose [nlink] is ZERO ([SpecIalloc.ialloc_fresh] models
         [memset(dip,0,64)]).  So it must show [w = 0] at the slot it
         claims, and its only handle is the type-0-ness its caller read out
         of the buffer -- i.e. it needs exactly (L3), "a free record's link
         count is zero", as an invariant.  ialloc never reads [nlink] and
         cannot supply it as a premise.
       * (L3) is preserved by every writer but ONE: the flush that CLEARS a
         type, i.e. iput's free path, which must show [di_nlink = 0] of the
         record it writes.  xv6 establishes exactly that -- the free is
         guarded by [ip->nlink == 0] at iput+0x40 -- but the PROOF used to
         lose it, re-opening the payload after [acquiresleep] as a FRESH
         existential with no link back to the record the halfword was read
         off.  [ity_shot] pins the TYPE across that window and nothing
         pinned [nlink].
       * and there is no ghost way round it: the ledger's authority may
         only be lowered by a frame-preserving update, so nothing can
         "clear" [w] for a record whose fragments are outstanding
         (§19.7's rule again).

     §20.14's (R1) supplies the missing fact at its source rather than
     working round it: [IcacheEscrow.ic_open_held] is record-parametric, so
     iput's free path carries its own [dn] across the sleeplock window, and
     [di_nlink_stable]'s second conjunct -- which this file always
     documented and S5f could not state -- carries the zero into
     [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au].  Both clauses then land with no caller obligation
     anywhere and no signature move: the six arm moves below each
     re-establish [ireg_link_ok] from what they already have.

     WHAT IS STILL NOT HERE: §20.2's (L2) [c <> None -> fresh_shape d] and
     the [c = None] half of (L3).  Neither is blocked by this knot; both
     wait on the CLAIM being minted at all, which is §20.5/§20.7's (M1)
     work -- the free cannot re-establish [c = None] without CONSUMING an
     [iclaim] it does not hold, and until something mints one there is
     nothing for a clause to say.  The [c] component rides unconstrained
     through every mover below, exactly as it did before.

     (L4) [di_nlink d <= 32767] -- a link count is a NON-NEGATIVE short.
     The clause the mkdir arm's [dp->nlink++] turned out to need and the
     twelfth stop found missing: xv6's guard is a SIGNED test and
     [wp_iupdate_link]'s premise is an unsigned one, so the guard alone
     leaves the wrap at 65535 (= signed -1) alive.  It is stated HERE for
     (L1)'s reason and one more: the record is the region's, and no caller
     can name it.  PRESERVATION is where the whole clause is paid for, and
     every arm move but one gets it free -- [di_nlink_stable] leaves the
     count alone, [fresh_shape] and the free write a zero, and the unlink
     LOWERS it.  The exception is [ireg_write_link], which is why that
     mover, alone of the six, takes a premise about the OLD count: the
     kernel's own guard, without which (L4) is not preservable at all. *)
  (* (L5) THE TYPE IS ONE OF THE FOUR (durable-disk 2b-inode-3).  It is
     [FsStateInode.inode_local]'s [inl_type], and it has no other producer:
     2b-inode-2 recorded it as coming from [ireg_wd_ty] "on the marker
     fill", which is FALSE as landed -- [ireg_wd_ty (ClaimK ty) d] is
     [di_type d = ty] with [ty] unconstrained, and at [PlainK] it is
     [True].  So the REGION is where it has to be maintained: it is the
     record's home, the image satisfies it ([FsImg.fio_type] at a live
     inode, type 0 at a free one) and every kernel writer writes one of the
     four.  Stated as a fourth clause of THIS predicate rather than as a
     new conjunct of [ireg_slot] because the six arm moves already
     re-establish [ireg_link_ok] of their new record, so nothing
     destructures differently and no [iSplitR] moves.  It is what makes
     [ireg_withdraw] able to pay [inode_local] at the claim box. *)
  (* LANE G6 DELETED (L1) [w <= di_nlink d] with the ledger column [w] it
     bounded (fs-state.md §6½): link counts are the type register's own

     sound is that the zero it may now find was written AFTER the
     observation, hence inside the observer's still-live op -- whose epoch
     is frozen, commit requiring [out = 0] -- hence at the observer's own
     epoch, so [LogInv.log_use_group] turns the witness into membership of
     THIS batch's header.  §G.3 put the receipt on the icache's parked
     payload and §G.16 gated it on a per-generation one-shot; both are dead
     (§G.17): checkout and park are DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS, so the resource
     would have to cross through every caller holding a locked inode, and
     while a slot is checked out the escrow cannot name the record at all.
     The region can, always: [ireg_slot] HOLDS the record, [dinode_at] is

     §2.3's last conjunct used to read [⌜f = FrzOff⌝ ∨ ireg_open ∨ ireg_boot]:
     "whoever froze this inum exhibited SOME regime".  That is enough to keep
     ireclaim's boot token out of a runtime freeze window, but NOT enough to
     give it back: the off-lock deposit could only ever return the un-indexed
     disjunction, and ireclaim -- having lent its only [ireg_boot] -- has
     nothing left to refute the left arm with.  Since the phase now REMEMBERS
     the arm ([frz]'s payload), the clause can be stated at the index, and the
     deposit's agreement with the walk's [ifreeze_post rg] token selects it. *)
  (* ---- THE CORPSE WINDOW'S PARKED SHARE (durable-disk C-6, [FsCollect.v]'s
     residue (F)) -----------------------------------------------------------

     iput's free path leaves the region slot on the MARKED sub-arm -- [imark]
     and NO record fragment -- from the eviction that hands
     [IcacheEscrow.ipool_evict_lend] its share all the way to
     [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au].  Across that window the inum has no
     bundle ANYWHERE, so the commit's collection cannot reach it, and nothing
     in [ireg_slot] used to distinguish the corpse from an ordinary
     checked-out inode: the f column's clause was the REGIME alone, a
     persistent [IcacheRefDefs.ireg_open] at the runtime index, which an empty
     [LogDefs.ln_tx] authority cannot touch ([FsCollect.col_corpse_not_refuted]
     was that wall).

     THE WINDOW IS INSIDE ONE TRANSACTION -- iput runs between its caller's
     [begin_op] and [end_op] and holds a share of its token (durable-disk
     B''-tx5) -- so the freeze PARKS a positive share of it beside the regime,
     for exactly the window's length: [ireg_freeze_au] takes it at the mint,
     the [FrzPre -> FrzPost] step rides it through ([ireg_fsh_step], which
     moves the phase and not the index), and [ireg_free_deposit_au] returns it
     with the regime.  At a commit the WAL's authority for that map is empty,
     so [ireg_fsh_no_ops] reads [f = FrzOff] off the clause at EVERY slot.

     It is [ireg_cpin]'s device at the f column, and the pair sits in the
     phase's own INDEX because two halves of one element are not the whole
     -- iput's spec names [(tid, q)] and must get THAT element back,
     and an existentially-keyed share cannot be re-identified.  The index is
     where the freezer's own [IcacheRef.ifreeze_pre] / [ifreeze_post] fragment
     already re-identifies it, so no new ghost and no new column. *)

     fifteen that actually MOVE it (the link movers, the claim, the withdraw,
     the free, and [IcacheInv]'s count writes) unpack -- which is exactly the
     set that owes the clause a re-establishment anyway. *)
  (* ---- WHERE (R1)/(R2)/(R3) WILL BE PARKED, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT YET ----

     THE CONJUNCT THIS BUNDLE EXISTS TO CARRY IS

         ∗ ⌜ireg_ref_ok r rc n c d⌝

     and adding it is a ONE-LINE change here.  It is NOT in yet, and the
     reason is a finding this increment establishes rather than a choice:

       (R1) [r + rc <= n] COUPLES THE UNITS TO THE IN-CORE COUNT, and it has
       to -- §5'.2's establish route for the pin runs [ireg_claim_au] <- (R2)
       <- [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] <- "the count is zero", and (R1) is the only thing
       that carries a zero count to a zero unit column.  Every alternative was
       probed and refuted: a fragment can force a column UP, never to zero, so
       no premise and no token on the free can replace it; a [FrzPost]-gated
       (R1) has to be established at [ireg_freeze_au], which has nothing to
       establish it with; and a csum-flavoured c/r cell makes [iclaim] and
       [runit_plain] collide at the FRAGMENTS but moves the same obligation
       onto [link_mint_claim]'s local update, unchanged.

       AND (R1) IS EXACTLY WHAT THE FOUR COUNT ACCESSORS IN [IcacheInv] MUST
       PAY.  [ireg_icnt_acc] / [_frz_acc] / [_lic_acc] / [_mir_acc] all hand
       out [∀ m, ... icnt_half m] -- an arbitrary new count -- so with (R1)
       parked each of them must move a unit in the same step, which is the
       mint/spend wiring of §5'.4's item 7a: the two up-count AUs, idup's, and
       iput's two closes, then [SpecIget]/[SpecIdup]/[SpecIput] and the rest
       homes.  Landing (R1) WITHOUT that wiring cannot be done: it is not that
       the proofs get harder, it is that [ireg_icnt_acc]'s contract becomes
       false.

     THE STAGING WAS: 7a-core landed the flavoured column, its per-flavour
     moves, the pure clause with every preservation lemma the movers cite,
     and [IgetLic.iname_mint_ok] -- the licence table that pays the mint's
     two side conditions.  ITEM 7a-wire (this increment) TURNS THE CONJUNCT
     ON, in the one line below, and threads the units through every
     reference's lifetime: minted at iget, copied at idup, spent at iput,
     resting in [FileInv]'s fd slot and the proc invariant's [p->cwd]. *)

  (*  THE LINK-COUNTING RA's PER-INUM AUTHORITY (durable-disk 2b-inode-4) *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (*  [fs-state.md] section 2's counting RA, filed HERE and not in the
      checked-out payload.  The authority mirrors a record FIELD
      ([di_nlink]), so 2b-inode-1's ruling (i) puts it exactly where the
      record's own bytes are: region-side, total over the slot, tied to
      [d] BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a clause.

      TWO THINGS FORCE IT and neither is a placement preference:

      - [IgetLic]'s licence (a) reads "a directory record names this inum
        and PAYS for it" into "the target is ALLOCATED", and that reading
        is the RA's own law ([FsStateLink.link_auth_toks_le]) applied at
        the TARGET's authority.  The presenter does not hold the target,
        so with the authority in the target's payload nothing in the tree
        could reach it and [SpecIget]'s premise would have no discharge.
        Region-side it is one [inv_acc] of [iregN] -- exactly where the
        pure clause (L1) it replaces was read.
      - every move of a count is a FLUSH, which already opens the region
        to write the record; [link_mint]/[link_return] are basic updates,
        so they compose into that AU at no mask cost.

      AT THIS STAGE EVERY TOKEN IS AT HOME.  The pile is [nlink] tokens
      wide, so the family's validity is free at boot and no image sweep is
      spent; the links step hands a directory's tokens to its checked-out
      payload ([FsStateInode.ent_toks]) and leaves the region holding only
      the ROOT's keep-alive token. *)

  (* THE BYTE VIEW'S ROW, AS THE REGION SEES IT (durable-disk 1c-flip
     step 3).  [ireg_blk] above now holds the EXCLUSIVE byte run
     [fsblock (fs_bytes γfs)] instead of the cache's parked half, so the
     auth-free half/half agreement every reader used to close by
     entailment is gone: a reader opens [fs_bytes_inv] instead, and to do
     that it needs the invariant AND the fact that its block is one of the
     home blocks the invariant covers.

     THE HOME SET IS BOUND HERE, NOT A PARAMETER OF [ireg_inv], AND THAT
     IS A DELIBERATE DEVIATION from the flip's ruling (2) -- see
     claude-notes/projects/durable-disk.md item 1c.  Measured before
     deviating: [ireg_inv] appears in the STATEMENT of 203 definitions
     across 74 files, nearly all of them syscall-level contracts
     ([SpecSysOpen.wp_sys_open_frame], [KexecDefs.fs_fabric],
     [FsSyscalls.fs_world_all]) that have no business naming the block
     layer's home set and no way to obtain one; IcacheRef.v's own header
     already records that "[ireg_inv], whose arity is fixed by 30-odd fs
     contracts" is why the icfg class exists.  Threading a [gset Z]
     through all of them is the leak fs-state.md §0 forbids.

     NOTHING IS WEAKENED BY BINDING IT HERE.  The set is a [gset Z], not
     a ghost name (the ghost names ARE explicit: [fs_bytes γfs] and
     [fs_cache γfs]); the coverage clause pins everything the region can
     ever need of it -- every one of the region's own blocks is in it --
     and no consumer of the region ever mentions a home block that is not
     one of those.  A second invariant at [logN] over the same [fs_bytes
     γfs] cannot exist anyway: its body demands the byte map's AUTH, of
     which there is one. *)

  (* A CHECKED-OUT HOLDER CARRIES [FsState.top_frag] -- the era's abstract
     value of its inode, inside [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era] -- and a
     [ghost_map] element cannot be RETAGGED without its authority.  Every
     write in this kernel moves the node (a record write, a data block, a
     truncation), so a payload that could not retag would be immutable and
     no walk could re-park at its new value.  The authority therefore needs
     a home that a walk can reach at ANY instant.

     IT IS ITS OWN INVARIANT, NOT A CONJUNCT OF [ireg_body], for two
     reasons.  (i) A mover that has [iregN] OPEN -- every region write is
     one -- must still be able to retag; a conjunct inside the region's own
     body is unreachable there.  (ii) [ireg_body] is destructured at twenty
     accessors in this file and none of them has any business seeing the
     abstract map.  The handle rides in [ireg_inv] because that is the
     ambient FS credential every contract in the cone already carries
     (durable-notes: put a new ambient credential in the bundle the cone
     already threads).

     THE BODY IS UNTIED, AND SAYS SO.  Nothing here relates [I] to the
     bytes: stage 2c moves the whole [fs_view Γ_L] body into the log's
     parked payload, where the tie is the design's, and this invariant is
     retired with it.  What it provides in the meantime is exactly the
     UPDATE right the fragments need, which is sound at any [I]. *)

  (*  THE LOCKED REGISTRY (durable-disk lane A, plan section 4b)         *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* THE INVARIANT'S POINT, in one sentence: every inode the abstract map
     names is WELL-FORMED, except the ones some open transaction has said
     it is in the middle of writing.

     A transaction says so by ARMING: it hands its own transaction token
     over (it is parked here, [ftop_body]'s big-op) and takes back a
     receipt naming the inums whose row it has suspended.  It gets the
     token back by DISARMING, which is where it re-proves the row -- and
     that is free at the natural place, because a walk that re-packs its
     payload has [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era]'s [inode_local] in hand
     anyway.  So at a COMMIT, where no transaction is open at all, no
     token can be parked, no inum can be armed, and the row is
     [FsDurSnap.snap_local] of the whole map ([ireg_clean_acc]).

     WHY THE REGISTRY IS KEYED BY AN ARM ID.  An arm has to prove its key is
     not already taken, or the ghost map cannot grow.  Keyed by INUM that is
     exactly the fact nobody can produce -- "no other walk holds this inode"
     is the inode LOCK's property, and the lock is invisible here.  Keyed by
     TRANSACTION it costs the arming walk its WHOLE token, and a walk that
     has parked a SHARE of the same token elsewhere -- which is exactly what
     a transactional [ilock] does -- can then never arm at all.  So a walk
     arms BY SHARE and never by the whole token.  Keyed by an ARM ID
     it is free: the ghost step SEES the registry's own map, so
     [fresh (dom A)] is a key nobody holds, and the arm may then park ANY
     share.

     WHAT THE PARKED SHARE STILL BUYS is the one thing the commit reads off
     the registry: every entry holds a POSITIVE share of its transaction's
     [ln_tx] element, so an EMPTY [ln_tx] authority refutes every entry
     ([ireg_clean_acc]), which is all [IregClean.ireg_snap_local_acc] wants.
     And because the entry RECORDS the share, [ireg_release] hands back
     exactly what [ireg_arm] took, so a walk can recombine its token for
     [end_op].  The price is that a receipt carries a SET of inums rather
     than one, which costs the arming walk one more ghost step
     ([ireg_arm_more]) and nothing else. *)

  (* THE RETAG, ALONE.  A walk that has already moved the region's record
     proxy (iupdate did it, at the region's own AU) and only owes the
     abstract value takes this one; it opens [ftopN] and, through
     [AppInv.app_top_update], the application's [appN] -- the map's
     authority is split between the two (app-instances.md section 2), and
     an update needs the whole.

     IT CARRIES THE ROW (durable-disk lane A, plan section 4b): the new
     node has to be well-formed, because the map the walk is moving is the
     one a commit reads.  A walk whose write leaves the inode HALF-BUILT --
     create's mkdir child between its [nlink = 1] and its two dot entries,
     itrunc between the cleared pointers and the zeroed size -- takes
     [ireg_top_retag_armed_*] instead, having suspended the row first
     ([ireg_arm]).  The obligation is free at every other site: they
     re-establish exactly these facts to re-pack their payload anyway, and
     [FsStateEra.inode_local_of_ok_rec] is the one line that assembles
     them.

     ...AND THE APPLICATION'S CLAIM, in one of TWO FORMS (design/
     applications.md section 2): [_same] when the reading is unchanged
     ([FsAbsDefs.abs_of n = FsAbsDefs.abs_of n'], nothing from the
     application); [_step] with a step wand from the caller's contract (the
     AU fires: the process's own deposit pays it, and a generic slot's is
     paid off [AppInv.app_sup]).  There is no blanket form: every view
     move on a dispatched path is an AU fire or a [_step], and the only
     [_same] movers are the two that run between ABSENT rows -- ilock's
     fresh-inode fill and the escrow deposit's free, both of which read the
     pre-node's zero count off [ireg_top_park].  The general form, with the
     step under the later, is the one proof; the two are its readings. *)

  (*  THE FOUR ARM MOVES (§12.2 for the first, §16.3/§16.4 for the rest)  *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* Exactly the shape SpecLogWrite's generalized byte-run premise takes:
     the fupd opens the region and surrenders the block's client half at
     whatever the parked bytes are; log_write's own [fsblock_update]
     agreement (against the machinery half in the caller's handle) is what
     delivers [bsl' = diblk_bytes ds], and [diblk_bytes_inj] then pins the
     parked LIST to the [ds] the caller learned at its bread.  The closing
     wand takes the half back at the flushed bytes, retags the caller's
     [dinode_at] against the authority, and re-couples the block.

     THE TYPE PREMISE (§16.4).  Since §16.3 a FREE record's fragment lives
     in the invariant, so an unconditional payout would be wrong for a
     type-0 [dn']: the slot's arm has to flip and the marker has to come
     out.  That is [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au] below; this lemma keeps the arm where it
     is and therefore demands an allocated [dn'].  Every ordinary caller
     has it from [InodeLock.inode_ok].

     THE TYPE-STABILITY PREMISE (fs-icache.md §19.6 Part 1, fs-sysfile S5d).
     Before it, the only constraint on the flushed record's type was the
     nonzero-ness above, so ANY holder of [dinode_at γi inum dn] could
     RETYPE the inode and re-establish the invariant -- i.e. no-writer-
     retypes-an-allocated-inode was a fact about this tree's callers and
     not a theorem of the model, which is what §19.1(i) refuted.  With the
     disjunction below it IS a theorem of the region: a flush either clears
     the type (iput's [ip->type = 0], the LEFT disjunct -- and that route
     actually leaves through [EscrowDeposit.ireg_free_deposit_au], so here the left disjunct is
     dead against [Hnz] and only records the shape) or leaves it exactly
     where it was.  The premise only TRAVELS: the proof body does not move,
     and every caller in the tree discharges it today ([ProofWritei] and
     [ProofItrunc] from their own [wi_dinode]/size-only updates,
     [ProofCreate] from [ProofCreateParts.cr_setf], [ProofIput]'s free path
     at the left disjunct). *)

  (* The mirror of [ireg_write_au] with the fragment sourced FROM the
     invariant rather than supplied to it, and it needs NO caller resource
     at all: the buffer the caller is holding IS the serialiser (§16.2), so
     the only premise is the type-0 record the caller decoded out of it.
     The claim leaves the retagged fragment INSIDE the region, at the
     [fresh_shape] arm -- that is §16.4's claim box, and it is why the
     payout is trivial: nothing crosses to ialloc's caller, so no
     interleaving can strand a concurrent ilock's fill (§16.4's killing
     trace).  The FIRST fill of an entry for this inum picks the fragment up
     again with [ireg_withdraw].

     A claim against an ALREADY-CLAIMED slot is refuted PURELY: a claimed
     slot's record has [fresh_shape], hence a nonzero type, and the coupling
     says that record IS the one the caller's buffer decoded. *)

  (*  iput's FREEZE -- the f column's mint (iclaim-ledger.md §1.4/§2.3)   *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* WHERE IT FIRES.  In [ip_free_entry]'s span, on the [nlink == 0] arm at
     iput+0x50, still under the FIRST itable-lock hold -- which is where
     [Mt !! k = Some (q, 1)] is a live fact and where §2.2's [icnt] SLOT half
     therefore reads ONE.  Between this mint and the deposit's retire the
     freeze-pin is the walk's working capital: §1.1's B1 payout reads it at
     iput+0x82 and gets [cnt2 = 1] with no arithmetic side condition, and
     +0x8a steps the phase [FrzPre -> FrzPost] fragment-side, inside the
     region open it already takes for the count.

     WHY IT IS A SWAP AND NOT AN ALLOCATION, i.e. why the caller brings
     [ifreeze FrzOff] rather than nothing.  The mint must be EXCLUSIVE -- two
     threads must not both hold a freeze at one inum -- and a [None -> Some]
     allocation cannot be: nothing a RUNTIME freezer holds refutes a standing
     [FrzPre] (the boot arm's [ireg_boot] does, by [ity_pending_excl]; the
     persistent [ireg_open] does not), and the region has no other handle on
     it.  With the unfrozen state spelled as [FrzOff] the right to freeze IS
     the exclusive fragment, it rides under the itable lock beside the count
     half, and double-freeze dies on [Excl] alone -- see [Xv6Cameras.frz]'s
     header for the same argument from the algebra's side.

     THE BOOT-SHELTER SIDE (§2.3's last conjunct) is the caller's
     [ireg_open ∨ ireg_boot]: a runtime freezer hands in the persistent
     sealed regime, ireclaim PARKS its exclusive boot token for the window
     and takes it back at the deposit. *)
  (* THE RECORD PREMISES (iclaim-ledger.md §3.1, RULING A's mover table, last
     row).  The pin is a RECORD fact now, so its mint has to establish it:
     the freezer hands in the record it is freezing -- BORROWED, exactly like
     the block half beside it, and handed straight back -- together with the
     two facts the pin spells.  All three are in the walk's hand at
     [ip_free_entry]: the inode is locked, so [dinode_at] is checked out to
     iput; [nlink = 0] is the C-level [ip->nlink == 0] test it has just taken;
     and [type <> 0] is [InodeLock.inode_ok]'s own conjunct on a live locked
     inode.
     The fragment also does a SECOND job, and it is what pays for the claim
     clause: it refutes both non-marked arms ([dinode_at_excl]), so the slot
     is at [c = None] and the new [ireg_claim_ok] conjunct is vacuous at the
     phase this mover writes. *)

  (* B1's PIN READ (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, the +0x82 re-acquire).

     The freezer re-takes the itable lock at iput+0x82 and [islot2]'s live arm
     hands it [icnt_half z (Pos.to_nat cnt2)] -- about the map AS IT IS NOW,
     the REF-1 fact the caller supplied being about the map before the release

     count is ONE, so [cnt2 = 1] and the non-last-close arm is REFUTED rather

  (*  ilock's WITHDRAWAL (§16.4's [icb_withdraw])                          *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* The FIRST fill of an entry whose parked payload is a MARKER and whose
     buffer shows a nonzero type.  It is [ireg_read]'s opening -- the
     caller's machinery half pins the region's bytes -- with one arm move on
     top: the marker goes in, the claimed fragment comes out, and the map
     does not change at all.

     EXHAUSTIVENESS, which is what §16.4 needed the box for: the marker the
     caller holds refutes the OUT arm outright, so a nonzero type at this
     slot forces the claimed arm and delivers [fresh_shape] -- out of which
     [InodeLock.inode_ok] is constructible from nothing.  No itable lock and
     no entry-uniqueness argument is involved. *)
  (* ---- THE WITHDRAW's PREMISE, INDEXED (iclaim-ledger.md §5'.3) --------

     RULING R makes the withdraw's licence a DISJUNCTION -- create's fill
     presents the typed claim and spends it; every other fill presents the
     PLAIN provenance unit its own reference carries, borrowed and returned.
     Spelled as an INDEX rather than a [∨] for [ireg_link_pin]'s reason: the
     payout differs on the two arms (only the claimant learns the type, only
     the borrower gets its unit back), and a caller that presented one arm
     must not have to case on the other to read its own post.

     [ClaimK ty] is §5.2(a)'s claim arm; [PlainK] is §5'.3's plain arm, and
     the plain arm's [c = None] is DERIVED, not assumed -- the unit collides
     [1 <= r] against the claim pin's [c <> None -> r = 0].

     ---- RULING C' (iclaim-ledger.md §5''''): THE INDEX GOES 3-VALUED -----

     The landed [option (bv 16)] is RESHAPED into [ilkc], because the fd
     layer's three [wp_ilock_sconf] sites can present NEITHER arm: their
     inode payload lives behind a cancellable invariant that no syscall may
     hold open across the call, so no whole unit and no claim reaches them.
     What they DO hold, persistently and for free, is the generation's own
     one-shot [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot g ty] (FileInvDefs.inode_pay carries it) --
     and a one-shot in hand says the generation has ALREADY been filled, so
     it refutes the uncached arm outright ([IcacheRefDefs.ity_pending_shot_excl]
     at ilock's peel) and the fill never runs.  That is [ShotK].

     AND THE CLAIM ARM BECOMES A CONVERSION.  Under C' the claimant's own
     reference carries the CLAIM-flavoured unit ([runit_claim], minted by
     ialloc's [ClaimL] iget) rather than a plain one, and the withdraw takes
     BOTH it and the [iclaim]: it spends the [rc] column, mints the [r]
     column and retires [c], all in the one region open it already takes,
     and hands back [runit_plain] -- so the child reference leaves create's
     fill unit-carrying exactly as every other reference does, and the
     [1 <= n] the retire's arithmetic needs comes FREE off the LANDED (R1)
     [r + rc <= n].  (§5'''' RULING C's cbit inequality is refuted by
     machine-checked counterexample; this is its replacement.) *)

    | ShotK ty      => IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot g ty
    end.

  (* what comes BACK: the claim arm's pair CONVERTS into the plain unit, the
     plain unit is BORROWED and returned verbatim, and the one-shot is
     persistent so returning it costs nothing. *)
  (* ...AND THE CLAIM ARM CARRIES THE PARKED TRANSACTION SHARE BESIDE IT
     (durable-disk C-5).  The claim box parked [q] of transaction [t]'s
     [LogDefs.ln_tx] element for the length of the window ([ireg_cpin]) and
     the withdrawal is that window's EXIT, so the share comes home here --
     at the [(t, q)] the claimant's own [IcacheRef.iclaim] names, which is
     what makes it rejoinable with the residue create kept.  It rides
     INSIDE this payout rather than beside it (durable-notes, "REPLACING ONE
     CONJUNCT OF A BIG PAYLOAD BY ANOTHER"): the fifteen [PlainK]/[ShotK]
     call sites of [SpecIlock] are then byte-stable, and only create's
     [ClaimK] fill -- the one site that can be in the window at all --
     splits the pair. *)

     keeps and, beside it, EXACTLY [ireg_wd_lic (ClaimK ty)]: the licence
     create's fill presents to [wp_ilock_sconf].  So the receipt's three
     rows travel bundled and arrive already in the shape ilock asks for;
     nothing is proved here that the ClaimK arm did not already state.
     (The extra [lockG] binder is [IcacheRef.inode_ref]'s, not this
     lemma's: the reference's liveness slice is stated over the icache
     lock's ghost theory, and this section does not carry it.) *)

  (* ---- A CLAIM BOX HAS NO RECORD OUT (iclaim-ledger.md §5''''' step 2) --

     THE FACT [wp_ilock_sconf]'s [ClaimK] arm needs, and the reason its post
     can pin [filled = true] rather than leave it a hypothesis: while an
     [iclaim] is outstanding NOBODY holds the inum's [dinode_at].

     It is structural, not arithmetic.  A claimed column ([c <> None])
     refutes the MARKED arm outright -- [ireg_marked_ok] says [c = None] --
     so the slot must be on the IN arm or the PENDING one, and both of those
     park the record fragment [z ↪[γi] d] INSIDE the invariant; a second
     full-fraction element at the same key is invalid ([dinode_at_excl]).

     WHAT IT BUYS.  ilock has three ways to reach its continuation without
     running §16.4's box fill: the CACHED arm (the entry was loaded by an
     earlier ilock), the pool's ALLOCATED bundle, and the box itself.  The
     first two both hand the caller an [ic_loaded] / a pool bundle built
     around a [dinode_at], so this lemma kills them and the claimant's fill
     is FORCED.  That is exactly the "no free-and-reclaim since my claim"
     carrier fs-icache.md §20.7 asked for -- supplied by the c column, and
     it is what sources [create_fresh_ty]'s type equation. *)

  (* [dp->nlink++; iupdate(dp)] -- mkdir's [".."] and sys_link's
     [ip->nlink++].  It is [ireg_write_au] with the ledger moving in the
     same ghost step as the count that pays for it: (L1) grows on BOTH
     sides at once, which is what keeps the cap an inequality nobody has to
     re-argue.  The fragment travels to the [dirlink] that deposits it in
     the directory's payload.

     LANE G6 DELETED THE FLAVOUR INDEX (V1's [fl], widened by V5' to
     [option (option Z)]) with the ledger it selected: it chose which of
     [ilink]/[ilinkd]/[ilinkdp]+[iparent] the mint paid out and carried
     three type premises for the choice.  The type register's fragments are
     one shape, so the mover pays out one pile and takes none of them.

     WHAT V4'S DEAD PREMISE SAID: a PLAIN mint must show its record is
     NOT a directory, which is (T1')'s preservation -- and a walk-level
     fact at all three plain-minting sites (create's non-dir child,
     sys_link's file target).

     THE ONE UNIT OF PAYMENT IS THE SAME UNIT on all flavours -- the
     increment premise, the guard and (L4) are shared, and the sum
     [wl + wdu + wdt] rises by exactly one either way, which is what
     makes the index a flavour rather than a second currency. *)

     back what it was given, but a caller that presented the TOKEN could not
     tell the returned [⌜…⌝ ∨ ifreeze_off] apart from the pure arm and would
     have to drop it -- which is exactly the resource sys_link needs at its
     re-park.  So the arm is a parameter, and then in-and-out are the same
     proposition at the same [pin]: [true] is the token, [false] the pure

  (* ...AND ITS THREE INSTANCE WRAPPERS ARE GONE TOO (slice 6e), for
     [ireg_write_link]'s reason: [ireg_write_unlink] / [_d] / [_p] pinned
     one flavour apiece of the mover above and never had a caller.
     [ProofIupdate] applies [ireg_write_unlink_fl] directly. *)

  (* §20.8's ORPHAN COLOUR AND ITS FREE MINT ARE GONE (lane G6).
     [ireg_link_grey] minted one [IcacheRef.igrey] out of nothing, for
     create's [fail:] after a successful [dirlink(ip, "..")] and for
     sys_unlink's orphan re-park: the old ledger demanded a ticket for every
     live record and grey was the only honest colour at an orphaned [".."].
     The type register does not: an orphan's [".."] is TOKENLESS
     ([FsStateInode.ent_tokenless]), so both walks re-park with nothing owed
     and the [g] column -- with the permanent cost §20.18 ruling 2 recorded
     for it -- is deleted. *)

  (* ==================================================================== *)
  (*  §L / §LF / §LW.  THE LEND'S OPERATIONS: RETIRED                      *)
  (*      (fs-syscall-specs, THE DVIEW RETIREMENT, 2026-08-30)             *)
  (* ==================================================================== *)

  (*  These were [DirViewLend]'s column moves with an [↑iregN] open around
      them: [ireg_lcols_use] (the shared plumbing), [ireg_lcol_use] /
      [ireg_fcol_use] (the two single-column forms), and the movers
      [dv_set_rt], [fv_set_rt] and their combined wrapper [dvw_set_rt], which
      is what every byte-write re-pack called to step the two contents ghosts
      to the new record's own readings.

      ALL GONE, AND NOT ONE MOVER SITE LOST A FACT.  A re-pack's dv step was
      always SUBSUMED by the [ireg_top_retag_*] beside it: the retag moves the
      era fragment to [era_node dn' bm' data'], and the entry map and the byte
      list of that node ARE what [dv_of]/[fv_of] read off the same record and
      bytes ([FsStateEra.dir_entries_era_node], [fn_file_bytes]).  So the
      thirty-odd sites lose a line each and keep every conclusion. *)

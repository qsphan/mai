  (* ONE in-flight request's cell.  [b = true] is PENDING (the client's
     unspent obligation), [b = false] is DONE (the receipt the completion
     produced, waiting for its enqueuer).  The receipt's identity is pinned
     by the saved proposition at [γq], of which the enqueuer keeps a
     persistent copy ([perm_receipt]) -- that is what lets it recognize its
     own [Q] among everybody else's at collection time.

     THE PENDING SIDE IS THE SEQUENTIAL PERMIT (sector-atomic-disk.md §6e),
     not a single view shift: a request's data reaches the disk one 512-byte
     SECTOR at a time, so the cell holds [RiscvPtsto.sperm] at the sectors
     STILL TO LAND.  Each landing spends one branch and RE-DEPOSITS the
     residual at the same key ([perm_step]); when nothing is left the cell
     holds the leaf -- the completion's identity permit -- and [perm_consume]
     spends it for [Q].  A READ is at the leaf from the start
     ([wr_nsectors None = 0]), so the read side of the driver is unchanged. *)

     arithmetic [wp_disk_step] already hands it ([n = gen_id + 1], and the

(* WpUartgetc.v -- uartgetc(), the one xv6 UART function that has no symbol.

     static int uartgetc(struct uart *u) {
       if (ReadReg(u, LSR) & LSR_RX_READY) return ReadReg(u, RHR);
       else return -1;
     }

   It is [static] and called once, so gcc INLINES it: there is no [uartgetc]
   entry in KernelSyms.v -- there never was one -- and the coverage report,
   which is symbol-driven, cannot count it.  What exists in the image is its
   BODY, five instructions inside uartintr (+0x46 .. +0x52), with the C's
   [c != -1] test fused into the caller's loop branch: the "-1" is never
   materialized, the [beqz] on the rx-ready bit IS it.

   So this file states uartgetc the only way the compiled kernel admits: as a
   block lemma parameterized by its five instruction addresses and its two
   exits ("no input", at the branch target; "a byte", at [pcK], with the byte
   in a0).  It is the pc-parameterized-block recipe from
   claude-notes/durable-notes.md, used here not because the block occurs twice
   but because it belongs to a function that no longer has an address of its
   own.

   PORT-GENERIC (XV6_REV 163d39b).  The C takes the ELEMENT pointer now, and
   the block is stated at an abstract [i : uart_id] over the BARE
   [uart_inv i] -- [dev_inv] is the console bundle and cannot even be stated
   at the second port, while uartintr's rx drain runs at BOTH.  The two
   register bases stay parameters: gcc keeps `u->base` in a4 and `u->base + 5`
   in a3, both recomputed from the element pointer OUTSIDE this block (the
   `c.ld`/`addi` pair at +0x40/+0x42 is re-executed after every hook call and
   is therefore the caller's, not the block's -- the port-1 back edge lands at
   +0x46, INSIDE the block, so a block that began at +0x40 could not serve
   it).

   THE TRAILING [andi a0,a0,255] IS ABSORBED.  gcc emits a `zext.b` after the
   RHR read; it is the identity on the zero-extended load value
   ([ug_and255]), so the block swallows it and its exit [pcK] is the
   instruction after it, with the post still exactly "a0 holds the byte".

   Both accesses are ghost-free as far as the TRANSMITTER is concerned: no
   UART read moves the accepted trace, the transmitted prefix or DLAB
   ([DevModel.uart_read_stable]), so uartgetc needs neither the transmitter
   token nor tx_lock -- which is exactly why xv6 can run the rx drain outside
   the critical section.  The RECEIVE column is a different matter: the RHR
   read POPS, so the token rides through. *)

  (* THE SIDE CONDITION ON [rs_lsr] ARRIVES BY INSTANCE RESOLUTION.  This
     block is a multi-instruction leaf over [WpSconfUartAccess]'s converted
     UART leaves, and it applies them at two VARIABLE register indices.  For
     [rs_rhr] the disequality is already an ordinary premise below ([rs_rhr <>
     Rtp], on the raw [mword 5]) -- and [IntrDefs.srcok_solve]'s injection arm
     is exactly what turns that spelling into the class, so that premise stays
     put and nothing about it moves.  [rs_lsr] carried NO such fact: its only
     premise was the value fact [rget m rs_lsr = uart_pa i 5], which says
     nothing about tp.  Since [wp_uart_lsr_read_rx_s_sconf_at] takes [SrcOk
     rs1], an application at [rs_lsr] would have had NOTHING to resolve
     against -- and the resulting failure is the silent one, an instance
     SHELVED inside [iApply] that only surfaces at [Qed] as "Attempt to save
     an incomplete proof".  So the class is stated here too, as an implicit
     argument, which costs no positional slot: the block's call site
     (ProofUartintr.v) passes concrete registers and does not move.

     WHY IT IS TRUE AND NOT MERELY CONVENIENT: [rs_lsr] holds the UART LSR
     address, so it is a data pointer, not the thread pointer; and the value
     premise reads it as [rget m rs_lsr] at the ENTRY hart while the poll's
     load happens after a [wp_next] that may have migrated, so the leaf needs
     the read to be hart-independent for exactly the same reason [rs_rhr] does.
     The asymmetry in the ORIGINAL statement (a premise for one base, nothing
     for the other) was the gap. *)

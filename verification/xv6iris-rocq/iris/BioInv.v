(* BioInv.v -- the bio.c ownership layer over the buffer cache: the
   reference-count algebra, the per-buffer content ESCROW, the bcache lock's
   resource (with the UNCACHED POOL), and the persistent [bio_ctx] every bio
   function shares.

   Design (claude-notes/design/fs-log.md; the physical base is
   claude-notes/completed/bio.md).  The two facts that force the escrow:

   (1) A releasing holder's content must be reachable from the sleeplock side
       BY THE END of releasesleep -- a blocked waiter's acquiresleep can
       return (and its caller touch b->valid / b->data) before the releaser's
       refcnt-- runs.
   (2) bget's miss path rewrites dev/blockno/valid under ONLY bcache.lock
       (at refcnt==0), and its scan reads every buffer's dev/blockno there --
       so those cells can be fully inside neither the sleeplock chain nor
       the bcache resource.

   So the traveling content lives in a per-buffer ESCROW -- a namespace
   invariant, openable atomically at any instruction.  The layer is
   PARAMETRIC over a client view [bio_view]: the covered device+block range,
   and two opaque per-block payloads [bv_clean]/[bv_dirty] ("bs is the
   block's logical content", clean = the disk home cell agrees, dirty = the
   block is pinned by a log reference).  Bio only MOVES the payloads --
   pool -> escrow -> handle and back -- and never converts clean <-> dirty;
   holders do that with their own (log-layer) ghosts.  Three arms:

     A1 (parked):      valid cell (full, keyed by a bool v) + dev (1/2) +
                       buf_own (blockno 1/2, disk pinned 0, the 1024 data
                       bytes) + the payload [buf_pay] (v = true: the bytes
                       ARE the logical content and the disk cell is carried
                       alongside; v = false: the block's pool bundle rides
                       here so that WHOEVER wins the fill race finds it) +
                       the recycle token [bmid].
     A2 (checked out): the chain's own reference fragment with its
                       dev/blockno fraction q, the checkout token [bown k],
                       and the recycle token.
     A3 (mid-recycle): the recycler's window between the blockno store and
                       the valid store, where the blockno cell already names
                       the NEW block but the valid cell is stale: cells only,
                       decoupled from any payload, with the dev cell FULL
                       (the bcache-retained half joined in).  The recycle
                       token is OUT (in the recycler's hand): that is what
                       lets the recycler refute A1/A2 when it closes the
                       window, while every other opener refutes A3 by a dev
                       or valid cell fraction.

   The buffer's sleeplock protects EXACTLY [bown k].  A checkout
   (post-acquiresleep) refutes A2 with the bown in hand and A3 with its
   reference's dev fraction, and swaps its ref + bown in for the parked
   bundle; a park (brelse's first instruction) refutes A1 and A3 with the
   full valid cell in hand and swaps back.  The miss path (refcnt==0,
   bcache.lock held) refutes A2 with the auth (M !! k = None vs the arm's
   fragment) and A3 with the bcache-retained dev half, and mutates the
   parked cells one atomic store at a time.  The dirty payload holds a real
   [bref], so the recycler's auth ALSO refutes "dirty" at eviction: only
   clean, disk-agreeing content ever returns to the pool.

   The count algebra is FileInv's Arc algebra verbatim: auth (gmap nat
   (frac * positive)); M !! k = Some (q, n) means n outstanding references
   hold fraction q of buffer k's dev+blockno cells between them (the bundle
   holds 1/2 permanently; the bcache resource retains qr with q + qr = 1/2).
   Counts are bounded by the finite [bslot] supply (FdSlots.v's recipe): the
   caller of every increment supplies one unit, the resource stores n units
   per busy buffer, every decrement returns one -- that is what makes the
   unchecked refcnt++ provable and keeps the cell a faithful int. *)

  (* The caller-side ghost step over binit's postcondition (SpecBinit.v) plus

     park every buffer's content in a fresh escrow, and hand the caller the
     whole [bslot] supply.  Everything starts at refcnt 0 / valid 0, so the
     authority map is empty and the LRU list is binit's [blist 0 NBUF].

     range's pool bundles (its [disk_block]s paired with clean payloads --
     for the log layer, the mkfs image's content against the logged-view

(* A BIG-OP UNDER A TRANSPARENT NAME IS AN [iFrame] BOMB (optimization.md).
   This is [is_lock] plus a [big_sepL] over NBUF, and it is a conjunct of
   [FsReady.fs_ready_pre], so every frame in the FS cone unfolded it and
   tried each candidate hypothesis against all thirty elements.  Measured
   2026-08-27 by sealing it and nothing else: [ProofWritei] 84.3 s ->
   75.0 s.  ([disk_res], sealed the same way, is worth only 1.0 s there --
   size of the body is not what predicts this, being a big-op is.) *)

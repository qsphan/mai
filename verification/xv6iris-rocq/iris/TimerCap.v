(* TimerCap.v -- "S-mode on this hart may reprogram the timer", as ONE
   persistent capability.  A small definitional layer over RiscvPtsto,
   mirroring TicksInv.v one level down from the leaves that consume it
   (WpSconfTimer.v).

     sstc_enabled  -- PERSISTENT: mcounteren.TM = 1 (this hart's)
     stimecmp_free -- the [stimecmp] cell at an ARBITRARY deadline
     stimecmp_inv  -- that cell, in an invariant at [timerN]
     timer_cap     -- sstc_enabled ∗ stimecmp_inv: PERSISTENT, and all that
                      [rdtime] / [csrw stimecmp] need.  THE thing a caller
                      passes down to clockintr; nothing comes back.

   Why the pin.  Two S-mode instructions need the timer: [rdtime] (csrr
   time) and [csrw stimecmp].  The model gates BOTH on mcounteren.TM (the
   [counter_enabled 1 Supervisor] and [is_stimecmp_accessible Supervisor]
   clauses), and gates the write additionally on menvcfg.STCE -- which [sconf]
   already pins by pinning menvcfg = MENVCFG_S.  So mcounteren.TM is the only
   configuration fact a timer leaf must be handed.  xv6 sets it once, in
   timerinit (`w_mcounteren(r_mcounteren() | 2)`), and never writes mcounteren
   again; registers are per-hart ([cpu_reg_name]), so that write can be sealed
   into a PERSISTENT pin ([sstc_enabled_intro]) which every timer leaf and every
   caller then shares for free rather than threading a cell.

   [stimecmp_free] is deliberately the WEAKEST useful invariant on the deadline
   -- ownership of the cell at an arbitrary value.  Nothing in the logic tracks
   what a deadline MEANS: the tick writes mip.STIP := (stimecmp <=u mtime) and
   both mip and mtime live in the value-agnostic [clock_inv] (MinstretInv.v),
   so "when the next timer interrupt fires" is not observable here, and a
   client that must relate the deadline to something else strengthens this
   resource without changing the interface. *)

  (* ---- the deadline cell, in an INVARIANT.  Nothing in the logic depends on
     the deadline's value (see the header), so the cell has nothing to gain
     from being threaded linearly and everything to lose: every caller on the
     path down to clockintr (kerneltrap, devintr, ...) would have to carry it
     in and out.  Sealed in an invariant instead, the whole timer capability
     becomes PERSISTENT: a caller passes it and gets nothing back to track,
     and the [csrw stimecmp] leaf opens the invariant across its own single
     instruction step (timerN is disjoint from minstretN, so it is openable
     inside the step engine's callback mask).  A client that later DOES need
     to know the deadline holds the cell directly instead -- [stimecmp_free]
     is still the raw form, and this invariant is one ghost step away. *)

(* SpecSysMkdir.v -- the public interface of sys_mkdir(), stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     uint64 sys_mkdir(void) {
       char path[MAXPATH];
       struct inode *ip;

       begin_op();
       if (argstr(0, path, MAXPATH) < 0 || (ip = create(path, T_DIR, 0, 0)) == 0) {
         end_op();
         return -1;
       }
       iunlockput(ip);
       end_op();
       return 0;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.sys_mkdir, 72 bytes / 26 instructions (CodeSysMkdir.v).
   An EIGHTEEN-slot frame: ra@136 (slot 1), s0@128 (slot 2, the frame
   pointer) and the low SIXTEEN slots -- slot 18 down to slot 3 -- being the
   [char path[128]] local.  [addi aN,s0,-144] is that buffer's address, and
   it is also the pushed sp.  **No callee-saved register beyond ra/s0 is
   touched at all**: [ip] never leaves a0 (create returns it there and
   iunlockput's argument is already in place), so there is no [s1] to save,
   and the epilogue is three instructions.

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT =====================================

   sys_mkdir is the FIRST of the two syscall-level consumers of the sealed
   [SpecCreate.wp_create_sconf] (sys_mknod is the other, and is this file's
   twin).  It contributes nothing of its own: it opens a log transaction,
   fetches one string, hands it to create with [ty := T_DIR] and
   [major = minor = 0], and drops the LOCKED inode create hands back.  So
   the whole contract is create's own, with the process block and the two
   ledgers threaded around it and everything inode-shaped consumed inside.

   THE C SHORT-CIRCUIT COMPILES TO ONE SHARED FAILURE ARM.  Both
   disjuncts -- the [bltz] at +0x1a on argstr's return and the [c.beqz] at
   +0x2c on create's -- branch to the SAME block at +0x40 (end_op, [a0 =
   -1], jump to the epilogue), with no intermediate rejoin and no register
   to restore.  There are therefore exactly TWO arms, not the four
   sys_chdir has.

   ==== THE LOG LEDGER, AND THE FLOOR IT RESTS ON =======================

   begin_op mints [LogInv.log_op g MAXOPBLOCKS] = ten units, create takes
   the whole reservation in SET form ([LogInv.log_opS], because its own
   distinct-block set is at most six against a counted sum far past ten --
   SpecCreate.v's header), and end_op retires whatever is left.  So nothing
   log-shaped crosses this interface.

   What does NOT close on its own is the [iunlockput(ip)] at +0x2e, which
   runs BEFORE end_op and wants [SpecIput.iput_units] = three in hand.
   Nothing between create's return and that call mints a unit, so the call
   is payable only out of create's own residue -- and create's post offers
   a CEILING ([u' <= u]) that says nothing about it.  The clause that makes
   this function provable is the [ok = true] floor
   [(iput_units <= u')%nat], added to [SpecCreate]'s post for exactly these
   two callers.  It is guarded on [ok] and the guard is forced (create's
   [fail:] tail cannot pay it -- see SpecCreate.v's header); [ok = true] is
   precisely when this function runs its [iunlockput], so the guard costs
   nothing here.  On the mkdir arm the floor is ATTAINED, with zero slack
   ([CreateBudget.cr_budget_mkdir]'s [u6 = 3]).

   ==== THE REFERENCE LEDGER ============================================

   create is entered with [iref_slots ns] for [create_slots <= ns] and, on
   success, keeps exactly ONE out -- the reference to the inode it returns
   -- which its post now states as the equation [S ns' = ns].
   [iunlockput(ip)] spends that reference and hands the slot back, so the
   success arm ends at [ns' + 1 = ns]; the failure arms never made a
   reference and create's post gives [ns' = ns] outright; and the argstr
   arm never reached create.  All three therefore end at [ns], which is
   what this contract says.

   IT USED TO SAY THE INTERVAL [ns - create_slots <= ns2 <= ns], on the
   grounds that create's own figure was an interval and this was the
   tightest thing statable.  That was true of the STATEMENT and not of the
   function: all nine of create's continuation sites already computed the
   exact figure and then weakened it.  Saying it outright is what lets a
   caller re-establish [create_slots <= ns] and go round again, and what
   lets [SpecSyscall]'s dispatch hand [iref_slots IREFSPARE] back
   unchanged -- which it must, because [UsertrapRes.ut_own] carries the
   allowance at that literal.

   NO COLOUR-LEDGER RESOURCE APPEARS HERE (design/fs-icache.md 20.18
   ruling 1).  Every directory record this syscall writes is written
   INSIDE create, whose contract owns that accounting.

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   Strictly more than sys_chdir's, and all of it is create's rather than
   this function's: the printk credential pair ([printk_env] and the pure
   superblock cells rather than two ([sb_ninodes] and [sb_size] beside
   [sb_inodestart] and [sb_bmapstart]), and mkfs's inode geometry
   ([1 < ninodes <= 16 * nib < 2^31] plus the [ushort] tie
   [16 * nib <= 2^16] create's [lw a2,4(s3)] consumes).

   [eb = true] is create's premise, inherited verbatim.  The
   [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded anyway,
   uniformly with begin_op / iunlockput / end_op, and is [emp] there --
   create itself does not take the pair, so the walk drops it and re-mints
   per callee (ProofNamex's device).

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function sleeps in all four of
   its callees, so it may return on a hart other than the one it was called
   on.

   DETERMINISM: none is claimed, and none is available.  Which of the two
   arms runs is a function of the FILE SYSTEM and of the user string, and
   no caller of this contract knows either.  The postcondition is therefore
   the honest disjunction on the returned a0. *)

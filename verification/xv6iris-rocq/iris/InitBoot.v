(*  InitBoot.v -- THE FIRST PROCESS'S EXEC BUNDLE.

    THE KERNEL NEVER MINTS A USER-EXECUTION SLOT.  Every slot in the tree
    is either a verified program's own constructor or the generic
    inhabitant a supply pays for, and the kernel is not the party that
    holds either: the one thing it needs about the first process's user
    execution is what forkret's boot arm spends on [kexec("/init")], and
    that is an exec bundle like any other caller's -- a walk cursor, an
    observation receipt, and a SLOT PIECE that answers with the slot at
    the key kexec builds.

    So the boot bundle is what the whole-system theorem asks its
    application for ([SystemAdequacy.xv6_power_adequacy_gen]'s
    [Hinit_boot]), and the kernel merely carries it: main hands it to
    userinit, userinit's park captures it, forkret's boot arm takes it out
    of the park package and hands it to kexec, and the receipt kexec
    returns IS the first process's slot.  The generic theorem discharges
    it from the trivial mint ([init_boot_bundle_triv]); a constraining
    application discharges it from its own pinned bundle at "/init".

    THE PATH IS NAMED ONCE.  [init_boot_bytes] is the six bytes of
    "/init" as the naming function [KexecDefs] indexes by, and
    [init_boot_path] is the same string as the walk's [pl].  forkret's
    boot arm calls kexec at exactly these ([ProofForkretParts]'s layout
    facts are stated at them). *)

  (* NO [`{CID : CpuId}] AND NO [`{XI : CurCtx}], deliberately: nothing in
     the bundle reads the hart or its context ([SysOpenDefs]'s note on
     [aopen_commit_at] is the reason -- a context-indexed exec piece makes
     two proofs at two contexts hold slots that print identically and do
     not match), and the park package that carries this row is built at
     the PARKER's context and spent at the RESUMER's. *)
  Context `{GEN : GenId}.
  (* NO [ctokG] BINDER OF ITS OWN: [Xv6G.xv6_ctok] is in scope, and a second
     [Context `{!ctokG Σ}] beside it would win instance resolution here while
     every file that has only [xv6G] resolves to the field -- two instances
     that print alike and do not match ([UexecSG]'s note).  The class index
     is met by the field; the SG binder is NON-generalizing (braces) so that
     it resolves rather than abstracting a fresh one. *)
  Context {SG : uexecSG Σ}.

  (* WHAT THE APPLICATION OWES THE KERNEL ABOUT USER EXECUTION, and it is
     the only thing it owes: kexec's caller-side bundle at "/init", at the
     first process's working directory [cw] and descriptor view [sts],
     with the SLOT PIECE at [UexecRet.uslot].  The cursor, the miss
     family, the observation pair and the refund are the bundle's own
     choice -- the kernel reads none of them, it only spends the bundle --
     so they are existential here and pinned by whoever builds one.

     LINEAR.  Its pieces are one-shot ([PieceFam]'s pairs), so the bundle
     travels the route [FdSlots.fd_frags] travels: userinit hands it to
     [ParkCap.park_token_park], which puts it in the park package, and
     forkret's boot arm takes it out and spends it.

     [na = 1] and the single argument being the path again is forkret's
     call verbatim: [kexec("/init", (char *[]){"/init", 0})]. *)
  (* AT THE TRIVIAL PAYLOAD.  <init> has no parent, so its exit owes
     nobody anything: userinit's own choice ([SpecUserinit] states it), and
     the payload the slot wands hand the exec'd image is therefore
     [fun _ => True] -- which is exactly what a generic family can pay
     exit with ([UexecRet.uexec_pay_dep_triv]). *)
  (* ...AND IT TAKES THE CONSOLE'S READER TOKEN AS AN INPUT (app-echo.md,
     "SH-LINE RULING", R3).  The token is born with the ring at boot
     ([ConsoleInv.cons_ghosts_boot]) and is THE KERNEL'S TO HAND, not the
     application's to mint: [SystemAdequacy]'s [Hinit_boot] asks the
     application for the bundle out of [app_inv] alone, and its statement
     does not move.  So the token is a PREMISE OF THE BUNDLE, threaded
     main -> userinit -> the park package's boot mode -> forkret's boot
     arm, which applies it here before spending the bundle on
     kexec("/init").  A constraining application builds the bundle HOLDING
     the token and can therefore put it in the slot wand's conclusion --
     [PinnedExec.pinned_exec_bundle]'s linear [Pay] is that slot, and it
     is why no arity of [SpecKexec.exec_slot_pre] changes.  The generic
     instance drops it ([init_boot_bundle_triv]). *)
  (* AT EVERY CHILDREN SET AND PID (lane EXEC-SEAM).  [SpecKexec.
     exec_slot_pre] now names the caller's two identity readings, and the
     boot arm names the first process's when it spends the bundle
     ([ProofForkret.fkr_boot]); the application's constructor reads
     neither, so the bundle is owed at all of them and the arity of this
     predicate -- which [App.Hinit_boot] names -- does not move. *)
  (* ...AND IT CARRIES THE FIRST PROCESS'S ALL-PARKED ROW (lane
     OFF-HAND-2).  The one kexec <init> ever gets is spent by
     [ProofForkret.fkr_boot], which holds neither the descriptor bundle nor
     the block's array and so cannot READ the fact; the bundle's producers
     can -- every one of them states it at [FdSlots.fdt0]
     ([FdSlots.fdv_all_parked_fdt0]), because that is the table userinit
     built.  It is spent by the BUNDLE'S OWN PRODUCERS (lane OFF-HAND-5,
     D1): the kexec contract stopped carrying a row, so what the fact pays
     for is the taint arm of whichever builder inhabits this bundle --
     [SpecKexec.exec_au_pre_triv_at] for the generic application,
     [PinnedExec.pinned_exec_bundle_boot] for a constraining one. *)

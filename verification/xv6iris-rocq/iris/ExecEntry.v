     carried a row saying the key's table had no descriptor with its offset
     half outside the kernel, on the theory that a generic family could
     never be handed such a descriptor.  Fact 4 makes the theory false and
     the row pointless in one step -- THE HALF IS IN THE DESCRIPTOR BUNDLE
     ([FdSlots.foff_row] at [OffHeld]), so the kernel holds it at every
     fire and a generic image's deposits owe nothing about offsets at any
     mode.  A held row therefore crosses an exec on BOTH arms, which is

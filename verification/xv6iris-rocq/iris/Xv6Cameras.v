(*  Xv6Cameras.v -- THE CAMERAS THE KERNEL'S GHOST STATE IS BUILT FROM.

    Every class in this file is an [inG]/[ghost_varG]/[ghost_mapG] bundle --
    a claim about what cameras live in [Σ], and nothing else.  None of them
    carries a [gname].  That is the membership test [Xv6G.v] states, and
    this file is where the members are DEFINED.

    ---- WHY THEY LIVE HERE AND NOT IN THEIR SUBSYSTEM'S FILE ------------

    [Xv6G.xv6G] unions twelve subsystems, so it can only sit above all of
    them -- and with the classes spread across [SmodeCore] (the M-mode
    execution engine), [IcacheRef], [InodeRegion], [WpUart] and the rest,
    "above all of them" meant a cone of eighty-two files.  Every one of the
    767 files that binds the bundle therefore waited on the inode region,
    the pipe layer and the UART driver whether or not it named them, and an
    edit to any single subsystem's algebra rebuilt all 767.

    Nothing in the union justified that.  A camera is a TYPE-LEVEL claim:
    the vocabulary below is pure iris/stdpp algebra over a handful of plain
    records ([vslot], [virtio_cfg], [disk_wr], [dinode], [dclaim],
    [lock_state], [ic_dep]).  Nothing here mentions [iProp], a weakest
    precondition, an invariant, or the machine model.  So the whole file
    sits on three shallow imports and the bundle's cone becomes eleven
    files, every one of them base layer.

    ---- WHAT MOVED, AND WHAT DID NOT -----------------------------------

    THE RULE: this file holds the camera TYPES; each subsystem's own file
    keeps the constructors, projections and lemmas stated over them --
    [IcacheRef]'s [lelem*]/[lreg*]/boot maps and their validity proofs,
    [PipeInvDefs]'s [pn_end]/[pn_mark], [WpLock]'s whole lock theory.  Each
    of those files [Require Export]s this one, so every name they used to
    define is still in scope for their importers, and no downstream
    signature changes.

    NOT HERE, and each for a reason that is not about depth:

    - [icfg], [fscfg], [riscvGS]'s [riscv_eraGS], and the name records
      ([bio_names], [disk_names], [fs_names], [uart_names], [pipe_names],
      ...).  Records of NAMES and configuration, not capacity; they are
      minted per boot or per power-on and belong where they are.

    - [fileG].  It carries [icfg] beside its camera, so it fails the
      membership test as it stands; folding its [inG Σ fileUR] half in
      means retiring the class in favour of [icfg] at its 432 binder
      sites, which is its own increment.

    - [diskImgG].  Pure, but [RiscvPtsto.riscvFixedGS] CARRIES it
      ([riscvF_diskGS]), so a second path from [xv6G] would be a live
      duplicate-class trap in every scope that holds both.

    - [mono_natG].  Same reason, one level up: [riscvFixedGS] owns the
      generation counter ([riscvF_genGS]), and [LogInv]'s epoch and
      [DiskPtsto]'s counter both read it off there rather than minting a
      second instance.

    - [fdslotG], [irefslotG], [pavG].  Each is a pure [pre] class PLUS one
      [gname], minted by [BootShared.v]; the full classes do not exist
      until boot has run.

    ADDING A MEMBER TAKES THREE THINGS: the field here, a row in
    [Xv6G.xv6GΣ], and a [subG] instance for the member itself -- [solve_inG]
    has to be able to CONSTRUCT it, so a class with no [subG] breaks
    [subG_xv6GΣ] with "Cannot infer this placeholder".  *)

(*  5.  THE DISK DRIVER'S GHOSTS  (theory: DiskPtsto.v, DiskInv.v)        *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* THE CLAIM VALUE.  What a publish records about a request, fixed for the
   request's whole life: the [HActive] receipt carries it (that is what a
   sleeping [virtio_disk_rw] re-finds its request through), and [dn_claim]
   maps the position to it -- authority in the vdisk_lock's resource,
   fragment in the receipt -- which is how the interrupt handler, holding
   the lock, knows the SAME claim at each of its openings of the device
   invariant.  Four fields, one per downstream obligation:

     dc_buf   the [struct buf]: which cache entry the payoff belongs to;
     dc_slot  the published slot: fixes [vs_data] (a write's payload) and
              which block, i.e. the postcondition's [disk_block ...];
     dc_pin   the pinned bytes: naming the map is what lets the publisher
              split the reclaim payoff back into the windows it wrote.

   The long form is in DiskPtsto.v, above [Record disk_names]. *)
Record dclaim := DClaim {
  dc_buf  : Arch.pa;
  dc_slot : vslot;
  dc_pin  : gmap Arch.pa (bv 8);
  (* THE POSITION this chain was published at.  The receipt below carries the
     [dn_slot] fragment for it while the request is live, and the interrupt
     handler retires the slot with that fragment -- so the position has to be
     pinned in the claim rather than existentially quantified. *)
  dc_pos  : nat;
}.

(* THE PER-DESCRIPTOR RECEIPT (tools/vtest/README.md finding 5).

   xv6 indexes [disk.info[]] by the HEAD descriptor of a chain, and the
   interrupt handler learns a head -- [disk.used->ring[i].id] -- not a
   position in the available ring.  Since the device may complete out of
   turn those are different numbers, so the driver's per-request state is
   keyed by head, over the fixed eight descriptors, exactly like
   [disk.free[NUM]] and [disk.info[NUM]] in the C.

   [HInactive] is a descriptor nobody has submitted: free (its bytes are in
   the pool) or allocated and still being filled in.  It says NOTHING about
   [disk.info[i].b] -- unlike [info[i].status], which [desc[t]] points at and
   the device writes, [info[i].b] is named by no descriptor and the device
   never sees it, so while the slot is idle that cell is plain driver state
   and rides in the lock resource with the rest of the free slot.  It
   transfers into the receipt only for the in-flight window, because that is
   the one stretch where its owner (the interrupt handler, which learns the
   head from the used ring) is not the thread that allocated it.  [HActive v] is one
   whose chain is live, and the claim [v] records what was published --
   which buffer, which slot, which pinned bytes, which position.
   The FRAGMENT is what [virtio_disk_rw] carries across [sleep()]'s release
   of [vdisk_lock]: holding it is what re-authorises the poll of [b->disk]
   on every re-acquire. *)
Inductive hstate :=
  | HInactive
  (* published: the device has the chain, or it has come back *)
  | HActive (v : dclaim).

(* NB: the disk IMAGE map is deliberately NOT here -- it is
   [DiskImg.diskImgG], which [RiscvPtsto.riscvFixedGS] carries
   ([riscvF_diskGS]), because the era auth rides in [state_interp] while
   the fragments are elements of the same map.  A second path from [xv6G]
   would be exactly the duplicate-class trap this file exists to avoid.

   [mono_natG] IS NOT A FIELD HERE either.  It was, and [riscvFixedGS] owns
   one too ([riscvF_genGS], the generation counter) -- so any scope holding
   [riscvGS] and this class had TWO paths to one [inG], and
   [mono_nat_auth_own_frac γ] built at one would not frame against the other
   while printing identically.  That is what made [RiscvAdequacy]'s

   [FsState.top_frag]), so the class reaches [ProcInv.proc_priv] through
   [FirstTok.first_boot_persist] and from there essentially every proof
   file in the tree; the alternative to membership is an explicit binder in
   ~400 of them.  The one thing that had to move for it is the record
   [fs_node] itself ([FsNode.v]); the whole [FsState*] theory stays where
   it is, and this file's cone grows by one leaf over [DinodeEnc], which it
   already requires.

(* ---- the LINK-COUNTING FAMILY (theory: FsStateLink.v) ---------------- *)

(* [fs_state.md] section 2's counting RA: ONE auth-of-nat per inum, all
   inums in a single element at [γlink].  [natUR]'s [op] is [+] and its
   [≼] is [≤], so the law "#tokens ≤ nlink" IS [auth_both_valid_discrete]
   plus [nat_included]; [k] separate tokens compose because
   [◯ 1 ⋅ ◯ 1 = ◯ 2].  One camera keyed by inum (rather than one gname per
   inum) is what lets a whole instance be allocated by a single
   [own_alloc].

   IT IS A MEMBER for [fsTopG]'s reason, one step further on: since
   durable-disk 2b-inode-4 a checked-out payload carries its directory's
   link TOKENS ([IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] holds [FsStateInode.ent_toks])
   and the inode REGION parks the per-inum authority
   ([InodeRegion.ireg_slot]), so the class would otherwise be an explicit
   binder on [ireg_inv] -- hence on the thirty-odd fs contracts that thread
   it -- and on every payload site.  Nothing had to move for it: the
   camera is plain iris algebra.

   THE STANDING RULE APPLIES: a file at or above [Xv6G.v] binds [xv6G] and
   NOT this class.  The [FsState*] stack, which sits below the bundle,
   binds it alone.

   NAMED [fsLinkUR], not [linkUR]: the inode cache's own ledger camera
   (section 11 below) already owns that name in this file.

   THE COUNT AND THE TYPE ARE ONE RA -- THE TYPE REGISTER (fs-state.md
   section 6.5, lane G5).  Per inum: [authUR (gmultisetUR ity)] with
   [ity := TFile | TDir p].  The AUTHORITY is a UNIFORM multiset
   [(nlink + [type = DIR and live]) copies of ty] parked in the inode
   region beside the record and tied to it; the FRAGMENTS are singletons
   [{[ty]}], one per counted dirent, and they ride in the naming
   directory's checked-out payload ([FsStateInode.ent_toks]).

   Validity gives the two readings at once: a fragment's element IS the
   authority's [ty] (AGREEMENT -- a uniform multiset has one element), and
   #fragments <= multiplicity (the COUNT law, which is what the free path
   reads).  Retyping is legal exactly at multiplicity zero, where the
   authority is [auth-empty] and the type is not mentioned at all.

   This replaces the [prodUR (authUR natUR) fsParUR] of lanes G2/G3: there
   is no separate count column any more (the link count IS the fragment
   count) and no separate parent register (a directory's [ty] carries its
   parent, and its ["."] fragment ties that to its [".."] entry). *)

   what lets a walk arm from a RESIDUE after an [ilock] has parked a share

   name for every process it hands out and freeproc drops it, so the name
   identifies THIS incarnation -- which is what a wait()-side resource
   transfer is indexed by, a pid being reused and a generation not
   ([UexecSlot.uvis_gen] is the key's reading of it).

   The name is a SAVED ELEMENT and not a plain camera, because what it
   carries is a PREDICATE: the slot address, the pid, and the process's
   exit PAYLOAD [Q : Z -> iProp].  [ChildTok.genF] is that element's
   functor and [ChildTok.v] is the whole theory -- the parent's quarter
   ([child_tok]), the kernel's ([gen_kq]), the discarded half the child's
   [my_pay] and the two persistent readings come off, and the payment rule
   the escrow is redeemed by. *)
(* THE CLASS ITSELF IS [ChildTok.ctokG], one file below, and that is the one

   generation's pieces bind no bundle and would otherwise have to import
   [saved_prop] to spell the raw class -- whose re-exports re-shadow
   [Forall_forall] and the numeral scopes wherever the [Require] lands.  The

(*  14d. THE WAIT LOCK'S CHILDREN CELLS  (theory: WaitInv.v)             *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* The [wait_lock] sibling of the parent cells: one [gset gname] per slot,
   the generations of that slot's live children.  A ghost list and not
   memory, because [struct proc] has no such field -- the C code reads the
   same information by scanning [p->parent], and the ghost is the scan's
   contents-out form ([WaitInv.children_own_at]).

   A GHOST MAP AND NOT A LIST OF VARIABLES, keyed by the process's own
   children-ghost name ([ProcDefs.pv_chg]): the AUTHORITY is the lock's
   payload and the ROW is the process's -- it rides the trap residue beside
   [FdSlots.fd_frags] ([WaitInv.ch_frag]).  That is what makes the two
   halves findable: a lock holder that also holds a row learns the map's
   entry by [ghost_map_lookup], where two halves of a per-process
   [ghost_var_frac] would leave it unable to say WHICH entry of the payload is
   its own.  A row is installed under the lock ([ghost_map_insert] at a
   name allocated cofinitely against the domain) and deleted there when the
   incarnation is reaped.

   THE VALUE CARRIES THE OWNER'S SLOT ADDRESS beside its set.  A row's key
   is a ghost name, and nothing in the lock's payload can say which slot
   that name belongs to -- [ProcDefs.pv_chg] lives under p->lock and
   [ChildTok.gen_slot] reads a GENERATION to a slot, not a row name.  The
   address is therefore fixed inside the AUTHORITY, where no row holder
   can move it, and the trap residue pins it to the running process's own
   slot ([UsertrapRes.ut_own] carries the row at [un_pj N]).  That is what
   makes [WaitInv.children_inv] statable. *)
(* THE NAME IS CANONICAL, and that is what makes the row spellable where
   it has to live.  A row rides the DORMANT BLOCK of the slot it belongs to
   ([ProcDefs.proc_dormant]) -- born once at boot, handed out by allocproc,
   returned by freeproc -- and [ProcDefs] sits below every party that
   threads a lock's gname, so a per-boot [γc] parameter would have to reach
   [SchedCtx.procs_inv] and its 389 spellings.  It is carried by the class
   instead, on [FdSlots.fdslot_name] / [ProcAvail.pav_name] /
   [bioslot_name]'s precedent: the capacity below may be assumed by
   adequacy, the NAME may not, so it is minted inside the boot fupd
   ([WaitInv.children_res_alloc], called from [BootShared]) and the
   instance handed out existentially. *)
(* ...AND THE ORPHANS, ON THE SAME CLASS AND FOR THE SAME REASON.  A
   process's children do not die with it: kexit hands them to <init>
   (kernel/proc.c's [reparent]), and the generations that were handed over
   that way are the second thing <wait_lock> owns ([WaitInv.orphans_own]).
   It is a plain [ghost_var_frac] at a MAP FROM THE NEW PARENT'S ADDRESS to the
   generations reparented to it -- a second children table, keyed the way
   the row values are, and the column a lock holder may move without
   holding anybody's row.  Its name is carried here beside the map's,
   minted in the same boot fupd ([WaitInv.children_res_alloc]), so that no
   gname threads through the tree. *)
(* ...AND THE TWO GHOSTS THAT SAY WHICH INCARNATION IS THE CURRENT ONE
   ([SlotGen.v] is the theory).  They ride this class for the reason the map
   and the orphans do -- a canonical name, minted in the same boot fupd
   ([WaitInv.children_res_alloc]) -- and because the parties that hold their
   halves are the same three: the process's private block, the slot's
   dormant block, and <wait_lock>'s payload.

   [sgenUR] -- THE SLOT'S CURRENT GENERATION, keyed by the slot's ADDRESS
   ([ProcGeom.proc_addr], which is what [ProcDefs.proc_dormant] and
   [ProcInv.proc_priv] are stated at).  Fractional agreement and NO
   authority: the whole updates on its own (allocproc, at the mint), two
   halves agree, and the whole excludes any other fraction -- which is what
   makes -- this ZOMBIE block is entry k of the wait-lock invariant -- a
   resource fact rather than a pure one.

   [ghost_mapG Σ Z gname] -- THE PID REGISTER, keyed by the pid's VALUE.
   Here the AUTHORITY is real and it lives in <pid_lock>'s payload
   ([PidLock.nextpid_res_at]), because a pid is CHOSEN -- allocproc's scan
   is what proves the key fresh, and that scan runs under that lock and no
   other.  Two halves at one key agree on the generation, which is the pid
   uniqueness PidLock's header used to record as a further step.
     AT [Z] AND NOT AT [mword 32]: a ghost map's class carries its key's
   [Countable], so a client that spells the key type re-resolves that
   instance -- and an [mword] has two in this tree (stdpp's [bv_countable]
   and [SailStdpp.Instances.Countable_mword], the leak durable-notes
   records), so the class a client builds need not be the one this field
   has.  [Z] has exactly one.  Nothing is lost: two pids with one value
   ARE one pid ([bv_eq]). *)
(* THE MAP TYPE IS NAMED TOO, and it is what [SlotGen] states its own
   definitions at.  A ucmra's CARRIER is not a map type as far as
   unification is concerned (it cannot ensure that [ucmra -> Type] is a
   subtype of [Type -> Type]), so the map lemmas cannot see through
   [sgenUR]; and spelling [gmap (mword 64) _] again in another file
   resolves [Countable (mword 64)] against whatever instances THAT file
   happens to import (stdpp's [bv_countable] vs [SailStdpp.Instances.

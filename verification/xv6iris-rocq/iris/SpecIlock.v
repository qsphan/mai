   174 bytes, 61 instructions.  iupdate is the FLUSH; this is the LOAD --
   same IBLOCK arithmetic, same [DinodeEnc] slot, [memmove] running the
   other way -- with a lock acquisition and a cached/uncached split on top.

   ---- THE ENTRY IS A SLOT, NOT A POINTER ------------------------------

   [ip] is [IcacheRefDefs.ientry k] for a slot [k < NINODE], not a free pointer:
   the whole icache is indexed by slot ([ientry_inj] makes the two views
   interchangeable) and the escrow, the reference algebra and the [ref]-word
   invariant are all keyed that way.  It is also what kills the first
   panic's null test with no premise at all -- [ientry_unsigned] says the
   address is [itable + 24 + 136k], which is never zero.

   ---- WHAT IT CONSUMES, AND WHAT IT PRODUCES --------------------------

   IN: ONE SHARE, [IcacheRef.inode_shr k s dev inum] -- and it is consumed
   (v3, design §14.6/§14.8).  v2 took a whole REFERENCE; the caller that
   actually exists is fileread, whose inode reference is parked in the file
   payload for the duration of the call and can only LEND, so what crosses
   ilock's boundary is a slice of the identity cells plus the matching slice
   of the slot's liveness unit ([IcacheRef.inode_ref_carve], a pure resource
   split -- no fupd, no invariant, §14.7(2)).  A share carries NO count
   fragment ([positiveR] has no zero, §14.5), which is why the [ref < 1]
   guard below reads through the liveness pool instead.  ilock has exactly
   one caller in the tree, so there is no reference-shaped variant of this
   contract.

   The share is DEPOSITED, exactly as v2's reference was: §13.1d, a checkout
   hands its credential to the escrow's checked-out arm, where it waits for
   iunlock.  That is why this contract hands nothing back that could be
   spent, and why SpecIunlock v3 is the only way to recover the share.  What
   it DOES hand back is the other half of the entry sleeplock's descriptor
   variable ([IcacheEscrow.ic_deposit] at the checkout descriptor) -- §14.8's
   repair: with the OUT arm able to hold either a share or a reference, that
   half is what lets the parker find its own arm again, and it pins the
   fraction and the identity so that iunlock's postcondition needs no
   existential.  Both identity CELLS come out at the escrow's permanent half
   (§13.1e) -- which is what lets ilock read [ip->dev] for its own bread
   after the deposit, and what lets iunlock return the share AT THIS
   DEVICE.

   The three persistent invariants replace what v1 asked a caller to own
   outright: [itable_inv] (the [ref] words -- v1's [i_ref ip ↦₄{dqr} refv]
   premise was UNSATISFIABLE, design §4), [ic_escrow] (the entry's content),
   [ireg_inv] (the inode region -- v1's [fs_chalf] of the whole inode block,
   plus its [diblk_wf] and its conditional-slot premise, all three of which
   §11.3 retires).  The sleeplock protects only [ic_tok fsc_ic k], the checkout
   token; the CONTENT travels through the escrow, because iget rewrites a
   recycled entry's cells holding [itable.lock] and no sleeplock at all.

   OUT: the checked-out bundle at an EXISTENTIAL [(dn, bm)] -- literally
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] plus the two identity halves and the valid cell,
   i.e. literally SpecIunlock v2's precondition and literally what
   [ic_swap_park] consumes.  The record is ∃-bound because nothing outside
   ilock knows it: v1's caller named it through the [inode_key] shadow, and
   §13.1 retires the shadow (with N reference holders only two ghost_var_frac
   halves exist, so "the caller supplies one" is unsatisfiable for the
   second holder -- the same multi-holder trap as v1's [i_ref] premise).
   readi/writei instantiate from the existential exactly as they already do
   from [inode_locked]'s existential [data].

   PARKED-MEANS-FLUSHED (§13.1d/§13.6): the bundle's [dinode_at] is at the
   SAME [dn] as the metadata cells, not at a separate stale record.  It is
   provable on both arms -- the cached arm inherits it from the parked arm,
   the uncached arm reads the record OFF the region and so reconstructs
   exactly it -- and it is REQUIRED, because a caller that does not iupdate
   (fileread, whose middle callee is readi) could otherwise never discharge
   iunlock's flushed-record obligation.  Stale in-memory records exist only
   INSIDE a critical section, between a writei and its iupdate.

   ---- ONE PANIC IS DEAD, ONE IS LIVE ----------------------------------

   [ip == 0 || ip->ref < 1] is REFUTED: the null half by [ientry_unsigned]
   as above, the count half by [IcacheInv.iref_live_load_au] against
   [itable_inv], whose delivered [0 < v < 2^31] is exactly what
   [InodeLock.inode_ref_spos] turns into "[bge x0,a5] falls through" (v1
   took those bounds as a premise about a caller-owned cell).  v2 read
   through the reference's COUNT fragment ([iref_load_au]); a share has
   none, and reads through its LIVENESS slice instead -- a free slot's whole
   unit sits inside [IcacheInv.itable_body], so owning any slice at all
   proves the slot is live.  That lemma takes [k < NINODE] as a premise
   where its count-side twin derived it from [icM_wf]; this contract has it
   already.

   [ip->type == 0] IS LIVE -- A FIRST FOR THIS TREE.  §13.1: the shadow that
   used to carry v1's conditional agreement premise is gone, a caller
   premise "this inum is allocated" would be undischargeable today
   (allocatedness is directory-structure knowledge -- namei/ialloc, future
   work), and the pool legitimately holds free inodes (the pool row's
   type-0 shape, §13.3).  So on the free-inode arm ilock DIVERGES through
   [SpecPanic]'s own contract and this postcondition speaks only for
   successful loads.  That is sound in a partial-correctness WP and it is
   the honest statement; every other panic in this tree is refuted, and the
   proof file says at which instruction this one is taken.

   ---- THE CLAIM-BOX INDICATOR (fs-sysfile D₀, increment 1) -------------

   The postcondition carries one more output, [filled : bool], and the
   conditional fact [filled = true -> InodeRegion.fresh_shape dn].  This is
   NOT new content: [InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw] already PROVES
   [fresh_shape] and hands it to [ProofIlock]'s third fill sub-arm --
   §16.4's CLAIM BOX, the first fill of an entry [ialloc] has just claimed
   -- and that arm then spends it building [inode_ok] / [dir_ok] and drops
   it.  The contract simply failed to expose proven content, and exposing
   it is the point of the exercise.

   IT HAS TO BE CONDITIONAL, and the boolean is the condition rather than a
   premise, because [fresh_shape dn] is FALSE on the other two arms: a
   cached entry and an ordinary fill both return a record with real size
   and real blocks.  So [filled] means EXACTLY "this call took §16.4's
   claim-box arm", the cached arm and the ordinary fill both report
   [false], and a caller that cannot show [filled = true] is exactly where
   it was before.

   WHO WANTS IT: create's [ilock(ip)] at +0x98, on the inode [ialloc] just
   claimed.  [SpecCreate]'s [made] arm needs [di_size dn = 0] and
   [di_addrs dn = replicate 13 (bv_0 32)] -- for [ProofCreateParts.
   cr_made_setf]'s [create_made] identity and for [dirlink(ip,".")]'s
   "the append fits" premise, neither of which [InodeLock.inode_ok]'s
   loose size cap can give -- and [fresh_shape] is exactly those two facts.
   That leaves [di_type dn = ty] as the half of create's fresh-record
   obligation that [ProofCreateFreshTy.v] proves off the [ClaimK] index
   below and nothing more.
   Every other caller ignores the pair.

   ilock SLEEPS (acquiresleep, and bread inside the uncached arm), so it
   threads the full running-process bundle.  It enters and returns at
   noff 0.  ONE [bslot]: bread's reference, which brelse gives back. *)

     §16.4's fill has a sub-arm -- the CLAIM BOX -- that no caller can be
     left stuck on, and [InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw] is the only thing that
     can discharge it.  The index says which of the three currencies this
     caller brought and therefore which discharge runs; see
     [InodeRegion.ilkc].  In one line each:

       [ClaimK ty]  create's child fill, and the only site that can present
                    ialloc's typed [iclaim].  It brings the claim TOGETHER
                    with the claim-flavoured provenance unit its own
                    reference carries, the withdraw CONVERTS the pair into
                    the plain unit, and the post below pins BOTH
                    [filled = true] and [di_type dn = ty] -- which is
                    exactly [ProofCreateFreshTy]'s span conjunct.  The
                    other two shapes the entry could be in
                    (cached, or a pool bundle) are refuted by
                    [InodeRegion.ireg_claim_no_out]: a claimed inum's record
                    is INSIDE the region, so nobody holds its [dinode_at].
       [PlainK]     the twelve in-file-unit sites.  The unit their own
                    reference carries collides with the claim pin's (R3),
                    which DERIVES [c = None] -- the box arm is refuted and
                    the unit comes straight back out.
       [ShotK ty]   the three fd sites, which can hold no whole unit across
                    this call (their inode payload is behind a cancellable
                    invariant no syscall may keep open here).  What they DO
                    hold, free and persistent, is this generation's own
                    one-shot -- and a one-shot in hand means the generation

  (* ---- THE TRANSACTION'S TOKEN, HANDED IN AT THE LOCK ---------------
     (durable-fs-plan.md section 3, [ilock]; durable-disk B''-tx)

     This is the ONLY difference from the generic body on the way in, and the
     postcondition's [IcacheEscrow.ic_tx_dep] is the only one on the way
     out.  A caller that brings [LogInv.log_tx] gets the WRITE ARM: half
     its transaction's element is parked in the escrow's checked-out arm for
     the whole locked window, so [end_op] -- which consumes the whole element
     -- cannot commit while this inode is out, which is exactly what the
     collection at quiescence reads off the escrow
     ([IcacheEscrow.ic_out_no_write_arm]).  The other half rides home inside
     [ic_tx_dep], so a walk that threads the descriptor through its stages
     threads the residue with it and NO stage lemma gains a binder.

     WHAT IT COSTS THE WALK: between here and its [iunlock] it holds no
     transaction token at all, so every interior contract it calls must be
     the [log_opS]/GEN form ([SpecWritei], [SpecIupdate], [SpecItrunc],
     [SpecDirlink], [SpecBmap], [SpecBalloc], [SpecBfree],
     [SpecIunlockput]).  Every one of them already has it. *)

Module Type ILOCK.
  (* THE GENERIC FORM (durable-disk B''-tx3): ONE proof of ilock's code, the
     checkout's descriptor chosen by the caller.  [wp_ilock_tx_sconf] below
     is its [DepTx] reading ([wp_ilock_tx_of_dep]); a READ-locker
     ([fileread], [filestat]) uses it at [DepRd] directly, which is what
     retires [ic_shed_rd] at those two sites. *)

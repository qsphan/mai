(* ProofUsertrapTail.v -- usertrap's TAIL: the three blocks every arm ends
   in, plus the exit disassembly.

     +0xa6   if (killed(p)) { which_dev = 0; kexit(-1); }        <- ut_a6
     +0xae   prepare_return();
             uint64 satp = MAKE_SATP(p->pagetable);
             <epilogue>; return satp;                            <- ut_ret
     +0xfc   if (which_dev == 2) yield();  goto +0xae             <- ut_fa

   WHY THIS IS THE FIRST FILE OF THE WALK, and why it is index-GENERIC.
   +0xa6 is reached at [b = true] from the syscall arm (whose [csrsi
   sstatus,2] at +0x9e re-enabled interrupts) and at [b = false] from the
   devintr / vmfault / unexpected-scause arms.  Every callee it reaches is
   already index-generic -- killed, kexit, prepare_return, yield -- so the
   three blocks are proved ONCE over a parameter [b], and the four arms above
   instantiate them.  That is also why [UsertrapRes.ut_hold] exists: at
   [b = true] the trap-CSR set and the running claim live inside [sie_arm]
   and the caller brings [emp], at [b = false] it brings them itself, and
   [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] are exactly that difference.

   THE ONE THING THE TAIL HAS TO GET RIGHT IS THE EXIT, and it is not the
   epilogue's four loads.  It is that the machine state prepare_return hands
   back re-assembles [SpecUsertrap]'s boundary: the sret-ready mstatus is
   DERIVED, not arranged ([UsertrapRes.ut_exit_ms_ok]), from the loose SIE
   quarter's agreement with [sconf]'s half and the travelling sret mirror's
   with [sconf]'s tie -- so the two ghost fractions the excursion through user
   mode parks are what makes the return legal.  See UsertrapRes.v's header.

   [mf] IS [tp_pin] OF THE FINAL MAP, which is the cheapest way to meet the
   boundary's [mf !!! tp = cid_word]: usertrap may have MIGRATED, so the tp
   SLOT of the map it has been threading still holds the entry hart's id
   while [gpr_file] holds the pinned one.  Handing over [tp_pin M] makes the
   two agree by construction ([HartTp.tp_pin_id]), and tp is deliberately not
   one of [CalleeSaved.callee_saved]'s thirteen, so nothing else moves. *)

  (* ITS OWN SECTION, WHICH IS THE POINT.  prepare_return's post is a
     [wp_next b p] crossing, so everything from +0xb2 on runs on a hart that
     may not be the one usertrap was entered on -- and [CpuId] is a CLASS, so
     a leaf applied inside the caller's section resolves its hart by INSTANCE
     RESOLUTION and picks the section variable, not the hypothesis's hart.
     Annotating every leaf with [(CID := ...)] works and is what the tier does
     for one or two steps; for a fifteen-instruction stretch the honest move is
     durable-notes' "the chaining lemma needs its OWN section": stated here,
     the ambient [CID] IS the post-crossing hart and not one annotation is
     needed.  [ut_ret] below applies it at [(CID := CIDp)]. *)

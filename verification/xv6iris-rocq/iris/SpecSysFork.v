     +0x12  8082        c.ret

   THE POINT OF THIS SPEC is that it is a THIN one, and that it is now
   POSSIBLE to state.  sys_fork is a pure forwarder -- gcc emits no cast at
   all, so [a0] comes back from kfork and leaves untouched -- so everything
   interesting is in [SpecKfork], and this contract's only job is to prove
   that a syscall-altitude caller can actually PAY what kfork asks.  That
   was not true until [ProcInv.cwd_ref] became real: kfork used to carry
   five icache premises (an [IcacheInv.inode_ref] on the entry [p->cwd]
   names, an [IrefSlots.iref_slot], and the slot / device / inum that went
   with them) which NO CALLER COULD DISCHARGE, and this file could not have
   been written.  The parent's reference now comes out of its own
   [proc_priv] and the iref unit out of allocproc's block, so what is left
   is only what a caller genuinely holds.

   WHAT IS LEFT, and none of it is kfork-specific: the interrupt/nesting
   bundle ([sie_cap_gpr], [cpu_own]), the caller's own private block
   ([proc_priv], handed back verbatim -- kfork only READS the parent), the
   allocator at [kalloc_env _ None], four persistent handles (the process
   table, the nextpid and wait_lock spinlocks, the ftable and the itable),
   and ONE LINEAR RESOURCE: the child's user-execution slot, which is
   kfork's own premise passed straight through.  The forking process
   deposited it at the ecall and the trap route carried it here
   ([SpecUsertrap.ut_fork_in] / [SpecSyscall.sysc_fork_in]), so sys_fork
   mints nothing.  The last two travel with the FS fabric ([fsc_fs], [fsc_cov],
   [fsc_logst], [nib]) because [IcacheEscrow.is_itable2]'s resource does;
   kfork does no I/O and touches no log, and inherits them only because its
   [idup] call takes the itable lock.  A syscall dispatcher that already
   holds the fs fabric -- which every FS syscall does -- pays nothing extra.

   THE RETURN VALUE is kfork's, unchanged: [-1] on either failure arm, or
   the child's pid sign-extended exactly as [c.lw]/[c.mv a0,s1] left it.
   The disjunction is restated here rather than projected out of
   [kfork_post], because the caller of a syscall wrapper should not have to
   know that predicate's shape.

   THE STACK BUDGET is cumulative and this frame is 2 slots:
   [K_kfork + 2 <= av].  [K_sys_fork] names the total. *)

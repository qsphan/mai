(* SpecPanic.v -- panic()'s contract.

     void panic(char *s) {
       printk("panic: ");
       printk("%s\n", s);
       for (;;) ;
     }

   NO POSTCONDITION.  panic never returns -- its last instruction is a
   self-jump -- so the contract is a bare [mWP Loop] with no continuation at
   all, and a caller that reaches panic has thereby discharged its own goal.
   That is what makes a panic arm cheap to close, and it is the one thing
   [PanicStub.panic_wp] (the placeholder this replaces) already got right.

   THE PRECONDITION IS FORCED BY THE TWO printk CALLS, which are ordinary
   calls with an ordinary contract ([SpecPrintk.PRINTK]).  Four parts:

   06ea57f COMMENTED THE TWO CALLS OUT and 163d39b PUT THEM BACK.  The
   stopgap ("no console output on panic, for now") existed only to get the
   UART out of panic's cone; upstream replaced it with a SECOND UART, so
   panic prints again.  Nothing in this contract's SHAPE moved across either
   bump -- parts 1-3 were left standing when the calls went (a premise that
   is merely unused is still provable, a stack bound that is not tight is
   still a bound), so they are already exactly what the restored calls want.
   Only part 4 ever changed, and it changes back.

   1. THE MESSAGE.  [a0] is the vararg of a "%s" directive, so it is described
      exactly as printk describes one: a [pk_arg_desc] of kind [PkStr] -- a
      [char *] to a string the caller owns ([PkAStr dq s], handed over and
      never returned, there being nothing to return it to) or a null pointer
      ([PkANull], which printk prints as "(null)").  Every panic site in xv6
      passes a .rodata literal, so the obligation is discharged by
      [KernelDataInv.kernel_data_string] out of [kernel_data], which the
      caller already holds.

   2. THE STACK.  panic pushes a 32-byte frame (4 slots) and then calls
      printk, whose own budget is [SpecPrintk.printk_stack] = 52; hence
      [panic_stack] = 56.  Both numbers rose by four at this bump -- see the
      note at [panic_stack] below.

   3. THE INTERRUPT/LOCK ACCOUNTING.  printk takes pr.lock, and UART1's
      tx_lock under it, so the caller's [cpu_own n eb p C b] is required --
      and consumed -- together with the [n + 2] headroom printk asks for.  Unlike printk's own
      [n], panic's is arbitrary: a panic arm is normally reached with locks
      already held.

   4. [panic_env], the persistent credentials printk needs, bundled so a call
      site threads one hypothesis and not four: pr.lock's [is_lock] (whose
      resource is [emp] -- see [SpecPrintk.pr_res]) and
      [SpecPrputc.prputc_env], the SECOND PORT's credential.  06ea57f emptied
      this to [emp]; 163d39b REFILLS it, because printk's precondition asks
      for both again and neither is mintable -- an [is_lock] and a
      [uart_inv] can only be handed down from the boot chain that created
      them.  Refilling costs no call site anything for the same reason
      emptying did not: the premise never left [wp_panic_sconf_body], and the
      ninety specs that name it were never swept, so every one of them still
      threads a real [panic_env] through to here.

      AND IT IS THE SECOND PORT'S, NOT THE CONSOLE'S.  What sat here before
      06ea57f was the console triple ([dev_inv], the console's [is_txlock],
      its DLAB).  panic prints through [prputc] now, so the credential names
      [uart_inv Uart1], `&uarts[1].tx_lock` and `uarts[1].base` -- and
      [WpUart.dev_inv] could not be reused even in principle, being the
      CONSOLE BUNDLE by definition ([uart_inv Uart0] + PLIC + disk).

      AND NOT A TRACE CLAIM, nor any other claim about what came out.
      Nothing tracks the second port's wire (claude-notes/projects/
      xv6-bump-163d39b.md, "THE OWNER'S RULING: UART1's output is
      unconstrained"), so printk's contract no longer threads a trace claim
      at all and there is nothing for panic to supply or to report.  This
      file used to explain why the [bs] accumulator was pointless HERE (no
      postcondition to feed); it is now pointless everywhere in the cone, and
      the empty-trace mint [ProofPanic] used to run
      is gone with it.

   AND THERE IS NO LONGER A PREMISE THAT IS NOT ABOUT panic.  This contract
   used to ask for [PanicStub.panic_wp_any] as well, because printk's own
   precondition asked for it (acquire's "already holding" arm) and panic had
   to hand printk one -- the C-level panic -> printk -> acquire -> panic cycle
   showing through.  The plan of record was to close that cycle by Löb once
   the call sites were spliced over.  IT DID NOT NEED TO BE CLOSED: acquire's
   arm is refuted now (SpecAcquire.v), so the whole printk cone -- printk,
   printint, consputc, uartputc_sync -- asks for no panic credential at all,
   and panic's contract is self-contained.  What is left of the splice is the
   NINE functions that reach a [jal panic] of their own on a LIVE arm (bread,
   ilock, iget, dirlookup, dirlink, fileread, filewriteParts, kexit (two arms),
   kexecB2) -- kvmmap left the list when SpecKvmmap went counted-only. *)

   the bump forced.  Nothing about panic's own frame moved; uartputc_sync's

  (* ---- THE GHOST NAMES ARE EXISTENTIAL, AND NOTHING IS LOST BY IT --------
     A call site threads ONE nameless persistent token; no spec below panic
     gains a parameter.  Two independent reasons this is not a weakening.

     LOGICALLY it is an equivalence, not an approximation.  With the
     trace premise gone (see the header), every name occurs EXACTLY
     ONCE in [wp_panic_sconf_body] -- inside this one conjunct (γpr here, the
     UART1 pair inside [prputc_env]) -- and none occurs in the conclusion,
     which is the bare [mWP Loop].  So [(∀ γ⃗, panic_env_at γ⃗ -∗ WP Loop)] and
     [((∃ γ⃗, panic_env_at γ⃗) -∗ WP Loop)] are interderivable by
     ∃-elimination.  Contrast [SpecConsoleintr.console_caps], which binds its
     two LOCK names but keeps [γu] a parameter for precisely the missing
     reason: its [γu] occurs again, in the contract proper.

     PHYSICALLY a caller cannot supply a bogus port, even though the logic
     cannot state uniqueness.  Every name is pinned by an exclusive physical
     resource: [lock_inv γ lk s R] contains [lock_word lk v], the lock word
     itself, so γpr is determined by the address [pk_pr_lock] that this very
     definition names and UART1's lock name by [UartsFields.uart_f_lock
     Uart1]; and [uart_inv Uart1]'s body holds [uart_frag Uart1 u], the ghost
     half of the PHYSICAL device state paired with [uarts_auth] inside
     [state_interp], so at most one bundle can have a live [uart_inv Uart1]
     at all.

     What each name is: γpr keys nothing but pr.lock's held-state ghost (its
     resource is [emp]); the UART1 lock name keys its own, whose resource is
     [tx_res γ1] -- keyed by the UART bundle, not by the lock name; and γ1 is
     the only one indexing real resources ([uart_tx_own], [uart_sent],
     [uart_dlab_off]) -- all of them at a port nothing above reads. *)
  (* ---- 06ea57f EMPTIED THIS TO [emp]; 163d39b REFILLS IT --------------
     The stopgap bump had panic print nothing, so it needed no UART
     credential and this was [emp] -- the cheap way to shed a resource
     without moving a call site.  163d39b restores the two printk calls, so
     the credential is REAL again.

     THAT COSTS NO CALL SITE ANYTHING EITHER, for exactly the reason
     emptying did not: the premise never left [wp_panic_sconf_body], and
     the ninety specs that name it were never swept, so every site still
     threads a genuine token down to here.  Refilling the definition is a
     one-file change with no fan-out; what a bump must never do is DELETE
     the definition or DROP the premise.

     AND IT HAD TO BE REFILLED, not merely re-attached: [ProofPanic] cannot
     mint either conjunct.  An [is_lock] and a [uart_inv] are handed down
     from the boot chain that created them and nothing below can conjure one.
     The credential is where they come from.  (What [ProofPanic] COULD mint
     -- the empty trace claim -- is exactly what the cone stopped
     wanting, so that mint is gone rather than kept.)

     A SITE THAT CARRIES [panic_env] IS EVIDENCE AGAIN.  Between the two
     bumps it was not -- the token was weightless and a site holding one
     proved nothing about its cone -- so read a pre-163d39b judgement about
     what "needs the console" with that in mind; and read the word "console"
     with care, because what a panic site now proves it can reach is the
     SECOND port. *)

(* IcacheHeld.v -- THE SAME REFERENCE, KEYED BY THE POINTER A REGISTER HOLDS,
   AND THE CONTEXT TRANSPORTS.

   [IcacheRef.v] states a reference at the SLOT INDEX [k]; a walk holds an
   [ip] in a register.  [inode_held v] is the existential over [k] that ties
   the two together through [ientry], and every walk-level spec is stated
   over it.  It is a file of its own because the layer below it -- the whole
   fs invariant spine, [InodeRegion] / [IgetLic] / [IcacheInv] and the boot
   chain -- never mentions a held POINTER at all: those files reach for the
   ledger and the slot-keyed predicates, and on the build's critical path
   they used to wait for these three hundred lines of [Timeless] instances
   and splits before they could start.

   The second half is the M1-flip transports ([CtxMorph]): [inode_ident]'s
   two cells are [↦₄], so every predicate over them re-indexes along
   [ctx_dom] rather than being ξ-constant.  They live beside [inode_held]
   because [FileInvDefs]'s payload chain -- the only consumer that needs the
   transports -- needs the pointer-keyed forms too.

   This file re-exports [IcacheRef.v] (hence [IcacheRefDefs.v]), so a
   consumer that names anything from either still requires exactly one
   file. *)

  (* A REFERENCE, KEYED BY THE POINTER a caller actually holds -- the form
     [FileInv]'s payload and [ProcInv.cwd_ref] carry, and the exact
     analogue of [PipeInv.pipe_held].  The slot, the share and the inum are
     existential because nothing at the file-table altitude names them;
     [ientry_inj] makes the slot a function of the pointer anyway, and the
     three facts a consumer needs -- that [v] IS an entry, that the entry is
     in range, and that the inum is one the inode region covers -- travel
     with it as pure conjuncts.  The device and the authority are NOT
     existential: they are the cache's, and a consumer that has to match
     them against an [ic_names] does so with a pure premise. *)
  (* THE REFERENCE's PROVENANCE UNIT RIDES INSIDE THE PACKAGE (item 7a-wire,
     iclaim-ledger.md §5''.3's step 6).  §5''.3 names two REST HOMES for the
     unit -- [FileInv]'s fd slot and the proc invariant's [p->cwd] -- and
     both of them, together with every TRAVELLING reference in the walker
     cone ([SpecNamex] / [SpecNamei] / [SpecNameiparent] / [SpecCreate] all
     return one), package their reference as [inode_held].  So the token
     lives HERE, at the package, rather than being spelled beside it at each
     home: one edit, and not one of those contracts changes shape.
     The FLAVOUR is existential -- a holder does not care which licence paid
     for its reference, only that it has the unit iput will demand.
     RESTATED OVER THE PACKAGE (SIMP-2): the last two conjuncts ARE
     [inode_refp], on the nose -- [inode_refp]'s single delta step is the
     pair that used to be spelled here, so every landed positional
     unpacking of [inode_held] reads exactly as before. *)
  (* HELD INUMS ARE POSITIVE (round E2-L0): a dirent whose inum is 0 is a
     FREE slot ([DirView.dir_live]), so a reference to inode 0 never exists
     -- the root is 1, dirlookup skips free records, ialloc's post has
     [0 < inum].  The lower bound rides beside the upper one, as its own
     pure conjunct, so every landed positional unpacking gains exactly one
     binder right after the bound it already names. *)

  (* ---- THE SAME TWO SHAPES FOR A SHARE, AND FOR A PARKED SHORT PARENT ----

     [FileInv]'s FD_INODE payload is "a reference parked in a cancellable
     invariant, SHORT by a per-slot constant, with the complement travelling
     as a share beside every holder's cancel token" (design §14.6's third
     shape).  Both halves of that live at the FILE TABLE's altitude, which
     names an inode by its POINTER and has no vocabulary for a slot -- so both
     need the same pointer->slot bridge [inode_held] already carries, and for
     the same reason: [ientry_inj] makes the slot a function of the pointer,
     so hiding it existentially is lossless.  The three pure conjuncts (the
     pointer IS an entry, the entry is in range, the inum is one the inode
     region covers) are [inode_held]'s verbatim.

     [inode_held_short] states the shortfall with a pure equation rather than
     as [inode_ref_short k (qi + s) qi] so that instantiating it never has to
     rewrite under a binder: the carve produces [q/2 + q/2] and the closer
     wants [q], and [Qp.div_2] is then a side condition rather than a rewrite
     in the goal. *)

     it: the share already pins the inum, through [inode_ident]'s points-to
     on the entry's own [i_inum] cell, so the quantifier hid a fact the
     resource carried anyway.  Naming it is what lets a file descriptor's
     user-visible state say WHICH FILE it is open on
     ([FdSlots.FdInode], [FileInvDefs.fdstate_ok]), and that is the only

  (* ---- THE FLOORS LAW (endgame section 9, items 16/17; 2026-09-02) -----

     THE FLOORED BUNDLES DO TRANSPORT, and the note that used to stand here
     -- "a [cred_floor] is a fact about the holder's own context and does
     not re-index" -- was reading the credential one binder too narrowly.
     [cred_floor lo tl] is a DISJUNCTION and its UPPER index [tl] is
     ∃-BOUND by every bundle that carries it ([live_fracc],
     [inode_shr_held_gen], [inode_ref_short_gen]'s ∃-form): so a receiver
     may RE-CHOOSE it, and [tl := lo] is always a legal choice
     ([lo <= lo]).  The left arm lands on the receiver's left arm
     ([TsoCtx.ctx_floor_dom] keeps [tl]); the right arm lands on whichever
     arm the domination justifies the author's own message at
     ([TsoCtx.ctx_dom_wrote_floor] gives [ctx_floor ξ' lo] or the
     receiver's own [ctx_wrote ξ' lo a]), and the credential has both --
     which is exactly [WpLock.lk_floor_morph]'s argument, one existential
     lower down.

     Nothing else in these bundles moves: [live_genlo], [iref_frag],
     [slh_tok] and the stamps are ghost state, and the only cells are
     [inode_ident]'s two [↦₄]s ([inode_ident_morph] above). *)

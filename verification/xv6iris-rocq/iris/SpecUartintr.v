(* SpecUartintr.v -- the public interface of uartintr, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void uartintr(int uid);

   A 16550's interrupt handler, called from devintr().  At XV6_REV 163d39b the
   kernel drives TWO ports out of one `struct uart uarts[2]`, so the handler
   gained a PORT INDEX: the contract is parametric in [i : uart_id] and the
   only premise about [uid] is that a0 holds [uart_index i].  Everything the
   handler reaches -- the MMIO window, the sleep channel, the receive hook --
   it reaches through `&uarts[uid]`, which is why [SpecUartPutc.uart_base_word
   i] and [UartTxInv.uart_rx_word i] are premises: the base and the hook are
   LOADED from .data, not compile-time constants, and those two persistent
   VA-tier snapshots are what say what the two words hold.

   It acknowledges the interrupt (an ISR read), then does two independent
   things, both at port [i]:

     TX: if LSR says the transmitter is idle, [wakeup(u)] -- and the sleep
         channel is the ELEMENT `&uarts[uid]` now, not the departed `&tx_chan`;
     RX: drain the receive FIFO one byte at a time via uartgetc() -- which gcc
         still INLINES, so it has no symbol of its own -- and feed each byte to
         `u->rx` IF THAT HOOK IS NON-NULL.

   THE HOOK IS DECIDED PER PORT, NOT AT RUN TIME.  `uarts[0].rx` is
   [consoleintr] and `uarts[1].rx` is 0, both written by the loader and by
   nobody else, so [UartTxInv.uart_rx_word i] settles the `if (u->rx)`
   guard statically: at [Uart0] the `c.jalr` is an ordinary call to
   consoleintr, at [Uart1] the branch is provably taken and the call is dead
   code.  That is what [ui_rx_caps] below expresses -- the console's
   credential is owed only at the port that has one.

   @ KernelSyms.uartintr, 128 bytes, 47 instructions, a 32-byte frame of
   which only THREE slots are written (ra/s0/s1; s2 is no longer used and the
   lowest slot is dead, so it rides the proof existentially).

   THIS IS THE OTHER HALF OF [UartTxInv.tx_res] at port [i].  uartwrite polls
   THRE for itself, so nothing is cashed here: every read this function makes
   is ghost-free as far as the transmitter is concerned
   ([DevModel.uart_read_stable]: no UART read moves [uart_acc], the
   transmitted prefix or DLAB).  The RECEIVE side is not ghost-free -- the RHR
   read POPS the FIFO -- which is what [uart_rx_writer] is for, and it is
   needed AT BOTH PORTS: `uartgetc(u)` runs at port 1 too and discards what it
   pops, so the token is unconditional even though the console credential is
   not.

   WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS: nothing about the output, at either port.  An
   interrupt handler's job is to leave the caller's state alone, and that is
   what is promised -- every callee-saved register, the interrupt-nesting
   level, and the register file's totality.  The rx loop is UNBOUNDED (the
   device may keep supplying bytes), so the WP is, as always, partial
   correctness.

   Callees: wakeup, and -- at the console port only -- consoleintr. *)

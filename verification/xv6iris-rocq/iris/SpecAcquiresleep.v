(* SpecAcquiresleep.v -- the public interface of Acquiresleep, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

   The separation-logic lock spec, sleeplock flavour:

     { is_sleeplock γl γ slk s R ∗ <thread resources> }
       acquiresleep(slk)
     { sleeplocked γ slk pid ∗ R ∗ <thread resources> }

   The <thread resources> are what the body's callees demand: the per-cpu
   push_off cells and the inner lock's cpu word (acquire/release), the
   current-process resource and the caller's own pid cell at a read
   fraction (lk->pid = myproc()->pid), and -- because the wait loop parks
   through sleep() -- the running-thread bundle of the scheduler protocol
   (SpecSleep.v).  Entered with no spinlocks held (intr_count 0, noff cell
   0): sleep() requires exactly one level outstanding, which forces it.

   FIVE CONTRACTS, IN THREE PAIRS OF ONE IDEA.  Each of the two blocking
   levels -- level 0 and the NESTED one iput needs -- is stated once over the
   sleeplock's holder DEPOSIT [H : Qp -> iProp Σ] (SleepLock.v) and once at
   the untracked instance [H := sl_untracked], [q := 1], which is what every
   existing caller takes and which reads exactly as it did before the deposit
   existed.  The fifth, [wp_acquiresleep_nb_body], is the NON-BLOCKING nested
   contract: same postcondition, but its precondition is evidence that the
   lock is FREE rather than a lock-order bound, so its wait loop is refuted
   rather than proved.  See the block above it. *)

(*  THE HOLDER DEPOSIT [H] (SleepLock.v), AND WHY IT IS ON THE CONTRACT.

   Taking a sleeplock leaves a resource of the acquirer's OWN inside it --
   [H q], where [q] is the fraction of the "may hold this lock" right the
   caller is spending.  Nothing else can be refutable from outside: what a
   would-be prover of "this lock is FREE" holds is a frame for the acquire's
   ghost step, so a held arm manufactured out of the free arm alone survives
   that frame (SleepLock.v's header).  releasesleep hands the same fraction
   back, pinned by the holder's token [sleeplocked_q γsl q].

   [wp_acquiresleep_sconf_body] below is this at the UNTRACKED instance
   ([H := sl_untracked], [q := 1]), where the deposit is [emp] and the
   fraction is invisible -- which is exactly what every existing caller
   (bget, ilock) takes, unchanged.  The tracked instance ([H := slh_tok γsl])
   is what makes [wp_acquiresleep_nb_body] at the foot of this file possible. *)

   publish a contract entered at noff >= 2, whose LOCKED branch was the wait
   loop: sleep_prepare / release / sleep / acquire, forever, with
   [sleep] at noff >= 2 reaching sched() and panic("sched locks").  It was
   provable ONLY because [SpecSleep] offered that panic as an arm.

   Its sole consumer was iput, and iput now takes the NON-BLOCKING contract
   below.  So every acquiresleep that can SLEEP is entered at noff = 0
   ([wp_acquiresleep_gen_sconf]'s [cpu_own 0]), sleep's own acquire puts it
   at exactly noff = 1 for the call to sched, and sched's "sched locks"
   panic became unreachable rather than permitted -- SpecSched.v now has no
   noff <> 1 contract at all.

(* ===================================================================== *)
(* A BLOCKING acquiresleep's wait loop reaches [sleep_prepare], which acquires
   [p->lock] at "proc" (9).  A caller that already holds a lock ABOVE
   "sleep lock" -- [iput] holds "itable" (14) -- can hand it no such bound,
   and none is true.  That was the whole content of the FALSE axiom
   [ProofIput.iput_acquiresleep_order_ADMITTED], now discharged
   (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md).

   THE DISCHARGE CHANGES THE OBLIGATION.  Here the caller instead presents
   [slh_auth γt None], the AUTHORITATIVE ZERO of the object's
   outstanding-share count: no share of the "may hold this lock" right exists
   anywhere, so no deposit sits in the lock, so the [lk->locked != 0] arm of
   [sl_res_gen] is REFUTED at the leaf that reads the word.  The loop is not
   proved, it is unreachable -- so [sleep_prepare] is never reached, so no
   order premise is raised, and all that is left of the held-set precondition
   is what the interior [acquire(&slk->lk)]'s ghost step consumes:
   [SpecAcquire]'s FRESH tier, ["sleep lock" ∉ lks].

   WHAT COMES BACK.  The deposit this call makes is minted from the zero on
   the way in, so the caller leaves with [slh_auth γsl (Some q)] beside its
   holder token; [SleepLock.slh_return_last] turns that back into the zero
   once releasesleep returns the share.

   The sleep cone is gone from the contract with the loop: no [procs_inv], no
   [γs], no [j < NPROC].  What is left is the prologue, the entry acquire, the
   [locked := 1] / [pid := myproc()->pid] stores and the interior release.

   THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO TAKE A SLEEPLOCK WITH A SPINLOCK HELD.  The
   blocking contracts are all at [cpu_own 0], which is what makes sched's
   [noff != 1] panic unreachable from here. *)

   the NB core with the inner acquire at the llb tier: the caller's [llb Tl]

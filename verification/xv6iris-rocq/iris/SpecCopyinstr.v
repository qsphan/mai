(* SpecCopyinstr.v -- the public interface of copyinstr(), stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never
   a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

     int copyinstr(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 psz, char *dst,
                   uint64 srcva, uint64 max) {
       int got_null = 0;
       while (got_null == 0 && max > 0) {
         va0 = PGROUNDDOWN(srcva);
         pa0 = walkaddr(pagetable, va0);
         if (pa0 == 0 && (pa0 = vmfault(pagetable, psz, va0, 1)) == 0) return -1;
         n = PGSIZE - (srcva - va0);  if (n > max) n = max;
         char *p = (char * )(pa0 + (srcva - va0));
         while (n > 0) {
           if ( *p == '\0') { *dst = '\0'; got_null = 1; break; }
           else *dst = *p;
           --n; --max; p++; dst++;
         }
         srcva = va0 + PGSIZE;
       }
       return got_null ? 0 : -1;
     }

   The third member of the copyin / copyout family.  It used to be much the
   cheapest of the three to state, for two reasons; xv6 `4f2fc8b` took the
   first of them away.

   1. *** IT FAULTS PAGES IN NOW. ***  walkaddr used to be copyinstr's only
      callee and an unmapped page was simply [-1], so this contract needed
      no vmfault, no kalloc tier, no [cpu_own], no size and no [uptd_ext]:
      the descriptor that came back was the descriptor that went in.  The
      [pa0 == 0] arm now calls [vmfault(pagetable, psz, va0, 1)] exactly as
      copyin's does, which lifts copyinstr to the same altitude as the rest
      of the family: it takes [kalloc_env] and [cpu_own], and hands back a
      descriptor EXTENDING the one it was given ([uptd_ext_sz szv], every
      gained entry below [szv]).  Read SpecCopyin.v's header for the tier;
      the two now differ only in what the DESTINATION gets (point 2).

      The [psz] parameter arrives in a1, shifting dst/srcva/max down to
      a2/a3/a4, and the frame grew to 12 slots -- so [K] is the family's 50
      rather than the old 20.

   2. IT DOES NOT CALL memmove.  The copy is an inline byte loop, which is
      what makes a CONTENTS postcondition possible at all.  This is now the
      ONLY thing that distinguishes copyinstr from copyin.

   WHAT THE BUFFER GETS.  Two promises, both on the success arm, and
   together they are the whole of what distinguishes copyinstr from copyin.

   The STRUCTURE is [ByteBuf.bb_cstr f k]: the buffer holds a NUL-terminated
   string, the NUL sitting at [k] and nowhere before it, so [k] is the length
   strlen will report and [k < max] says the terminator landed inside the
   caller's buffer.  Without that clause the function would be useless --
   fetchstr runs strlen over the result.

   The CONTENT is [copyinstr_got M srcva f k]: byte [j] of the buffer, for
   every [j] up to and INCLUDING the terminator, is the byte the process has
   at [srcva + j].  copyin's [SpecCopyin.copyin_got] one member of the family
   over, and it lands for the same reason -- the process's memory is NAMED at
   this altitude, so the loop that reads a byte off a borrowed page is
   reading a byte [M] already records.  What it buys a caller is the identity
   of the string rather than merely its shape: exec asks WHICH path its user
   passed, and only a memory-indexed answer can say.

   The failure arm stays information-free, exactly as in the rest of the
   family: [-1] means an unbackable page or [max] bytes with no NUL among
   them, and no caller distinguishes them.

   NOTE WHAT THE FAULT PATH DOES NOT DISTURB: [bb_cstr] is a property of the
   DESTINATION buffer, which lives in kernel memory and which vmfault never
   touches, and [copyinstr_got] is stated at the [M] that comes back
   unchanged.  So the success arm survives the fault path whole, and only the
   page-table and kalloc resources move. *)

(* THE COPIED BYTES ARE THE PROCESS'S.  Byte [j] of the destination, for
   every [j] up to and INCLUDING the terminator at [k], is the byte the image
   [M] has at [srcva + j].  ONE clause at [j <= k] rather than a run plus a
   separate NUL: [bb_cstr f k] already says [f k] is the NUL, so the [j = k]
   instance IS "the image has a NUL at [srcva + k]", and the pair always
   travels together (they are conjuncts of the same success arm below).  That
   is also the spelling [SpecSysExec.exec_args_of] reads an argument string
   at, so the two meet with no translation.

   The index arithmetic is the machine's -- [add_vec_int], modulo 2^64 --
   because that is what the copy loop's cursor does; [SpecCopyin.copyin_got]
   counts the same way. *)

   function usable -- it carries BOTH promises at the one [k], which is what

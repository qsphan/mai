(* Ktier.v -- the KERNEL-TRANSLATION TIER of a datum, and the ambient tier
   class.  A pure file: no project imports, nothing but the two-point
   lattice, its order class, and the ambient-tier class the notations
   elaborate through (claude-notes/projects/sp-migration.md, design §1/§4/§6).

   THE CONCEPT.  A kernel memory datum ([RiscvPtsto.mem_pointsto] and the
   towers over it) owns the byte at the PHYSICAL address the kernel mapping
   takes its va to.  Whether that ownership can DRIVE a load or store
   depends on the translation regime the accessing hart is running:

   - [KT0] -- usable through the BOOT IDENTITY MAP.  The datum carries a
     PIN ([RiscvPtsto.ktier_pin]) saying its va translates to itself, so a
     hart running with translation OFF (Bare -- every hart before its own
     [kvminithart], which for a secondary is the whole printk/console/uart/
     lock cone) reads exactly the byte the datum owns.  Every [↦ₘ] in the
     tree is at a statically classified address today, so the whole tree is
     KT0 and the identity pin is the conjunct it has always carried.
   - [KT1] -- requires the FULL KERNEL TABLE.  No pin at all: the datum's va
     may map anywhere (a KSTACK page, the trampoline).  Driving a leaf with
     it needs the per-hart witness that this hart has published the kernel
     table ([SRegime.sr_kwit] / [IntrDefs.kpt_on]); that is phase D.

   So the tier is a LOWER BOUND on the accessing hart's translation
   generation, and [KtierLe] is the order: [KT0] facts are usable
   everywhere, a KT1 hart honours every claim.

   THE AMBIENT TIER.  [CurKtier] is the "which tier does an unadorned [↦ₘ]
   mean here" class: the family's ordinary spellings ([a ↦ₘ v], [a ↦₈ w],
   [stack_own sp n], ...) take it as an instance-implicit argument, so a
   file selects its tier ONCE, with a [Local Instance], and its spec text
   is unchanged.  Explicit-tier statements use the bracket spellings
   ([a ↦ₘ[KT1] v]) or the named argument [(KTR := kt)].

   DELIBERATE DEVIATION from the weak-memory branch's [CtxIdDefs.CurCtx], which has
   ZERO instances by design: [CurKtier] carries a GLOBAL DEFAULT [KT0] at
   LOW priority (100), so any local pin beats it regardless of declaration
   order and the ~430 use-only consumer files need no annotation at all.
   This is sound because the default's failure direction is UNPROVABILITY,
   never unsoundness: a file that should have said KT1 and forgot gets a
   KT0 datum, whose pin it then cannot establish -- a stuck goal, not a bad
   proof.  (The reverse -- a KT1 default -- WOULD be unsound-shaped: it
   would silently drop the identity pin the Bare arm's [sr_adm] discharge
   rests on.  Do not flip it.)

   BINDER NAMING: the section/lemma binder for a [CurKtier] is [KTR].
   NEVER [GEN] -- [GEN : GenId] (the kexec era index) is pre-existing and
   widely threaded. *)

(* the two-point lattice.  Kept a dedicated type (not [bool]) so the
   weak-memory merge can grow it without re-spelling every site; if it ever
   does grow, replace the three [KtierLe] instances below with a decision
   procedure -- {bot, top, refl} is complete for TWO points only. *)

(* WHICH INSTANCE FIRES WHEN THE DATUM TIER IS STILL AN EVAR, AND WHY THE
   ANSWER IS [ktier_le_refl].  A memory leaf is applied as
   [iApply (leaf ... with "Hcg [Hd]")]: the datum premise becomes a SUBGOAL,
   so at the moment the application elaborates, the goal is
   [KtierLe ?ktd kt] with the datum's tier undetermined.  Search fires
   EAGERLY and takes [ktier_le_refl], i.e. [?ktd := kt] -- the datum is
   assumed to sit at the ACCESSING HART's own regime.  That is the right
   default (a frame slot peeled off the capability, anything the function
   owns), and it is why the leaves need no annotation at their ~1800
   stack-slot call sites.  A datum at a DIFFERENT tier -- static image data
   under a tier-generic hart -- must say so, and the annotation is TWO
   named arguments, [(kt := kt) (ktd := KT0)], not one: at a call site the
   HART's tier is an implicit argument too, so [ktier_le_refl] ties the two
   together and pinning only [ktd] drags the capability's tier along with
   it (the symptom is [iSpecialize: cannot instantiate (sie_cap_gpr KT0 ...)]).
   [KT0] and not [cur_ktier]: [cur_ktier] is [Typeclasses Opaque], so
   instance search cannot see through it to [ktier_le_bot] and the whole
   application fails to elaborate.

   DO NOT "FIX" THIS WITH [Hint Mode KtierLe ! -].  It was measured: the
   mode does defer resolution so a bracket's [iExact] can pin the tier, but
   an [ltac:(...)] splice in argument position forces the application to
   elaborate strictly, and a mode-blocked goal is then reported as
   "Could not find an instance for KtierLe ?ktd kt" rather than shelved.
   1444 of the tree's 2640 leaf call sites pass a pure premise that way, so
   the mode turns a silent over-constraint into a hard error at more than
   half of them.  Moving the [KtierLe] binder to the end of the leaf's
   telescope changes nothing either (the whole application elaborates before
   any subgoal is touched), and stating the order as a PURE premise is worse
   still: the resulting goal is emitted BEFORE the datum's, where its tier
   is not yet known. *)

   but Coq's INSTANCE unification does not unfold the class, so a goal
   [KtierLe KTR KTR] matches none of the three above and reports "Unable to
   unify CurKtier with ktier".  These cover exactly that case and cannot
   perturb the literal ones (their conclusions unify only when the tier
   argument is already typed at [CurKtier]).  Same root cause as the
   pointsto family's [Persistent]/[Timeless] instances, which must bind
   their tier as a plain [(ktr : CurKtier)] for the mirror-image reason:
   a BACKTICK CLASS binder is resolved by instance SEARCH (so it only ever
   produces the KT0 default) and a [(ktr : ktier)] binder cannot take a
   [CurKtier] argument. *)

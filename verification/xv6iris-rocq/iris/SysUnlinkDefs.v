(* SysUnlinkDefs.v -- the UNLINK family's STATEMENT LEAF: the fused
   delta's side conditions, its two-instant split, and the FOUR commit
   steps sys_unlink fires.  Definitions and small structural lemmas only --
   no bundle, no arms, no frame, no [Module Type].  sys_unlink's ONE
   contract is [SpecSysUnlink]'s [SYSUNLINK], which requires this file and
   states its bundle and arms over these pieces.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 1, 4
   and 7 ("ONE CONTRACT PER SYSCALL").  The abstract vocabulary is FsAbs.v;
   this file is at the family's accumulated form:

     - the walk premise is the ERA/relative-start shape
       ([FsAbsEraMknod.npar_walk_pre_era], consumed from
       [FsAbsStart.ep_start]: one-shot, ∀ pl r, with only the
       SLASH -> ROOTINO tie), REUSED VERBATIM -- it is the nameiparent
       family's, shared by mknod, create, open-with-O_CREATE, unlink,
       mkdir and link;
     - the commits are RAW-MAP ([_at]) shaped ([FsAbsMknodFire]'s finding:
       [astate]-shaped success commits cannot pay [ftop_body]'s give-back;
       no [astate] twins exist here to weaken to -- [dlookup_commit_at]'s
       one read-only weakening is that file's and is not repeated).

   ==== WHO ELSE TAKES THESE PIECES ====================================

   The pieces here are shared vocabulary, which is why they live below the
   contract rather than inside it:

   - [utgt_commit_at]: SpecSysLink.v, ProofSysLink.v, ProofSysLinkTails.v,
     FsAbsLinkFire.v -- sys_link's target leg is the SAME commit, at the
     failure arm where the linked target's count comes back down.
   - [uent_commit_at] / [dmiss_commit_at]: FsAbsUnlinkFire.v (the fire
     lemmas) and FsAbsInvFire.v (the trivial-family dischargers).
   - [unl_pre] and its row algebra: FsAbsUnlinkFire.v, FsAbsLinkFire.v.

   ==== THE DELTA IS TWO INSTANTS, AND THAT IS A MACHINE FACT ==========

   Doc section 4's [δ_unlink] is fused: delete the name, target.nlink-1,
   dir arm also parent.nlink-1.  The fused delta is stated below
   ([delta_unlink], total, side conditions in [unl_pre]) -- but IT IS NOT
   REALIZABLE AT ONE COMMIT, and the walk is the evidence.  Its success
   arms fire TWO [InodeRegion.ireg_top_retag_*] steps:

     instant 1 -- THE PARENT ROW: at the zeroing ([memset]+[writei] of
        the found record; W5-FILE), or fused with the [dp->nlink--;
        iupdate(dp)] pair on the DIR arm (W5-DIR retags [dp] ONCE, after
        iupdate, covering entry-delete and count together -- legal
        because dp's lock is held across both writes).  The reading is
        [delta_unl_ent]: [dir_entries] of the flushed record is
        [delete nm] of the old one ([FsStateEra.dir_entries_unlink_eq]),
        count down [unl_dec] on the dir arm.
     instant 2 -- THE TARGET ROW: after [ip->nlink--; iupdate(ip)],
        i.e. AFTER [iunlockput(dp)] released the parent.  The reading is
        [delta_unl_tgt]: same node, count down one.

   Between the two, [ftopN] must close and reopen (real instructions run,
   other harts' movers need the invariant), so the authority PASSES
   THROUGH the intermediate state -- entry gone, target count not yet
   down -- and a concurrent observer may see it.  Neither a single
   two-row commit nor mknod's collapse trick is available: mknod's fused
   delta collapsed to ONE row because the child's row was pre-observed
   ([insert_id]); here BOTH rows genuinely move.  So the bundle carries
   TWO commits, [uent_commit_at] and [utgt_commit_at], each in
   [FsAbsMknodFire.acre_commit_at]'s two-phase mold at its own instant.

   WHAT MAKES THE PAIR READ LIKE ONE DELTA ANYWAY: [ip]'s lock is taken
   at W3, BEFORE instant 1, and held through instant 2 -- the target's
   fragment is in the walk's custody the whole way, so its row cannot
   move between the instants.  The ret-0 arm states that pin purely
   ([av1 !! t = Some a], the row [unl_pre] observed at instant 1), and
   [delta_unlink_split] is the machine-checked composition: under
   [unl_pre] the fused delta IS [delta_unl_tgt ∘ delta_unl_ent].  A
   quiescent consumer (the tree layer, holding exclusivity) reads the
   pair as one [delta_unlink]; a concurrent one gets the honest two
   steps.  This mirrors the doc's own precedent for link ("two
   linearization instants") and write (per-chunk deltas).

   ==== THE SIDE CONDITIONS, AND THE TWO KERNEL READINGS ===============

   [unl_pre] is what the kernel has established at instant 1, restated
   abstractly: the parent is a directory whose map carries [nm ↦ t]; the
   name is NEITHER dot ([FsTree.DOT]/[DOTDOT] -- the entry-map spelling
   of the two [namecmp] guards; the landed contract's own vocabulary for
   these names is [dir_bname], whose values these are); the parent's
   count is live ([1 <= nl] -- the walk's home-live fact, from
   [DirView.dir_orphan_clean]: a dir holding a live non-dot record
   cannot be orphaned); the target's row is [a] with [1 <= an_nlink a]
   (the kernel's [ip->nlink < 1] panic guard, walked at W3); and a
   DIRECTORY target's entry map is dots-only ([dots_only] -- THE
   ISDIREMPTY READING: the loop found every record at index >= 2 free,
   records 0 and 1 ARE the dots ([DirView.dir_dots_ix]), so first-match
   [dir_entries] holds no other name).  [unl_pre_ne] derives [d <> t]
   from these -- a dir target's dots-only map cannot carry the non-dot
   [nm] its self-row would need.

   ==== NOTHING ABOUT DURABILITY, AND NOTHING ABOUT [δ_free] ===========

   No durable clause appears below (doc section 5: three global principles
   at crash points; the per-syscall durable content is
   [FsDurSyscall.unlink_durable] and [unlink_durable_freed], composed by
   the consumer through [flushed]/[dur_at]).

   And nothing about [δ_free] -- THE VIEW IS THE LIVE NAMESPACE (owner
   ruling Q-d), so there is nothing left for it to do.  A successful
   unlink of a target with prior nlink 1 takes the row OUT of the view at
   instant 2 ([delta_unl_tgt] deletes at count 0): an unlinked-but-open
   file is the fd-holders' private buffer, not part of the file system a
   user can name, and [iput]'s eventual free of the record moves nothing
   the view has ([FsAbsDefs.abs_of] is [None] on both sides).  Two honest
   notes on that boundary:
     - what an fd-holder still reads of the unlinked file is the fd row's
       business (fs-syscall-specs section 4's stable corollary at the
       client's own share), not the file system's;
     - [delta_unlink_last_file] / [delta_unlink_last_dir] and
       [delta_unlink_is_Some_other] state the rows; the record's dots
       survive underneath, unnamed.

   ==== THE MISS COMMIT ================================================

   [dmiss_commit_at] is new in [dlookup_commit_at]'s single-phase mold:
   mknod's miss was its success path; unlink's is a failure the kernel
   OBSERVED, so it gets a fired receipt.  [Ftgt]'s receipt is binary
   ([aview -> Z -> iProp]) because instant 2 has no name in hand (the
   name buffer is dead by then) and no parent.

   BINDERS: [SysMknodDefs]'s section list verbatim -- [fileG] is bound
   and [icacheG]/[icfg] resolve only through its fields; the FsAbs
   carriers resolve [fsTopG]/[fsLinkG] through [xv6G]'s fields.  The
   live Γ is [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L fsc_fs] ([FsAbs.ftop_gamma_top]
   ties its gname to [ftop_body]'s authority by reflexivity).  [FsImg]
   is neither Required nor Imported here (the walk premise carries
   [FsImg.ROOTINO] inside the reused definition). *)

(* ============================================================================
   OPTION A (reordered iput) -- the OFF-LOCK DEPOSIT accessor (iput +0xb6).
   A leaf above EscrowInode/InodeRegion: it opens [ireg_inv], absorbs the
   freer's fragment, DEPOSITS the region marker into the 0x86-minted escrow
   ([escA_deposit] -> [committedA]), rebinds+splits the marked slot's [reg_full]
   (structural since the reg-fold), and parks the region PENDING arm.  It is
   THE region's type-0 write -- the only one the reordered kernel has -- with
   the deposit as its closing action, and it lives here and not in
   [InodeRegion] because the escrow has to be open beside the region.  In its own file
   so the fs-cone imports it needs ([DiskPtsto]/[LogInv]/[FsBlocks]/[DinodeEnc])
   do not disturb [EscrowInode]'s escrow proofs (import-order/instance hygiene,
   as in the EscrowRegionA de-risk).

   ---- WHAT IT RETIRES, AND THE ONE THING IT DOES NOT (increment IVa) ------

   Since iclaim-ledger.md §1.4 this accessor also RETIRES THE FREEZE: it takes
   the [FrzPost] token the walk carries from iput+0x8a and steps the column to
   [FrzOff] in the same region open that absorbs [dinode_at] and fills the
   escrow.  It has to take a TOKEN and not a premise -- see the note at the
   premise itself.

   §3.12's RULING A″ additionally asks the retire to hand back a SOLE-HOLDER
   WITNESS, parked by [InodeRegion.ireg_freeze_au] at the mint, so that a
   foreign idup's up-count can refute a standing [FrzPre] by fraction
   collision.  THAT WITNESS IS NOT HERE, and iclaim-ledger.md §3.13 records
   why it cannot be: every resource that collides with a foreign holder's
   supply is keyed by the itable SLOT [k] ([live_frac], [iref_frag],
   [slh_tok (icfg_isl k)], the [ientry k] cells), while [ireg_slot] -- the
   freeze arm -- is keyed by the INUM.  A parked [∃ k0, W k0] and a caller's
   slice at [k] compose to a perfectly valid element of the same map, so there
   is no validity goal to close.  The collision itself is right and already
   proven ([IcacheInv.live_whole_share_absurd]); only its home is open.

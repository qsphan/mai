     EAGER (t == SBRK_EAGER, or n < 0)  growproc ran -- a grow MAPS the run

        fails exactly when its scan finds no null slot, and [filedup] never
        fails.  So a dup that returned -1 did so because

          - THE ARGUMENT IS NOT AN OPEN DESCRIPTOR of the caller.  Stated
            at a [nat] index rather than on [usys_argfd] directly, for the
            same reason close's row is: [Z.to_nat] of a NEGATIVE argument
            is 0, and dup(-1) must not be licensed to say anything about
            slot 0.  An out-of-range index leaves the premise vacuous,
            which is right -- that is a failure the caller reads off the
            number alone and needs no table for;
          - ...OR THE TABLE IS FULL: the scan found no closed slot at all,
            which is [fd_lowest_closed] answering [None].

        WHY THE FAILURE ARM AND NOT THE SUCCESS ARM.  The success arm is
        left exactly as it was; what a caller needs to pin its descriptors
        is the ability to REFUTE -1, and that is this arm's business.

        -- read at the state list through
        [ProcInv.proc_priv_states_agree].

        which refutes both disjuncts, so neither of its two dups can fail

(* ...and the table is blind to the EPC WORD too, for the reason
   [usys_num_epc] is: the words it reads are 14, 15, 16 and 21, and the epc
   is 3.  This is what lets the trap loop state the round at the trapframe
   the process TRAPPED with, while the dispatcher's own row is stated at the
   one usertrap's [p->trapframe->epc += 4] block handed on.  ([tf_ueq]
   cannot do this job: the epc is exactly the word the two lists differ
   in.) *)

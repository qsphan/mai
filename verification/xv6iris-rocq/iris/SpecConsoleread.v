   @ KernelSyms.consoleread = 0x80000178, 89 instructions / 274 bytes; a
   96-byte frame with ra/s0/s1/s2/s3/s4/s6/s7 saved in the prologue and s5 --
   the byte just read -- SHRINK-WRAPPED onto the paths that have one.

   THE SHAPE IS PIPEREAD'S, and not by imitation: the two are the same animal,
   a blocking read into USER memory by the running thread, under a spinlock
   that a wakeup-issuing interrupt handler also takes.  Conjunct for conjunct,
   [SpecPiperead.v] with the pipe replaced by the console:

   * [ConsoleInv.is_conslock γc] is THE WHOLE CREDENTIAL -- one persistent
     proposition, no reference, no fraction.  [cons] is a static global, so
     unlike a pipe's page it is never freed and its lock is not cancellable;
     what the lock protects is [ConsoleInv.cons_res], the 128-byte ring and
     the three index words, and nothing of it comes back out to a caller;
   * it SLEEPS, so it threads the running-thread bundle ([procs_inv]) and
     takes the hart-generic parking premise [eb = true] at [noff = 0] --
     cons.lock is the only lock it holds and sleep demands that.  The parked
     scheduler record is NOT threaded: it lives in the running proc's own
     [p->lock] ([SchedCtx.run_slot]), which sleep reaches by holding it.  The
     condition lock is dropped and re-taken by consoleread ITSELF, through
     the ordinary RELEASE / ACQUIRE contracts (SpecSleep.v's split protocol);
   * it copies out, so it takes [proc_priv_core] and [kalloc_env]
     (either_copyout reaches copyout, hence vmfault, hence kalloc) and gives
     the block back at an EXTENDED page table ([uptd_ext]), exactly as
     readi's user arm does;
   * it gives back every callee-saved register and the nesting level.

   ---- WHAT IT PROMISES ABOUT THE OUTPUT -------------------------------

   THE RETURN VALUE RANGE, [-1 <= r <= n].  The [-1] is real here (unlike
   consolewrite's): a process killed while it waits gets it.  ([Z.max 0 n]
   rather than [n] so the statement is true at a non-positive request too,
   where the loop never runs and the answer is 0.)  It is what
   [SpecFileread.fileread_ret] consumes.

   ...AND THE LEDGER: the [d] bytes the call copied out are [d] bytes the
   UART really delivered, in copy order, each with the application's
   persistent claim about the history it arrived at.
   [ConsoleInv.cons_tagged bs hs d] is the tie -- [hs !! j] ends in an
   [ObsUartIn Uart0 b] whose [ConsoleInv.cons_xlate b] IS the [j]th byte of the
   run -- and [[∗ list] h ∈ hs, riscv_rx_tag h] is the claim.  It comes
   out of the ring's coupling (ConsoleInv.v's header): the loop pops at
   [cons.r] while [cons.r != cons.w], so every byte it copies is inside
   the live range the row speaks for.  The tags are PERSISTENT, so this
   costs the ring nothing.

   THE -1 ARM IS NOT AN EXCEPTION.  A process killed mid-loop has already
   copied earlier rounds' bytes, and those bytes were tagged; the ledger
   is stated at the same [d] on every arm, so a caller need not case on
   the answer to read it.

   WHAT IS STILL NOT PROMISED is a LINE DISCIPLINE -- that what was typed
   is what is read, in the order it was typed.  The ledger says each byte
   delivered arrived at a history that ends in it; it does not order the
   histories, and it does not say the ring was not edited (C('U') and
   backspace drop bytes that were tagged).  What the read syscall's
   console receipt carries to the process is exactly this
   ([SpecFileread.console_receipt]). *)

         the console without the token is paid for with
         [ConsoleInv.cons_dirty_cred], which is PERSISTENT
         ([ConsoleInv.cons_acc]'s second disjunct, and the generic slot's
         supply law is the reason it has to be), so arbitrarily many
         processes can be inside consoleread at once.  A reader that pops
         while this call sleeps moves the ring's committed count without
         moving the cursor, so this call's bytes are no longer consecutive
         and its own advance is no longer [d] or [d+1].  What that reader
         DOES leave behind is the ring's marker, and the marker is the
         credential: so contiguity is promised exactly where the position
         is, and the right arm hands back the credential that sends the
         caller's continuation generic instead.

         [cons_stored_lb] and [cons_tagged] STAY UNCONDITIONAL: a bound on
         the committed sequence and the per-byte tags hold on every arm --
         every byte delivered really did arrive at its history -- and it is

     system built at exactly that [D'].  So this lemma read after a commit
     says: what the machine would recover to is the file system the batch

  (* ---- (7b) THE COMMIT POINT, AT THE LOGGED VIEW (durable-disk 1b).
     The new committed view is a TERM the caller can read -- and the term is
     [L] on the home set, NOT install arithmetic: the install is the log's
     own business and stays inside this lemma ([fs_install_is_logged]).
     THERE IS NO CLIENT PURE PREMISE.  What used to be [fs_commit_pres] --
     "the state this write jumps to is still a well-formed file system",
     quantified over a picture no caller of end_op could name -- is gone;
     what replaces it is the log's own two rows, both of which the committer
     proves for itself:

       [Htie]  row (b) at the commit ([LogInv.log_mirror_tie_body], read
               through [Hoff] at the caller's off-header view [V]), and
       [Hslot] the entries' slot contents, i.e. the copy loop's ghost step
               composed with the chained slot picture.

     The premises about the picture are stated at [V], the caller's
     OFF-HEADER view, because both landing orders reach this shift and only
     one of them has already moved the header row: a statement mentioning
     [lm_view M0] at the header could not serve both branches with ONE
     receipt. ---- *)

    (* THE SNAPSHOT'S PREMISE (lane CE, plan section 3's "Commit"; moved to
       a RESOURCE by durable-disk lane H2).  The one thing the new durable
       epoch needs, and the ONLY new premise the commit takes: THE EPOCH
       ITSELF, at the view this write jumps to.  It is what
       [LogSnapLaw.snap_law] hands down at the quiescent era, and the
       committer reads it off [LogInv.log_ctx_snap_law_of_ops] BEFORE it
       releases the log lock -- which is where the transaction authority the
       law needs lives.  It used to be the PURE [∃ S, snap_ok S L], with the
       WAL's permit ALLOCATING the file system's snapshot from a value it
       cannot check; now the file system builds its own epoch at its own
       ghost step and this permit only swaps the registry over
       ([FsDurSnap.dsnap_step_merge]).  Nothing is taken OUT of the crash
       predicate, so plan section 8's refutation still does not bite.
       ...AND THE GUEST'S MERGE BESIDE IT (round C; SY3-K2): the law built
       the PAIR, and this is the one permit that moves the guest -- the old
       one goes to the pair's merge ([FsDurSnap.dur_merge]), which yields
       the new one at the new map name; the old snapshot is dropped.
       ...AND THE APPLICATION'S TOKEN [T] COMES BACK OUT OF THE MERGE (sync
       K3-3) and leaves in the permit's residual, beside the receipt: it
       rides the write's receipt to the commit's tail, which re-deposits
       it in the log invariant. *)

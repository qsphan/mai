       that is what it is handed back as. *)

    (* THE OLD-SHAPE HANDLER, out of the PAIRED one: the safety theorem
       below takes [▷ stvec_handler_wp], i.e. "hand me a trap frame and I
       run forever", and what this slot was given is "hand me a trap frame
       AND the next WP".  The missing half is [IH], which lives under the
       same later -- so one [iNext] strips both and the two compose. *)

       [va' = va] by construction), the mstatus pins come straight from the
       slot's own premise, and the pinned image [M] is forgotten -- which is
       precisely the information a GENERIC inhabitant may throw away and a

(* SpecHolding.v -- the public interface of Holding, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof
   file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   holding(lk) reads BOTH of the lock's words, and both belong to the lock
   invariant (WpLock.v), so the caller passes no [lk->cpu] cell.  Two forms,
   and BOTH give a definite answer:

     - with this hart's HELD-SET AUTHORITY and [s ∉ lks], the answer is
       provably 0.  The held state of the invariant keeps [lk_in i s] beside
       the owner word, so a hart whose set omits [s] is not the holder [i],
       and [lk->cpu] is therefore some other hart's [struct cpu] (or 0).
       That is acquire's check, and it is why acquire's
       [if(holding(lk)) panic("acquire")] arm is DEAD CODE -- no panic
       credential absorbs it, nothing reaches it.
     - with the [locked] holder token, the answer is provably 1 (the token
       pins [lk->cpu] at this hart's [struct cpu]); the token comes back out.
       That is release's check.

   THE EVIDENCE-FREE FORM IS GONE.  It concluded [a0 = 0 ∨ a0 = 1] -- all a
   caller with no evidence at all can know -- and its only client was
   acquire, which had to close the 1 arm with the placeholder panic credential.
   Since the held-set authority is already inside acquire's [cpu_own], the
   evidence costs the call site nothing and the arm goes away instead.

   Both are stated over [lock_openable] (WpLock.v) rather than [is_lock], so
   they work for a lock whose storage can be reclaimed.  What each open
   presents is a credential that refutes the dead state [Dc]: for the
   evidence-free form that is the caller's own [Tc] (a reference to the
   object), and for the [locked] form it is the holder token itself -- which
   is all a caller has left once the object's last reference has gone home.
   holding() never disposes of anything, so [Dc] only rides along; a static
   kernel lock takes [Dc := False] and [lock_refute_False]. *)

(* INTERRUPTS MUST BE DISABLED at holding() -- it [jal mycpu]s at +0x16, and
   [mycpu]'s own contract (SpecMycpu.v) is stated at the LITERAL [b = false]
   (its [tp] read happens mid-body, so a [b]-generic caller could not even
   supply a matching [sie_cap_gpr _ _ b] to it).  Stating this contract at
   [false] directly -- with no [wp_next] wrapper at all, since it collapses
   by [wp_next_off] anyway -- is sound: holding() is only ever called from
   acquire()/release(), both of which have already called push_off().  It
   also makes the holder token's hart identity track a SINGLE ambient [CID]
   throughout the body (no migrated-hart mismatch can arise at the +0x12
   [lk->cpu] read below). *)

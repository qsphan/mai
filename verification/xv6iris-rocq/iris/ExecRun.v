  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* WHAT THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY CARRIES.  [UkRun.urun] binds the image, the
     permission map, the break, the descriptor view, the generation, the
     children set and the pid under its own existential, so a lemma stated
     where the program is cannot name any of them: what it can carry is the
     bundle AT EVERY such key, with the two authorities LENT so that the
     facts about the key -- the path string in the caller's own rodata, its
     argv node, the length of its descriptor list -- can be read off them
     (UkRun.v's note at [udepw_at]).  That loan is the whole reason this
     shape exists and is not a bare conjunction.

     [cs] and [pidv] are bound and NOT lent here: a supplier that reads
     neither states its entry at the bound pair, which is what "the identity
     rows are the caller's knowledge" means for a program that has none.
     One that DOES read them takes [uexec_sup_run_ids] below.

     [pv] and [av] -- the path pointer and the argument vector -- are
     PARAMETERS rather than [m !!! a0] / [m !!! a1]: a supplier knows the
     two addresses it put there (they are its own rodata's and its own
     node's), and the rule takes the two equations against the register
     file.  That is design/user-exec.md section 2's own [m[a0] = pv] line,
     and it is what keeps [Regidx] out of a program's supply lemma. *)

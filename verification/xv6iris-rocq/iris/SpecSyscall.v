(* SpecSyscall.v -- the public interface of syscall() (syscall.c), stated
   ahead of its proof.  THIS CONTRACT IS ASSUMED: LinkSyscall.v supplies it
   with an [Axiom], the way LinkPrintk.v and LinkConsoleintr.v do for
   their functions.  It exists so usertrap can be proved against a stated
   interface rather than against nothing.

     void syscall(void) {
       struct proc *p = myproc();
       int num = p->trapframe->a7;
       if (num > 0 && num < NELEM(syscalls) && syscalls[num]) {
         p->trapframe->a0 = syscalls[num]();
       } else {
         printk("%d %s: unknown sys call %d\n", p->pid, p->name, num);
         p->trapframe->a0 = -1;
       }
     }

   @ KernelSyms.syscall = 0x80002872, 100 bytes / 33 instructions, a 32-byte
   ra/s0/s1/s2 frame.

   WHAT MAKES THIS ONE HARD TO STATE HONESTLY, and how the statement below
   handles it: syscall is an INDIRECT CALL through [syscalls[]], so its
   footprint is the UNION of all twenty-two sys_* functions' -- the file
   table, the buffer cache, the log, the inode cache, kalloc, the wait lock,
   the initproc cell, the fd and iref allowances.  Spelling that union out
   here would be to restate SpecSysExit.v's thirty parameters and then some,
   and every one of them would have to be threaded verbatim through
   usertrap's own contract for no gain: usertrap does not touch any of it,
   it only hands it over.

   MOST of that union is therefore still ONE ABSTRACT PARAMETER,
   [syscall_env γf pj], exactly as [SpecUsertrap.v]'s original boundary
   statement abstracted its kernel-internal resources: consumers thread it
   opaquely, and [ProofSyscall.v] defines it (as the union of whatever is
   NOT listed below, indexed by the ghost names the table's entries want)
   without churning usertrap's own proof.

   FOUR FAMILIES ARE PULLED OUT AS EXPLICIT PARAMETERS INSTEAD, and this is
   not an inconsistency with the paragraph above -- it is forced by a
   SHARING constraint [syscall_env] cannot express on its own.
   [UsertrapRes.ut_own] already threads [bslots]/the [initproc]
   cell/[fd_slots]/[iref_slots] to fund usertrap's OWN direct [kexit]
   calls on the killed-before/killed-after arms (both of which run OUTSIDE
   this call, never through [syscall_env]).  [SpecSysExit.v]'s own
   contract needs exactly the same four families for the SAME physical
   pool, reached only when the dispatch table selects [SYS_exit] -- so if
   [syscall_env] carried an independent copy of any of them, [ut_res]'s
   existential would be asking for TWO disjoint fundings of one pool, which
   no boot-time construction could discharge (durable-notes.md's "two
   owners of one address space" trap, in ghost-resource form: `own γ (◯ n)
   ∗ own γ (◯ n)` is not [False], but it silently doubles the authority a
   real allocation would have to supply).  So these four ride through
   [syscall()] itself on the SAME channel [ut_own] already uses for them,
   in and out, exactly like [proc_priv] -- not through [syscall_env].
   Everything else in the union genuinely has no competing outer copy
   ([UsertrapRes.v] never mentions the icache/inode-region invariants, the
   superblock cells, or the bitmap invariant at all), so it stays inside the
   still-abstract [syscall_env] -- but [syscall_env] is ALSO INDEXED BY
   [bn]/[fn], not just [γf]/[pj], for a second reason discovered writing
   [ProofSyscall.v]: eight entries (exit, pipe, close, chdir, mknod, link,
   mkdir, exec) need filesystem-fabric facts -- [bio_ctx], the kmem/itable
   locks, the icache invariants -- keyed to the SAME [bn]/[fn] the four
   explicit families above already carry.  Without the extra indices,
   [syscall_env]'s own internal existential witnesses for those facts could
   never be shown equal to the AMBIENT [bn]/[fn] a caller already fixed --
   not a competing-owner problem this time, but an unreachable-witness one,
   and the fix is the same shape: widen the index rather than smuggle the
   fact through an unrelated channel. [UsertrapRes.ut_own]'s own [Rsys]
   slot widened to match (`Rsys (un_f N) (un_pj N) (un_bn N) (un_fn N)`),
   which every one of its ~25 mentions in that file threads opaquely --
   NOTHING in [ProofUsertrapSys.v]'s call site needed to change, since it
   never applies [Rsys]/[syscall_env] itself, only names the resource
   `Rsys ...` produces.

   What the contract does say concretely is the part usertrap actually depends on:

     - the process block goes in and comes back, at a MOVED record [V'] --
       every syscall may write [p->trapframe->a0] (the return value), and
       sbrk/exec/chdir/open move [pv_sz] / [pv_upt] / [pv_cwd] / [pv_ofile]
       besides.  The one thing pinned is [ud_tfp]: the trapframe PAGE never
       changes (even exec, which builds a whole new table, maps the existing
       [p->trapframe]), and prepare_return's stores land there;
     - callee-saved registers are preserved and the pc returns to ra;
     - the crossing is REAL ([wp_next]): sys_wait / sys_pause / sys_read
       park, so syscall can return on a different hart;
     - and syscall MIGHT NOT RETURN AT ALL, without the contract having to
       say when.  [sys_exit] parks the thread as a ZOMBIE, and which entry
       runs is the syscall number, decided inside the dispatch -- so the exit
       slot is an ADDITIVE CONJUNCTION of the return continuation and a
       [ProcDefs.kstack_closer], and the callee picks.  The note at the slot
       itself is the argument for why [∧] is the only one of the three
       connectives that can be paid here.

   THE INDEX IS PINNED AT [true], AND UNLIKE prepare_return'S THAT IS NOT A
   GAP.  syscall has exactly one call site -- usertrap's [jal syscall] --
   and the instruction immediately before it is [csrsi sstatus,2], xv6's
   [intr_on()].  The sys_* cone below needs it: everything that sleeps
   ([SpecSleep]) or parks ([SpecKexit]) demands [eb = true], and at push_off
   level 0 the base-enable and the live index coincide
   ([CpuOwn.cpu_own_eb_agree]).  So the pinned index states a property of the
   only reachable configuration, rather than excluding one.                 *)

(* The dispatch hands back a fresh [U'] and, until this predicate, said
   nothing whatever about the image inside it.  That is the [proc_pt_any]
   smell one tier up -- a contract that cannot say what happened to the
   process state -- and at THIS altitude the answer is a function of the
   syscall NUMBER, which the ENTRY state already determines.

   [sysc_num V] is the number the dispatch itself reads: [p->trapframe->a7],
   trapframe word 21 = [tf_arg_idx 7], as a SIGNED 32-bit value because the C
   reads it into an [int] and tests [num > 0 && num < NELEM(syscalls)].  The
   [ld a5,168(s2)] at +0x16 and the [addiw a3,a5,0] at +0x1a are where that
   reading comes from.

   THE FOUR ENTRIES THAT WRITE USER MEMORY GET A ROW EACH, SPELLED OUT.
   There used to be a [sysc_window] table naming only WHICH ARGUMENT the
   write is based at, with the length left entirely existential -- which
   made the row nearly vacuous: a caller passing a null pointer to [wait]
   learned only that the kernel had written SOME run from address 0
   upward, which is enough to clobber the caller's own text.  Each entry
   now says how far the write can reach, which is what every one of the
   four callee contracts already proved and this table discarded
   ([SpecKwait]'s [d <= 4], [SpecSysPipe]'s [d <= 8], [SpecFilestat]'s
   [d <= 24], [SpecSysRead]'s [d <= max 0 count]).

   WHAT STAYS EXISTENTIAL IS THE LENGTH WITHIN THAT BOUND AND THE BYTES,
   NEVER AN IMAGE.  A caller learns that nothing outside the run
   [arg .. arg+d) moved, which is what it can act on
   ([UserPtTree.umem_wr_lookup_out]); which bytes landed there is the
   ENTRY's own contract to say, and the console and pipe arms cannot say
   it at all.

   TWO ENTRIES MOVE THE ADDRESS SPACE ITSELF and a window is the wrong
   shape for them.  [sbrk] gets [sysc_sbrk_ok] below -- a FUNCTION of the
   entry and exit sizes, saying which way the address space went and how
   far, descriptor included; [exec] replaces the address space outright and
   is unconstrained here, its image being [KexecDefs]'s to pin. *)

(* THE DESCRIPTOR TABLE'S ROWS, beside the image's.  [sysc_mem_ok] above
   says what syscall() does to the process's memory; this says what it does

   TWO PREDICATES RATHER THAN ONE, for the reason the two halves of the
   round are separate everywhere else on this path: a syscall proof
   discharges them against different resources -- the page table and the
   image on one side, [FdSlots.fd_frags] and the ofile array on the other --
   so a single conjunction would force every entry's proof to have both in
   hand at once.  They are stated adjacently so that "what this entry
   moves" is still one thing to read.

   per-incarnation GHOST NAME; the states under it are what

     TABLE ENTRY NOT RETURN WITHOUT THE CONTRACT SAYING WHICH ONE.

     Twenty-one entries return; [sys_exit] parks the thread as a ZOMBIE and
     never does.  The choice is made INSIDE the dispatch (it is the table
     index), so both outcomes have to be available at entry -- and the two
     are funded by the SAME resources, namely the caller's own frame cells,
     since only one of them ever happens.  That is exactly what [∧] means in
     a separation logic and what neither of its neighbours can say:

       [∗] would make the caller supply both AT ONCE, out of disjoint
           resources -- usertrap cannot, its frame cells are needed by each;
       [∨] would make the CALLER pick -- usertrap cannot, it does not know
           the syscall number;
       [∧] makes the caller prove EACH from its full context and lets the
           CALLEE pick, which is the real control flow.

     So syscall() never has to expose whether it returns.  What is proved is
     only the conditional: IF an entry declines to return, THEN it can
     reclaim the kernel stack.  A returning arm takes the left conjunct and
     is written exactly as it was before this slot changed.

     The right conjunct is anchored at syscall's OWN entry sp with depth
     [trap_res true + av], which is the anchor and depth [SpecSysExit] wants
     one frame further down: an arm walks it there with
     [ProcDefs.kstack_closer_frame] over syscall's own four slots.  It costs
     the caller nothing it did not already have -- usertrap is entered with
     sp AT THE PAGE TOP, where [ProcDefs.kstack_closer_top] mints a closer
     out of the PERSISTENT [is_kstack] alone -- which is why this change

         (i)  THE TRAPFRAME WORDS.  Literal equality is FALSE -- the return
              value IS written into the a0 slot, by the [sd a0,112(s2)] at
              [syscall + 0x3a], i.e. AFTER the dispatch returns -- so what

              ecall arm forall-binds the return value and the caller
              instantiates it at whatever was stored.
         (ii) THE PAGE-TABLE DESCRIPTOR.  Literal equality is FALSE on the
              eleven buffer-touching entries -- a copyin/copyout lazy fault
              grows [ud_um] -- so what holds is [ProcPtOwn.uptd_ext_sz] at
              the process's OWN SIZE: same root, same trapframe page, a user
              map that only gained entries, each of them BELOW [p->sz] and
              carrying vmfault's own RW-user bits.  The size and the bits
              are what [UserPerm.perm_of_uptd_ext_sz] needs to see that the
              PERMISSION PROJECTION does not move under a lazy fill, which
              is the [pi' = pi] the user-execution round
              ([UexecRound.uround_ok]) is stated with -- a bare [uptd_ext]
              cannot get there ([upt_acc_wf] permits R+X user leaves, and
              text pages genuinely are R+X below [p->sz]).  Every producer
              has it: copyin / copyout / copyinstr return it and the whole
              chain between them and this post now relays it.

  (* the kernel-side resources the syscall table's entries consume, for the
     process at [pj] whose open-file table is named by [γf].  Defined
     concretely by the (future) proof; threaded opaquely by usertrap.

     HART-FREE, AND THAT IS PART OF THE CONTRACT rather than an accident of
     the binder list.  The environment is FRAMED across steps that run at
     [b = true] -- syscall's own tail after a parking table entry returns, and
     usertrap's whole tail on this arm ([jal killed], [jal prepare_return]) --
     and at that index a step may resume on a DIFFERENT hart.  A hart-indexed
     resource cannot cross: [IntrDefs.trap_csrs_ext_transport] and its
     siblings work only because their propositions are [emp] at [true], and
     nothing of that kind is available for an abstract family.  So the union
     of the twenty-two entries' footprints has to be hart-free, which it is:
     locks, invariants, ghost fragments and memory points-to, no per-hart
     register cell and no [tick_hart].  (Compare [SpecDevintr.devintr_caps],
     which genuinely is per-hart -- [TimerCap.timer_cap] holds this hart's
     mcounteren/stimecmp -- and which usertrap therefore carries in the
     hart-generic [UsertrapRes.devintr_caps_any] form instead.) *)

  (* THE ENVIRONMENT'S PRODUCER -- the one thing about [syscall_env] that   *)

  (* [LinkSyscall.v] has said all along that establishing the environment is
     the boot chain's job and is still owed: the dispatch is LINKED, all
     twenty-two arms, no axiom, but nothing anywhere BUILDS a
     [syscall_env].  It only ever arrives abstractly, as usertrap's [Rsys].
     That is fine for a process already in the trap loop and impossible for
     a process being put INTO it, which is why parking a fresh process has
     been assumed since kfork was written.

     THIS IS THAT PRODUCER, and its premise list is the point.  Everything
     the environment needs about the FILE SYSTEM comes from [first_done]
     ([first_addr |->4[] 0 and FsReady.fs_ready]) -- including the
     environment's own fourth conjunct, which IS [first_done].  What is left
     is four persistent rows the file system does not carry
     ([SyscParkEnv.v] names them) and four the caller is holding anyway for
     [UsertrapRes.ut_caps] (the [wait_lock], [is_ftable], [procs_inv],
     [disk_geom]).  Nothing here is exclusive and nothing here is boot
     state.

     WHY [first_done] AND NOT [fs_ready]: the environment's fourth conjunct
     is the steady arm of proc.c's [static int first], whose discarded cell
     is written by exactly one instruction in the kernel -- the release
     store on forkret's boot arm.  A producer given only [fs_ready] would
     be short a row that userinit, which parks the very process that runs
     that store, could not possibly supply.  See SpecForkret.v's last
     header section for the whole ordering argument.

     THE INDICES ARE READ OFF [fn] rather than taken as parameters, because
     [sysc_proc_ties] pins them: [pj] must be [proc_addr (fcn_j fn)].  The
     three pure premises below ARE that record, which since rank 1d is the
     PROCESS half and nothing else. *)

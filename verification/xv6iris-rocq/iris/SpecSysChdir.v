       struct proc *p = myproc();

   @ KernelSyms.sys_chdir, 128 bytes / 45 instructions (CodeSysChdir.v).
   A TWENTY-slot frame: ra@152, s0@144 (the frame pointer), s1@136 (the
   inode, saved only on the path that has one) and s2@128 (the proc), with
   the low sixteen slots -- sp+0 .. sp+127 -- being the [char path[128]]
   local.  [addi a1,s0,-160] / [addi a0,s0,-160] are that buffer's address.

   ==== WHAT THIS CONTRACT IS ABOUT =====================================

   sys_chdir is the SECOND writer of [p->cwd] (kexit is the first), and the
   only one that installs a reference rather than retiring one.  The whole
   contract is the accounting of that swap, and [ProcInv.proc_priv_cwd_pid]
   is the accessor it was written for: the cell and the pid quarter come out
   TOGETHER, because begin_op / namei / ilock / iput / end_op each want
   [p_pid pj |->4{dq} _] while the cwd cell has to stay out from the
   [ld a0,336(s2)] that reads the pointer iput destroys to the
   [sd s1,336(s2)] that installs the new one.

   THE REFERENCE LEDGER CLOSES AT TWO ON EVERY ARM, which is why
   [iref_slots 2] goes in and comes back out unchanged:

   * namei takes two units (its walk holds at most two references at once)
     and, on success, hands back ONE -- the second is spent against the
     reference it returns;
   * the success arm's [iput(p->cwd)] destroys the OLD working directory and
     frees that unit, so the process still owns exactly one parked unit, now
     against [ip];
   * the not-a-directory arm's [iunlockput(ip)] destroys the reference namei
     just made and frees ITS unit, and [p->cwd] never moved;
   * the two failure arms of the [||] never made a reference at all.

   So on all four arms the caller gets [iref_slots 2] back, and the
   invariant "a live process's [p->cwd] has one unit parked in the itable"
   is preserved rather than merely restored.

   ==== THE LOG LEDGER IS THE SET FORM, AND IT HAS TO BE ================

   begin_op mints [LogInv.log_op g MAXOPBLOCKS] = ten units, and end_op
   retires whatever is left, so nothing log-shaped crosses this interface.
   What DOES matter is that the ten units cover the whole body, and the
   COUNTED namei contract does not deliver that: its premise is
   [(L + 1) * iput_units <= n] and its spend is the same figure, so at a
   three-component path it would demand twelve of the ten, and even at
   L = 2 it would hand back one where the following [iput] needs three.
   The SET form -- [SpecNameiEra.wp_namei_era], the era trace walk this
   contract's proof runs, over [LogInv.log_opSt] -- prices the walk at
   [SpecNamex.walk_need L <= 4] regardless of depth and spends at most
   one, which leaves nine for an [iput] that needs three.  That is the
   whole reason this proof threads [log_opS] rather than [log_op]: chdir is
   the first syscall whose path length is unbounded and whose tail still
   has to pay for an inode free.

   NO LINK RESOURCE APPEARS HERE (design/fs-icache.md 20.18 ruling 1).
   sys_chdir writes no directory record -- it reads a type field and swaps a
   pointer -- so there is no count to move and no [IcacheEscrow.dlinks]
   obligation to carry.

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   [eb = true] is namei's premise, inherited verbatim: the walker runs with
   the interrupt base enabled, and every acquire inside it mints its own
   pay.  The [trap_csrs_ext] / [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded
   anyway, uniformly with begin_op / iput / end_op, and is [emp] there.

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function sleeps in five of its
   callees, so it may return on a hart other than the one it was called on.

   DETERMINISM: none is claimed, and none is available.  Which of the four
   arms runs is a function of the FILE SYSTEM -- whether the user string
   faults, whether the path resolves, whether what it resolves to is a
   directory -- and no caller of this contract knows any of that.  The
   postcondition is therefore the honest disjunction [SpecNamei]'s own
   two-armed result forces, keyed by the returned a0.

   ==== ONE CONTRACT ====================================================

   [Module Type SYSCHDIR] is sys_chdir's only seal.  Its body is the
   whole-function FRAME below plus ONE caller INPUT ([chdir_au_pre]) and
   ONE armed OUTPUT ([chdir_arms], keyed on a0).  The blanket
   [sys_chdir_post] is a CONSEQUENCE of the arms ([chdir_arms_landed])
   rather than a second conjunct -- it carries [proc_priv], which every
   arm already carries -- and it survives as the shape the friendly
   packaging above this contract states ([FsSyscalls] section 4, whose
   functor calls this seal at the trivial families and converts through
   that one bridge).

   ==== WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IN, AND WHAT IT BUYS =====================

   [chdir_au_pre] is the walk-only bundle at the commit mask [appE]:
   [SysOpenDefs.namei_walk_pre_era] handed down unfired, plus
   [SysOpenDefs.aopen_commit_at], open's plain read-only observation,
   fired under the node's lock exactly where the walk tests [T_DIR].
   sys_chdir MINTS NO VOCABULARY OF ITS OWN: every piece it names is the
   open family's, which is why the pieces live in [SysOpenDefs] and only
   the bundle, the arms and the frame live here.

   What it buys is the inum.  A blanket-only success arm is
   [∃ ipv z, proc_priv .. (us_cwi (us_cwd U ipv) z)]: [z] is the real inum
   of the installed inode, but nothing above the icache could say WHICH
   inode that was.  Here [z] IS the walk's cursor, so a caller that
   supplied a cursor it understands learns where its cwd went.

   THE START: the walk premise is [namei_walk_pre_era] at
   [pv_cwi (us_V U)], the calling process's cwd inum at entry, so a
   relative chdir's walk starts where the block says it does.

   ==== THE ARMS ========================================================

   ret 0  -- [chdir_post_ok]: the walk landed on a DIRECTORY, observed as
             such, and the block's cwd moved to it -- pointer and inum
             both, the inum being the walk's own cursor [i].
   ret -1 -- [chdir_post_fail], the three-way fold with the block back
             unchanged on every arm:
             (i)   nothing fs-visible happened (argstr failed): the whole
                   bundle comes back;
             (ii)  the walk died: [namei_walk_dead_era]'s refund shape
                   beside the unfired commit;
             (iii) the walk landed and the node was OBSERVED to be
                   something other than a directory -- the cursor [P L i]
                   and the receipt [Fo.(pf_recv) av i a] at that node.

  (* THE PROCESS-NAMEABLE HALF OF THE ARMS: chdir's RECEIPT.  What the arms
     above give the DISPATCHER is [proc_priv] at the block whose cwd moved;
     what they give the PROCESS is this -- the walk cursor, the observed
     directory row and the observation's receipt, read at the working
     directory the call resumes at.  It names no kernel ghost: no
     [proc_priv], no [pv_cwd] pointer, no [ProcInv] record at all, which is
     what makes it statable at the U-mode key ([UexecSG.spost_at], branch 9)
     where the only thing the process holds about its cwd is [cw'].

     THE TWO ARMS ARE THE ARMS', keyed on the same a0: a failed chdir
     resumes at the directory it came in with and hands the whole bundle
     back ([chdir_post_fail]); a successful one resumes at the inum the walk
     reached, which is the receipt's whole content -- [cw' = i] is what
     SHARPENS [UsysMemOk.usys_cwd_ok]'s chdir row (which says only that a
     FAILED chdir does not move) into "the directory you named is the

     says which; the process gets the receipt, read at the inum the block
     now carries.  The arms are not weakened: everything they hold appears
     on the right of this wand.

     THE PREMISE IS THE CONTRACT'S OWN INSTANTIATION.  [chdir_arms] takes
     [cw] and [U] independently and relates them nowhere, so its failure arm
     cannot say by itself that the call resumes at [cw]; [wp_sys_chdir_body]

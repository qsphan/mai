(* SpecWriteHead.v -- the public interface of write_head, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     static void write_head(void) {
       struct buf *buf = bread(log.dev, log.start);
       struct logheader *hb = (struct logheader * ) buf->data;
       hb->n = log.lh.n;
       for (int i = 0; i < log.lh.n; i++) hb->block[i] = log.lh.block[i];
       bwrite(buf);
       brelse(buf);
     }

   THE COMMITTER-ONLY HELPER.  write_head is [static]; its only callers are
   end_op (via the inlined commit) and initlog (via the inlined
   recover_from_log), and BOTH of them are holding the checked-out
   [log_state] when they call it -- the "log" spinlock is NOT held (the C
   code runs commit with no locks, which is the whole point of the
   committing flag).  So this contract does NOT take [log_res]; it takes,
   EXPLICITLY, exactly the pieces of the batch write_head touches:

     - the header cells it READS: lh.n at [lh_n_pa] and lh.block[i] at
       [lh_block i] for i < n = length W.  Both come back UNCHANGED --
       write_head only copies the in-memory header OUT to the buffer.
     - the logged-view AUTHORITY [ghost_map_auth_frac (fs_cache γfs) 1 L].  This is
       the freeze-by-auth: while the committer holds it nobody else can
       move L, and write_head needs it because it rewrites the header
       BLOCK's logical content.
     - the header block's own client half [fs_chalf γfs (log_hdr_bno
       logstart) bsh] -- the log is its own client for the header and the
       LOGBLOCKS slots.  It comes back at the new content [bs'], with the
       authority updated at that one key.
     - one [bslot] for its bread, returned by its brelse.

   WHAT THE POST SAYS ABOUT THE NEW HEADER.  Two facts, and the second one
   is what makes the commit fupd possible: [hdr_n bs' = n] -- the header's
   first little-endian 32-bit word, i.e. the [int n] field (LogInv.hdr_n) --
   and the FULL on-disk encoding [hdr_dec bs' = (n, map uint W)]
   (FsCrash.hdr_dec), i.e. that the copy loop really did lay W out as the
   following little-endian words.  The first is what initlog's clean-image
   path needs (it re-reads the header it just wrote, and its precondition is
   that n = 0 there); the second is what identifies the durable state this
   write commits to ([FsCrash.fs_commit_L_seq_permit] decodes the header
   it is handed), so when n > 0 this bwrite is THE COMMIT POINT
   (D := L over W).

   write_head sleeps (bread, bwrite, brelse), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does, plus the disk
   fabric; it enters and returns at noff 0. *)

     the header block lands one 512-byte sector at a time and the caller owes
     one chained view shift per landing -- which is exactly where "the commit

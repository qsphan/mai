(* HartSpan.v -- THE SPAN RULE, the B′ keystone (design doc §5 item 1c).

   A batched stretch (HartLift) requires every touched register in an
   exclusively-owned footprint.  A real cycle's prelude reads ~54 registers
   that are NOT ownable and whose values are irrelevant (the pmpaddr file
   with every PMP entry OFF, mie/mideleg/mip/sig_meip/sig_seip under
   MIE=0).  The span rule covers such stretches:

     - WRITES are gated on the caller's exclusive footprint [Drw]
       (frame + ghost updates, exactly as the batch rule);
     - READS ARE UNGATED -- the machine answers them from its own file;
     - a read-only, dfrac-generic frame [Dro] pins the value-SENSITIVE
       reads (the config bundle) and is exported as an agreement fact;
     - the continuation is quantified over the RELATIONAL landing set:
       an rtc of span steps in which, BETWEEN nodes, every register
       outside [Drw ∪ Dro] may be perturbed arbitrarily.  That is the
       honest in-WP knowledge: the ghost cells pin exactly the framed
       registers; the semantic licence (RiscvLang.prim_step_hart_regs_frame
       -- only the plic's sig_seip write is cross-thread) pins more, but
       is not derivable from inside a WP proof.

   The landing quantifier is killed by a ONCE-PER-CLASS pure
   characterization lemma: with the [Dro] values pinned, every span chain
   from the class's monad is forced to the same landing, because each
   unowned read feeds a value-insensitive continuation (checked by cbn --
   the mechanism the symbolic-stretch probe validated).  Spans are CHOPPED
   at invariant-cell writes (minstret_increment / minstret / the tick's
   clock cells), each a single-node HartRegNode rule.

   The rule is proven by STRUCTURAL INDUCTION ON THE MONAD -- each step's
   continuation is an immediate subterm -- via the [Acc] fixpoint
   [mchild_wf]; no Löb, no fuel. *)

       Per step: [wp_hart_step]; the callback's σ gives the machine file;
       [hreg_frame_agree]/[hreg_frame_ro_agree] pin agreement on Drw/Dro;
       the node's head is [m]'s (concrete constructor —
       [hspan_stops Drw m = false] says it is a span class):
       - RegRead r: the machine's successor is [K (register_lookup r
         σ.(sregs))]; the witness and inversion are the deterministic
         RegRead arm of [mnode_step].  The span witness for the recursion:
         one [hspani] step whose [rs1] is σ's file (which agrees with the
         TRACKED [rs] on Drw ∪ Dro by the frames -- that is exactly
         [hspani]'s ∃rs1).
       - RegWrite r (r ∈ Drw by...): CAREFUL -- [hspan_stops m = false]
         gives [r ∈ Drw] via bool_decide; the frame updates as in
         [HartLift.wp_hsil_node]'s RegWrite case ([hreg_frame_update]);
         the ro-frame is untouched ([Drw ## Dro] keeps its lookups stable
         under [register_set r] via [irrelevant_register_set]).
       - silent-class nodes: state unchanged, frames re-anchored by
         [hreg_frame_ext] (lookups unchanged).
       After the step, the successor monad is a subterm ([hspan_node_mchild])
       -- if [hspan_stops Drw m' = true], fire the continuation with the
       one-step-chain witness; otherwise recurse by the induction
       hypothesis, PREPENDING the step to the recursive landing's chain
       (rtc_l), and re-anchoring both frames at the post file.
       The ▷-bookkeeping: the first machine step strips the continuation's
       ▷; recursive invocations pass it un-▷'d (the IH's continuation
       premise is under ▷ -- introduce it with [iNext] absorbed by the
       step's own later, exactly as [wp_hsil_rtc] does).
       CHAIN COMPOSITION CARE: the landing fact's start file [rs0] is the
       FIRST step's machine file; the recursive call's fact starts at the
       post-step file -- compose with [rtc_l] and transport the agreement
       ([reg_agree_on] is preserved by the step on Drw ∪ Dro: reads change
       nothing, Drw writes move both [rs] and the machine file in

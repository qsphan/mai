(* SpecForkretParkPaid.v -- forkret_park, stated at the premises a caller
   must PAY.  The park turns a freshly-allocated process's raw saved context
   (ra = forkret, sp = kstack + PGSIZE, twelve don't-care callee-saved slots)
   into a member of the scheduler's swtch chain, [SchedCtx.proc_ctx] -- so
   that kfork and userinit can release the process at RUNNABLE.

   [SpecForkretPark.FORKRET_PARK] is the same park ASSUMED, in the form the
   two callers use today; this file is what a proof of it is stated against.
   The difference between the two is exactly the bundle below, and that
   difference -- not anything about forkret -- is what keeps the axiom alive.

   HISTORY, because this file was deleted and rewritten.  An earlier version
   (last green at 4bbc418f) was a functor over [FORKRET_NF]: forkret's
   contract MINUS a [first] premise, assumed in [LinkForkretNF.v].  Forkret
   is now PROVED outright -- boot arm, kexec, panic tail and all
   (ProofForkret.fkr_boot) -- and its contract has moved with it, so that
   whole scaffold is gone: no [FORKRET_NF], no [LinkForkretNF.v], no
   [Pfirst], no [pt] parameter, no [is_lock γl p s Rlk] triple.  A park
   proved against THIS statement is functor over [SpecForkret.FORKRET] and
   is instantiated with [LinkForkret.Forkret], so its cone carries no
   first-related axiom at all.

   WHAT MOVED, ITEM BY ITEM, relative to that earlier statement:

     - THE [first] PREMISE IS GONE and nothing replaces it here.  The branch
       is decided by [FirstTok]'s arms, which the block premise below
       carries and this contract passes through untouched.  A STEADY caller
       owes a [proc_priv] whose token is the steady arm, and
       [FirstTok.first_done] is persistent and is already the last conjunct
       of [ProofSyscall.syscall_env], which the closer needs anyway; a BOOT
       caller owes the block minus its token, the cwd reference and
       [FirstTok.first_boot], which is the mode itself as a resource.

     - THE DESCRIPTOR IS NOT PINNED.  forkret's residue closer is now
       [∀ pt'], because the boot arm's kexec REPLACES the address space:
       the table userret runs on is not the one forkret was entered with, so
       no [pt] fixed on entry can name both.  The closer below is quantified
       the same way and is handed the two page-table facts rather than
       taking them as premises of the park.  Consequently [V] left
       [forkret_park_pkg]'s signature entirely -- it occurred only inside
       [pv_upt V].

     - THE DEPTH PREMISE IS GONE, not merely restated.  It used to read
       [6 + trap_res true + K_prepare_return <= av]; forkret's deepest
       callee is now kexec's, so the obligation is [K_kexec <= av2] at
       [av2 = av - 6 - trap_res eb'].  With [K_kexec = 188],
       [trap_res true = kv_frame_slots = 90] and [K_usertrap = 346], that is
       [284 <= av] -- implied by the [K_usertrap <= av] this file already
       carries, so it is [lia]'s job and not a caller's.

Module Type FORKRET_PARK_PAID.
  (* the residue is the module-type parameter it is everywhere else *)
  (* ...AND THE PARK'S ONE PRODUCER-SIDE ENTRY, threaded with the rest.
     [UtResFits.USERTRAP_RES_PARK] is [USERTRAP_RES] plus
     [usertrap_res_bare_park]: the residue stays opaque to every CONSUMER,
     and the one party that has to BUILD one -- whoever parks a process that
     has never trapped -- gets a closer instead.  See that file's "THE
     PARK'S CHANNEL THROUGH THE MODULE TYPES". *)

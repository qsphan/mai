   172 bytes.  Geometry VERIFIED off CodeDirlookup.v, not off fs.c:
   [addi sp,sp,-96] / [addi s0,sp,96], so [&de = s0-96] ([addi s4,s0,-96] at
   +0x2a) and [&de.name = s0-94] ([addi s6,s0,-94] at +0x30); the record
   stride 16 is [li s3,16] at +0x2e, which feeds readi's [n] AND the
   [addiw s1,s1,16] at +0x52; the free test is the ZERO-EXTENDING
   [lhu a5,-96(s0)] at +0x6e, so it is the halfword and not a byte; the
   size is RE-READ every iteration ([lw a5,76(s2)] at +0x54) and compared
   [bgeu s1,a5]; and the iget arguments are [lw a0,0(s2)] (dp->dev,
   SIGN-extended) and [lhu a1,-96(s0)] (the inum, ZERO-extended).

   ---- WHAT IT SPEAKS IN ------------------------------------------------

   [DirView.v]'s record view over [InodeInv.file_byte data]: [dir_inum],
   [dir_name], [dir_live], [dir_match] and the first-match search
   [dir_first].  [nrec] is [dir_nrec (di_size dn)] = size/16, the number of
   WHOLE records; when the size is NOT a multiple of 16 the loop takes one
   turn past [nrec] and dies in panic("dirlookup read") -- see below.

   ---- THE THREE PREMISES A CALLER MUST BRING ---------------------------

   (1) [di_type dn = T_DIR].  Refutes panic("dirlookup not DIR") at +0x1c;
       namex tests exactly this before calling.

   (2) readi's own threading: [bm_covers], the MAXFILE*BSIZE size bound,
       [log_geom_ok] / [blkmap_wf].  Note that readi's JOINT NUMERIC
       premise is NOT a caller premise here: [off + 16 <= size <=
       MAXFILE*BSIZE] discharges it at every call.

   (3) [DirView.dir_inums_ok] -- EVERY LIVE RECORD'S INUM IS INSIDE THE
       INODE REGION.  iget's one argument premise is [bv_unsigned inum <
       16 * nib], and dirlookup's inum comes off the DISK, so nothing in
       the proof can establish it: it is a well-formedness fact about the
       directory's contents and it must be a premise.  It is quantified
       over the records because the matching record is not known until the
       loop stops.

       WHERE A CALLER GETS IT (fs-icache.md §15(a)): it is now a SYSTEM
       INVARIANT, the conjunct [DirView.dir_ok icfg_nib dn data] riding in
       [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded] and in [ipool_shape_np]'s allocated arm, so
       namex destructs it out of ilock's postcondition at a directory it
       could not have named in advance -- [DirView.dir_ok_dir] is the one
       step, and it is at [icfg_nib] outright since rank 1c.

   ---- THE GRANULARITY PREMISE IS GONE (fs-icache.md §15(b)) -----------

   [16 | di_size dn] USED to be premise (2), and under it every loop readi
   had [off + 16 <= size], [rd_clamp] was 16, and panic("dirlookup read")
   at +0x46 was dead.  It is NOT an invariant: THIS kernel's balloc returns
   0 when the disk is full (stock xv6 panics -- see SpecBalloc.v's header),
   so dirlink's third arm really does append a PREFIX of a 16-byte record
   and leaves [size = 16*nrec + tot] permanently non-granular.  The next
   scan of such a directory takes ONE extra turn of the loop, at
   [i = nrec] with [16*nrec < size], whose readi returns [tot < 16] and
   whose [bne a0,s3] at +0x6a is TAKEN -- into panic("dirlookup read").
   That arm is now LIVE and discharged against [SpecPanic].  No
   postcondition arm is added: panic never returns, so the found/notfound
   arms carry an implicit "...and every readi in the scan returned 16",
   which is what the old premise gave and what the panic arm gives without
   it.  A caller -- namex included -- needs no granularity fact at all.

   ---- THE TWO ARMS ----------------------------------------------------

   FOUND:  [dir_first data nrec s = Some k]; a0 is iget's entry pointer and
   the caller gets iget's [inode_ref] at the 32-bit widening of that
   record's inum; [*poff = 16k] on the non-null arm.

   NOT FOUND: [dir_first data nrec s = None]; a0 = 0; the [iref_slot] the
   caller brought for iget comes BACK (iget is only reached on the found
   arm), and [*poff] is untouched.

   The directory bundle -- [i_dev], [inode_meta], [inode_map],
   [inode_blocks] -- comes back LITERALLY unchanged on both arms: readi
   modifies nothing and iget touches only icache state.

   ---- THE BORROWED LICENCE (increment C'-lite, fs-fragments.md §7.1) ----

   dirlookup is where the kernel turns a NAME into an inum and hands that
   inum to [iget], so it is where §20.17.5's enumeration has to be paid for.
   [SpecIget] now demands an [IgetLic.iname] and dirlookup's proof produces
   one at the matched record -- out of the directory's own ticket list, which
   this contract therefore BORROWS.

   THREE THINGS COME IN AND GO BACK OUT VERBATIM, ON BOTH ARMS (R13(ii)):

   [IcacheEscrow.dlinks fsc_fs (bv_unsigned dinum) dn bm data] -- the home's
   name-keyed entry fragments ([FsStateInode.ent_toks_x]), over the
   PRE-state (there is no post-state: dirlookup writes nothing).  At the
   matched name it is the payment unit that founds licence (a).  Nothing is
   spent: the fragment is lent to [iget] and handed straight back, which is why the borrow costs the six call sites nothing but a
   [iFrame] -- every one of them holds it already, out of
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded].

   [dinode_at fsc_ireg dinum dr] -- the HOME's own record, which is licence (c) at
   the SELF record.  A lookup of ["."] returns the inum of the very
   directory the caller has locked, and the self record carries no fragment
   of ANOTHER inum's register (the source comment is "No ip->nlink++ for
   '.': avoid cyclic ref count") -- so the entry fragments do not found that
   iget and the home's own record must.  This is why the
   contract gains an inum parameter [dinum] it never reads.  The record is a
   SEPARATE binder [dr] rather than the in-core [dn], because dirlink's inner
   lookup holds the region's own (possibly stale) copy [dn0] and not the
   in-core one -- and licence (c) needs nothing about the record beyond a
   nonzero type, which is premise (6).

   THE PURE PREMISE IS A DISJUNCTION, AND THAT IS FORCED (§7.5.6).  The
   matched record's fragment is a witness only under a LIVE home -- an
   orphan's dot records are tokenless ([FsStateInode.ent_tokenless]) and
   under [dir_orphan_clean] it has no other live record -- and a bare "the
   home's count is nonzero"
   premise is UNSUPPLIABLE at sys_unlink, which does nameiparent, ilock(dp),
   dirlookup(dp,name,&off) with no [dp->nlink == 0] re-check anywhere.  The
   right disjunct is what sys_unlink brings instead: its two [namecmp]
   refusals at sysfile.c:220-221 mean the name it is looking up is neither
   ["."] nor [".."], and under [dir_orphan_clean] an ORPHANED directory's
   live records are all dot records -- so the matched record is not live,
   the found arm is vacuous, and the fragment is only ever cashed under a live
   home.  [dl_lic_live] below is that argument in five lines; the supplier
   table is §7.5.6's.

   [dir_orphan_clean dn data] rides beside it because it is what makes the
   right disjunct close, and it costs nothing: it is already a conjunct of
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded], landed, and every caller destructs it out of
   ilock's postcondition already.

   dirlookup SLEEPS (readi does), so it threads the full running-process
   bundle and takes the parking premise.  It enters and returns at noff 0. *)

(* ====================================================================== *)

(* The premise below is a disjunction because of who can SUPPLY it (§7.5.6);
   what the PROOF needs is the left half, and this is the one step between
   them.  At a hit the matched record is live and its canonical name is the
   [s] the caller asked for; if the home were orphaned, [dir_orphan_clean]
   would make that name one of the two dots, which the right disjunct
   refuses.  So a hit under either disjunct is a hit under a live home --
   and the found arm is where the whole borrow is cashed.

     (RULING D), landed in its EQUATIONAL form; the deviation is recorded
     below and it is a strict WEAKENING of the ruling's text, not of what
     the proof needs.

     WHY THE PROOF NEEDS SOMETHING: licence (c) was strengthened by §2.6
     ([IgetLic.iname]'s [HeldL d] now carries [di_nlink d <> 0], because the
     freeze pin's [di_nlink = 0] is what the row contradicts), so
     [iname_held_intro] at the ["."] site (ProofDirlookup.v:2076) asks for
     the borrowed REGION record's count as well as its type.

     WHY NOT THE RULING'S [bv_unsigned (di_nlink dr) <> 0]: dirlookup has
     FIVE callers, not the four §3.3 enumerates, and the fifth --
     [FsLookup.wp_dirlookup_tree] -- provably cannot pay it.  FsLookup's own
     header says so in as many words ("[node_rep] ... says NOTHING about
     [di_nlink].  There is no tree-level fact that implies it"), which is
     why ITS premise (4) is the §7.5.6 DISJUNCTION and nothing stronger.
     Under the ruling's shape the tree layer would go red with no discharge
     in sight -- §3.3's TRIPWIRE t3b territory.

     WHY THE EQUATION COSTS NOTHING INSTEAD: the proof site already holds
     [Hnl0 : bv_unsigned (di_nlink dn) <> 0] about the IN-CORE record -- it
     is [dl_lic_live]'s output, derived on the hit arm from premises (4) and
     (5) before the self/non-self split -- so the count it is missing is
     only the region record's, and this equation transports the one it has.
     FOUR of the five callers hand the SAME record in twice ([dn dn]:
     FsLookup, ProofCreate, ProofNamex, ProofSysUnlinkPure) and pay [eq_refl];
     the fifth (ProofDirlink, the one caller with a genuinely stale region
     index) pays it out of [di_nlink_stable]'s first conjunct, which its
     contract already carries for [SpecIupdate]'s sake.  It is the same
     "parked-means-flushed" fact [ic_loaded] states resource-side, at one

(* SpecVirtioDiskInit.v -- the public interface of VirtioDiskInit, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

   [virtio_disk_init] (kernel/virtio_disk.c) brings the virtio-mmio block
   device up.

   What it does, in order:
     initlock(&disk.vdisk_lock, "virtio_disk")
     read + check MAGIC / VERSION / DEVICE_ID / VENDOR_ID
     STATUS <- 0                        (reset)
     STATUS <- ACKNOWLEDGE, then | DRIVER
     read DEVICE_FEATURES, mask, write DRIVER_FEATURES
     STATUS <- | FEATURES_OK, re-read STATUS and check the bit stuck
     QUEUE_SEL <- 0; check QUEUE_READY is clear; check QUEUE_NUM_MAX >= NUM
     kalloc() x3 for the descriptor table, available ring and used ring,
       memset each to zero
     QUEUE_NUM <- 8; the three ring addresses as low/high halves
     QUEUE_READY <- 1; disk.free[0..7] <- 1; STATUS <- | DRIVER_OK

   EVERY panic path is refuted rather than assumed, so this spec needs no
   panic credential at all (all six are refuted):
     - the four identification reads are constants of the model
       ([virtio_ident_reads], [virtio_queue_num_max_read]);
     - FEATURES_OK sticks because the write took ([virtio_status_readback]);
     - QUEUE_READY reads clear because the reset cleared it
       ([virtio_reset_not_ready]);
     - QUEUE_NUM_MAX = 1024, so neither the "no queue 0" nor the "max queue too
       short" test fires;
     - kalloc cannot return null, because the caller supplies three pages.

   STATED OVER THE TIME-0 DEVICE INVARIANT.  Device init does NOT run before the
   device invariant exists: the disk thread must REFUTE [DevStepDiskWild] at
   every step, and only [virtio_proto] can do that, so [virtio_frag] can never
   sit raw in a CPU's precondition while the system runs.  The contract
   therefore takes [WpUart.disk_inv] and borrows the fragment around each MMIO
   access.  Two things make that work:

     - THE CONFIG TRACKER.  [virtio_proto]'s not-live arm holds HALF of the
       config cell at [v_cfg v] (VirtioProto.v); the caller holds the other
       half, [disk_cfg_is γv (DfracOwn (1/2)) c0], and hence knows
       deterministically which configuration the function has programmed so far
       even though the state itself lives under an invariant.  The device never
       writes [v_cfg] ([virtio_complete_cfg]), so the pair is stable across
       device steps.  [⌜virtio_live c0 = false⌝] is what says the invariant is
       in its not-live arm at entry -- which the reset (STATUS <- 0) would
       re-establish anyway, but which the FIRST reads need before the reset.

     - THE LIVE FLIP.  [virtio_live] needs QUEUE_READY and DRIVER_OK, so the
       arm flips at the LAST MMIO write of the function (STATUS |= DRIVER_OK).
       That write is therefore where the DMA lease is paid in -- inside this
       function rather than at the caller ([VirtioProto.virtio_proto_intro] is
       the transition) -- and the retired config halves are consumed by the
       freeze that mints the persistent [disk_cfg].

   THE POSTCONDITION consequently hands back no device fragment at all.  What
   it hands back instead is what a driver needs and can only get here: the
   publisher token [disk_pub γv 0] -- which is ALSO the witness that the queue
   is live, since [virtio_proto]'s not-live arm holds the [dn_np] ghost_var_frac at
   the FULL fraction and every [virtio_proto_*_acc] refutes that arm from the
   caller's half -- and the frozen [disk_cfg γv (virtio_init_cfg pd pav pu)]
   that [DiskInv.disk_geom] is built from.

   Two page conjuncts shrank, because the lease is paid from them: the used
   page goes to the device whole, and so do the two bytes of the available
   ring's index field, AND its eight ring cells (finding 5 -- the device
   invariant owns them now).  What comes back of the available page is
   [seq 20 4076],
   i.e. from the ring entries on -- the two flags bytes below the index are
   forfeited too rather than handed back in two pieces, since no consumer has
   ever wanted them.  The descriptor page comes back whole (it is driver-owned
   throughout: it becomes [DiskInv.free_slot_res]).

   -- which, written out, is twenty wands over three [seq 0 4096] big-ops.

(* WpIntrOff.v -- intr_off() at push_off level 0, FROM EITHER INDEX.

   xv6's [intr_off()] is one instruction, [csrci sstatus,2], and until now
   the tier had a leaf for it only at the ENABLED index:
   [WpSconfCsr.wp_csrci_sstatus_x0_s_sconf] is the real '1' -> '0' flip and
   REFUTES its [b = false] arm outright (its [intr_count_pre b 0 true]
   premise is unsatisfiable there -- the count eighth at '1' contradicts the
   capability's '0' eighth).  So a caller that reaches an [intr_off()] with
   interrupts ALREADY off had no leaf at all.

   THAT CALLER IS prepare_return, AND THROUGH IT usertrap.  usertrap enters
   from uservec with SIE = 0 and enables interrupts only on the SYSCALL path
   ([csrsi sstatus,2] just before the [jal syscall]); the devintr, vmfault
   and unexpected-scause paths all reach [prepare_return] still disabled.
   A contract for prepare_return pinned at [b = true] therefore covers only
   one of usertrap's four routes into it.

   THE COMPOSITE BELOW IS WHAT MAKES THE CONTRACT INDEX-GENERIC, and it is
   stated over [CpuOwn.cpu_own] rather than over the leaf's raw pieces
   because that is what makes its POSTCONDITION index-free: whichever arm the
   caller came in on, it leaves holding [cpu_own 0 false p C false] and
   [trap_csrs], so the code after the [csrci] is proved ONCE.  The two arms
   differ only in where those come from:

     b = true   the flip is real.  [sie_arm true p] is dismantled and pays
                out the trap CSRs, the per-cpu cells, the counting token at
                [sie_bit false], and the reserve [trap_res true] -- so
                [trap_csrs_ext true = emp]: the caller brings nothing.
     b = false  the write clears a bit that is already clear
                ([wp_csrci_sstatus_x0_idem_s_sconf]).  Nothing moves and
                nothing is paid out, so the caller brings the trap CSRs
                itself ([trap_csrs_ext false = trap_csrs]) and keeps its own
                cells; [trap_res false = 0], so the index does not move
                either.

   [trap_csrs_ext] is exactly the complement [IntrDefs] already defines for
   this seam ("what a caller has to BRING because the bundle does not already
   own it"), which is what SpecYield/SpecSched use to park at [eb = false];
   this file is the same accounting one instruction lower down.               *)

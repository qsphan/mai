   @ KernelSyms.iget, 170 bytes: a 64-byte frame around one acquire, a
   do-while scan of the fifty entries, and TWO exits that each release and
   return the entry -- the cache HIT (+0x56/+0x58, [ref++]) and the RECYCLE
   (+0x6e/+0x72/+0x78/+0x7c, the four identity/ref/valid stores).  The scan
   is the loop [IcacheRefDefs.ientry_step] and [ientry_sentinel] describe: the
   cursor steps by [ISLOTSZ] and stops at [KernelSyms.log], which IS
   [ientry NINODE].

   ---- WHAT IT TAKES, AND WHY THERE IS NO REFERENCE AMONG IT -------------

   iget is the function that MINTS references, so unlike idup / ilock /
   iput it takes none.  What it takes instead is:

   [is_itable2] -- the itable spinlock over the v2 resource.  Everything
   iget touches beyond the [ref] words lives there: the identity cells
   (through [islot2]), the pure slot->inum map [ci] and the uncached POOL.

   [itable_inv] -- where the [ref] WORDS live (design §4).  The scan's
   [c.lw a5,8(s1)] at +0x44 reads one per iteration and the two writes
   (+0x58 and +0x78) open it; holding the lock's half of the authority
   across each read-modify-write is what makes it atomic in the proof.

   [ic_escrows] -- EVERY entry's escrow, not one.  ilock and iunlock are
   handed the slot they are to work on and name its escrow; iget's scan
   walks all fifty and cannot know in advance which it will stop at, so its
   contract takes the whole persistent family.

   ONE [iref_slot], and it is spent on BOTH arms.  The hit arm's [ref++] is
   an unconditional increment and cannot re-establish "the count is still an
   int" on its own ([IrefSlots.v]'s header); the recycle arm's [ref = 1]
   parks the unit that accounts for the reference it mints.  Exactly
   filedup's and idup's discipline: it is the caller's job to bring one.

   NO reference.  [ireg_inv] IS taken, and the "no [ireg_inv]" clause this
   paragraph used to carry is AMENDED (iclaim-ledger.md §3.3's contract-set
   widening, executed in increment IIIe): iget still never READS a dinode
   -- the region open is GHOST-ONLY, on the ledger's [icnt] and freeze
   columns and nothing else.  Two sites need it and both are on the recycle
   arm:

     - the pool peel ([IcacheEscrow.ipool_shape_to_np]) opens the region to
       refute the AWAIT arm's standing freeze from the caller's LICENCE
       (§3.1's A-refuter: the old [ipool_await_refuter] wand into [False] is
       unbuildable out of a fupd, so the refutation moved INSIDE the peel's
       own fupd, where it needs [ireg_inv] and the [iname] this contract
       already takes);
     - the 0 -> 1 count move ([IcacheInv.iref_alloc_store_au]) has to carry
       the peeled [icnt_half] from 0 to 1, and the region owns the other
       half of that column.

   The inum's pool bundle still moves through the recycle arm as an opaque
   the pool row ([IcacheEscrow], §13.3) -- extracted from the pool and
   parked in the entry's escrow for whoever ilocks it next -- and iget never
   looks inside it.  The bundle's payload is untouched here; only its two
   ghost columns move.

   ---- THE ONE PREMISE A READER SHOULD LOOK AT TWICE --------------------

   [bv_unsigned inum < 16 * Z.of_nat nib] is the only constraint on the
   arguments, and it is NOT about the scan: it is what puts the requested
   inum in [IcacheEscrow.region_inums], which is what lets the recycle arm
   take its bundle out of the pool ([ipool_acc]).  The scan's own loop
   invariant -- no slot in the range already scanned carries (dev, inum) --
   is what shows the inum is not among the CACHED ones, and the two together
   are the pool membership fact.

   ...EXCEPT THAT THE SCAN'S INVARIANT IS PAIR-SHAPED AND THE POOL IS NOT
   (§13.11).  xv6's hit test is [ip->dev == dev && ip->inum == inum], and
   the dev compare at +0x4c short-circuits to the loop step BEFORE
   [ip->inum] is ever loaded, so a scan that misses proves only that no live
   slot carries THE PAIR -- while the pool, the region and [dinode_at] are
   keyed on the inum ALONE (one file system).  A live slot at (dev', inum)
   would leave the recycle with no bundle to withdraw, a second [dinode_at]
   for one inum against [InodeRegion.dinode_at_excl], and [ci]-injectivity
   broken.  The two readings coincide exactly when the cache holds ONE
   device, which is now said out loud: [is_itable2] carries the table's
   device and is instantiated HERE at iget's own [dev].  So there is still
   no separate premise on [dev] -- the argument simply IS the table's
   device, the way [dev] is [BioInv.bv_dev V] on the buffer side -- and iget
   writes it into the recycled entry as before, with only ilock's later
   bread caring what it means.

   ---- THE POSTCONDITION IS UNIFORM ACROSS THE TWO ARMS -----------------

   [∃ k q, a0 = ientry k ∧ k < NINODE, and ONE reference to slot k at the
   caller's dev and inum].  A hit mints [q] out of the share the table
   retained ([IcacheInv.iref_incr_store_au], §13.1b -- the incrementer holds
   no token of its own, so [iref_dup_step]'s split cannot serve); a recycle
   mints the first reference of a fresh entry ([iref_alloc_step] at a
   fraction at most 1/2, because the escrow owns the other half of both
   identity cells forever, §13.1e).  Which of the two happened is invisible
   to the caller, and must be: xv6's whole point is that a second [iget] of
   a cached inode is indistinguishable from the first.

   Note the WIDTHS.  The reference is at the 32-bit [dev] / [inum] the
   identity cells hold; the returned register carries the 64-bit entry
   ADDRESS, and [IcacheRefDefs.ientry_inj] is what makes the two views the same
   thing.  The arguments arrive sign-extended, which is forced by the code:
   the scan's compares at +0x4c / +0x52 are 64-bit [bne]s against registers
   holding the [c.lw] of a cell.

   ---- THE "iget: no inodes" PANIC IS LIVE ------------------------------

   The second panic arm in this tree to be taken rather than refuted
   ([SpecIlock.v]'s "ilock: no type" is the first, and its header explains
   the pattern).  A full table is a real state -- fifty entries all with
   [ref > 0] and none of them this inode -- and no premise a caller could
   state would rule it out, because whether the table is full is a fact
   about every OTHER process's open files.  So on that arm iget diverges
   through [SpecPanic]'s own contract and this postcondition speaks only for
   the calls that return.  That is sound in a partial-correctness WP and it
   is the honest statement; the proof file says at which instruction (+0x6a,
   [beq s3,zero]) it is taken.

   ---- THE SIE BOOKKEEPING ----------------------------------------------

   [SpecIdup.v]'s, for the same reason and with the same derivation: iget
   takes no sleeplock and never sleeps, its whole body runs inside one
   fully-nested acquire/release, and [n], [eb] and the SIE index [b]
   therefore come back exactly as they went in.  It is NOT the
   running-process bundle ilock threads -- nothing here can park.

   ---- THE LICENCE (increment C'-lite, fs-fragments.md §7.1) ------------

   iget is where a REFERENCE is minted for an inum that came off a disk
   block, and nothing in the scan can say the inum names a live inode.
   §20.17.5 answered that with a paragraph -- the enumeration of the six
   reasons a caller believes its inum -- and [IgetLic.v] makes it a type:
   one binder [l : ilic] and one premise [iname fsc_ireg fsc_fs inodestart inum l].  The user's
   invariant ("the kernel will never invoke iget on inode numbers in
   directories in a disconnected subtree") is not statable about the
   machine's traces; it IS statable here, at DELIVERY, and that is why the
   enumeration lives on THIS contract and not on a payload.

   BORROWED AND RETURNED, AT THE SAME [l] (§7.1.2).  The licence comes back
   in the postcondition, unspent and at the SAME constructor.  Both halves
   are load-bearing.  Returning it is what keeps this increment
   caller-side: the borrow lives inside one call, so no syscall-level
   contract sees it and [SpecNamex] / [SpecCreate] / [SpecSysLink] /
   [SpecIalloc] / [SpecIlock] / [SpecIput] / [SpecIupdate] are all
   byte-identical.  Returning it at the SAME [l] -- rather than at a [∃ l']
   -- is what keeps the audit a grep: a [∃ l'] post is equally sound and
   silently permits a licence swap, which would destroy the per-site
   documentation the increment exists for.

   iget SPENDS IT ON NOTHING.  The proof frames it across the whole
   function and hands it back on the two returning arms; the diverging
   panic arm drops it.  That is the honest shape -- iget never reads a
   dinode, so there is nothing here that COULD consume a licence, and
   §7.1.6's death certificate says so: the licence is returned at the iget,
   [iput] holds none, and §20.7's ordering wall is untouched.           *)

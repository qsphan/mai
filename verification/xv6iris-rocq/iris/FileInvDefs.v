(* FileInvDefs.v -- the open-file table's geometry, the reference-count
   algebra, and [file_ref]/[fslot]: what every consumer that merely HOLDS or
   LOOKS UP a file reference needs (starting with [ProcInv]'s [proc_priv],
   which threads a slot index through [p->ofile]).

   The design (and the reasoning behind the algebra) is written up in
   claude-notes/design/file-table.md; the short version:

     struct file { int type; int ref; char readable; char writable;
                   struct pipe *pipe; struct inode *ip; uint off; short major; }
     struct { struct spinlock lock; struct file file[NFILE]; } ftable;

   Three different disciplines govern the fields, and the model keeps them
   apart:

   * [ref] is protected by ftable.lock -- filealloc's scan reads the [ref]
     field of EVERY entry, so all NFILE of those cells live in the lock's
     resource and none of them ever travels with a reference.
   * the other fields are immutable while [ref > 0] and are read with no lock
     at all, so a reference has to carry a real points-to FRACTION of them.
   * [off] is mutable under ip->lock, and its ownership follows that
     discipline: an FD_INODE file's cell lives in the slot's OFF BOX
     (OffBox.v, a CtxBox instance whose L2 rows ride the inode's sleeplock
     payload) and the reference carries a share of that box ([off_fd]);
     any other file holds the word at the visibility-free tier
     ([off_free]).  design/ctx-box.md has the law.

   The two halves are tied together by one authoritative ghost map, keyed by
   slot index: [M !! k = Some (q,n)] says slot k has n outstanding references
   holding fraction q of the content between them, and [k ∉ dom M] says the
   slot is free.  Because [fracR] has no unit and [positiveR] no zero, a
   fragment [(q,1)] included in [(qt,n)] forces [n = 1 -> q = qt]: THE HOLDER
   OF THE ONLY REFERENCE HOLDS THE FULL FRACTION, hence write access.  That is
   what licenses sys_open's unlocked initialization of a fresh file and
   fileclose's [f->type = FD_NONE] at ref 0.

   ---- the PAYLOAD ----

   A [struct file] is a reference TO something: a pipe end (FD_PIPE) or an
   inode (FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE).  That resource rides INSIDE [file_ref], at
   the reference's own fraction, and is a FUNCTION of the file's content
   ([file_core]) -- which is what lets the exclusive holder publish a
   payload by storing to [f->type] and [f->pipe] with no lock held and no
   ghost step, exactly as pipealloc and sys_open do.  The one thing memory
   does not record is the payload's ghost identity, so that is a per-slot
   ghost FIELD ([fpay_tok]) beside the content cells, split by the same
   fractions and agreeing between holders; see the note above [fpnames] for
   why it cannot live on the authority.

   Two fraction laws are the whole of fileclose: [file_rest_absorb] (a
   departing reference's share goes back to the invariant) and
   [file_rest_join] (the last one takes the invariant's leftover, and so
   holds a WHOLE pipe end to hand to pipeclose) -- both in FileInv.v.

   ---- why this is its own file ----

   FileInv.v keeps [ftable_res]/[is_ftable] and the ~500 lines of ref-counting
   ghost-step lemmas ([file_alloc_step], [flive_*], [file_close_step], ...)
   that only filealloc/filedup/fileclose/sys_open/sys_pipe/sys_fork/kexit need
   to CHANGE a reference count.  [ProcInv] and everything downstream of it on
   the pipe-read critical path ([SchedCtx], [SpecPiperead], [ProofPiperead])
   only ever HOLD a [file_ref]/[fslot] -- they never allocate or close one --
   so splitting this slice out lets FileInv.v's heavier tail compile IN
   PARALLEL with [ProcInv]/[SchedCtx]/[SpecPiperead]/[ProofPiperead] instead
   of sitting as a serial prerequisite of all of them.  `Require Import
   FileInv` still gets everything (FileInv.v `Require Export`s this file);
   switch to `Require Import FileInvDefs` wherever only this slice is needed.

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
(*  The payload's ghost identity, and why it is a SEPARATE COMPONENT    *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* A [struct file] of type FD_PIPE owns a share of one END of a pipe
   (PipeInv.v).  [fcontent] records the pipe's ADDRESS -- that is all the
   memory says -- and a pipe's reference is indexed by its ghost names, so a
   payload share has to carry them.  Recording them under an existential
   ([PipeInv.pipe_held]) is not enough: two shares of one slot's payload would
   then not be recombinable, and recombining them is exactly what the last
   [fileclose] does when it takes [file_rest]'s leftover fraction back.

   So the names are a per-slot GHOST FIELD, fractional and agreeing, living
   beside the content cells and split by exactly the same fractions.  What
   fixes its shape is WHERE it has to be written:

   * pipealloc sets [f->type = FD_PIPE] and [f->pipe = pi] holding NO lock --
     it is the exclusive holder (ref == 1), and that is the whole licence.
     So installing the names must need no authority either, which rules out
     an [agree] component on the [frefUR] entry: a fragment of an [auth]
     cannot be updated without the authoritative element, and the authority
     is inside ftable.lock.
   * the fraction still has to agree between holders, and to come home to
     [file_rest] when a reference departs.

   A frac-times-agree gmap with NO authority does both: the exclusive holder
   ([q = 1]) can update the value by a frame-preserving update on its own
   fragment (nothing else can hold a share), and any two shares agree.  It is
   a second COMPONENT of the table's one ghost rather than a second ghost
   name, so that nothing above the file layer -- and no boot wiring -- learns
   that the payload has an identity at all.  The supply is minted with the
   authority ([ftable_ghosts_alloc]), every slot present; a free slot's entry
   is held by the invariant, exactly like its content cells.

   [fp_icv] is the FD_INODE arm's, and is a CANCELLABLE INVARIANT'S name
   rather than the inode's: see [inode_pay] for why a share of an inode
   reference cannot be the reference itself.

   [fp_iq] IS NOT A GHOST NAME, and it is the one field here that is a plain
   number: it is THE FRACTION OF THE INODE'S IDENTITY-AND-LIVENESS SLICE that
   this slot's FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE payload lends its holders, fixed when the
   file is published and unchanged for the file's life.  A holder of file
   fraction [q] carries [q * fp_iq] of it; the parked reference inside the
   cinv is SHORT by exactly [fp_iq], and the last closer's gather adds the two
   back up (see [inode_pay]).

   WHY IT HAS TO BE A CONSTANT RATHER THAN AN EXISTENTIAL.  An existential
   "some share" splits and rejoins freely, which would make
   [file_core_split] fall out for nothing -- and would make the inode
   UNFREEABLE.  [IcacheHeld.inode_held_gather] re-forms the canonical reference
   only from the EXACT fraction that was carved (canonical pairing, design
   §14.6/§14.7), and [IcacheInv.iref_close_last_step] then requires the final
   closer to hold the whole outstanding slice; so every sliver handed out has
   to come back, and an existential fraction lets a holder split and drop
   half.  With a constant, [file_core_split] is distributivity,
   [(q1 + q2) * Q = q1 * Q + q2 * Q].

   It lives HERE, in the per-slot names, because that is what this record is
   for: per-slot constants agreed across every holder by [fpay_tok].

   [fp_ig] IS THE INODE SLOT'S LIVENESS GENERATION (design fs-icache.md
   §17.6 (5), ratified §17.7), and it is [fp_iq]'s exact status: a per-slot
   CONSTANT fixed when the file is published.  It is what the fd's type
   witness is keyed on -- [inode_pay] carries [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot fp_ig ty]
   with "[ty] is not a directory if this fd is writable" and "[ty] is not a
   device if this fd is FD_INODE", and filewrite joins it to ilock's copy
   with [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot_agree].  It can be a constant
   because a live reference PINS the generation: a bump needs the slot's
   whole liveness unit, which does not exist while any share is outstanding
   ([IcacheInv.live_slot_alloc] at the recycle, [IcacheInv.live_slot_regen]
   at iput's REF-1 free window -- and this fd's share refutes both).

   THERE IS NO OFF-CINV NAME HERE ANY MORE (the old [fp_ocv]).  [off] is
   not a content field -- it is mutable under ip->lock by a holder of an
   arbitrarily small fraction -- but its home is no longer a per-slot
   cancellable invariant with a per-publication name: an FD_INODE file's
   cell sits in the slot's off BOX ([off_fd] below), and the reference
   carries a fractional share of that box instead of a cinv token.  The
   fragment needs no recorded name -- the ledger's gnames are the ambient
   [fsc_foff] family, keyed by the itable slot the payload already pins
   through [inode_shr_held_gen]. *)
(* [fp_inum] IS THE FILE'S INODE NUMBER, and it is [fp_iq]'s exact status one
   field over: a per-slot CONSTANT fixed when the file is published and
   unchanged for the file's life.  It is here rather than in [fcontent]
   because it is not a [struct file] field -- what the C struct records is
   [f->ip], the itable ENTRY, and entries are RECYCLED, so the pointer does
   not name a file across time.  The inum does.

   IT IS TIED, not merely recorded: [file_core]'s inode arm states
   [inode_pay] at THIS inum, and [inode_pay] carries
   [IcacheHeld.inode_shr_held_gen] at it -- whose [inode_ident] is a
   points-to on the entry's own [i_inum] cell.  So the field cannot drift
   from the machine, and two holders of one file agree on it for the same
   reason they agree on the rest of [pn] ([fpay_tok_agree]).

   On a PIPE or a free slot it is meaningless and unconstrained, exactly as
   [fp_pipe] is on an inode file.  It reaches a descriptor only through
   [file_ref]'s state index, which ignores it off the FD_INODE arm. *)

(* An FD_INODE file's [off] cell lives in the slot's off box ([off_fd]
   below), whose checkout is the box's (e) under ip->lock.  The
   EXCLUSIVE holder of a slot ([q = 1]) has to be able to refute a STALE
   checked-out state -- fileclose reclaims the cell holding no inode lock at
   all, so it has nothing to contradict the borrower's marker with.  What
   contradicts it is a COUNT: one fungible unit per outstanding reference,
   with the authority riding beside the reference-count authority inside
   ftable.lock.  At the last reference the authority records ONE, so a second
   unit -- the parked one -- is impossible, and the cell must be resident.

   THE COUNTER'S GNAME IS THE AMBIENT [FsCfg.fsc_fol], NOT the table's [γf]
   (off-ledger ruling): the ledger invariants park a unit in their
   checked-out arms, and a γf-keyed unit would force every ledger -- and
   hence [FsReady.fs_ready] and every environment that carries the family --
   to thread γf.  The unit still composes with the SAME authority inside
   ftable.lock ([ftable_auth] owns the [fsc_fol] column beside γf's), so the
   soundness story is unchanged: only the ghost location moved.  The
   counter's camera is its own [xv6G] member ([Xv6Cameras.flivG]) rather
   than a [fileUR] component, so the era fupd can mint the authority with
   no [fileG] in sight.

   The unit is [◯ {[k := 1%positive]}], a CLOSED element: that is what makes it
   FUNGIBLE, i.e. what lets a borrower prove that the token it takes back on
   return is the token it parked.  A slice of the borrower's own fraction is
   not fungible (the invariant hands it back existentially quantified) which is
   exactly why the marker cannot be one.

   [positiveR], not [natR], for the same reason the reference count uses it: a

(* THIS CLASS CARRIES ITS OWN CAMERA AND ITS OWN CONFIG, AND NOTHING ELSE.

   It used to carry [pipeG], [icacheG] and [cinvG] as superclasses too, for
   a good reason stated badly: "so that the ~100 files that merely mention
   [proc_priv] do not have to name the pipe layer's ghosts", with the rule
   "a file that needs both must take [fileG] alone and project: two instance
   paths to [inG Σ fracR] print identically and do not unify."

   The reason was right and the remedy was local.  Bundling pure capacity so
   that consumers name ONE class is exactly right -- it is why [Xv6G.xv6G]
   exists -- but a bundle per subsystem gives you as many instance paths as
   you have bundles, and the rule it forces ("take [fileG] alone") is
   unenforceable: twenty-seven files bound [fileG] and [!icacheG] side by
   side, and [FsReady.v] deliberately declared [icacheG]/[icfg] LAST so that
   resolution would prefer them.  That is the double path the rule was
   written to prevent, in the tree, compiling.

   So the three capacity classes moved to [xv6G], which is the ONE bundle,
   and this class keeps what is genuinely its own: the file table's camera,
   and [icfg] -- which is not capacity at all but a record of NAMES, so it
   does not belong in [xv6G] either.  A file that needs the file table now
   takes [xv6G] and [fileG]: one path to each. *)
(* THE TWO CONFIGURATION RECORDS RIDE ALONG, and the second one is new.

   [file_icfg] has been here since the file table first had to name the
   inode cache: "there is exactly one inode cache per system", so threading
   its gname would have put a filesystem ghost name on [ProcInv.proc_priv]
   and hence on the thirty-odd spec files that mention it (InodeRef.v).

   [file_fscfg] is the SAME argument for the REST of the file system, and it
   is here rather than as a binder of its own for a sharper reason.
   [FsReady.fs_ready] -- the one predicate that says "the file system is
   ready to operate" -- is stated at [fscfg]'s fields, and the whole point
   of it is to be CARRIED: forkret's not-forked arm produces it, the trap
   loop's residue holds it, every syscall reads it back.  So every interface
   on that path has to be able to NAME it: [SpecSyscall]'s environment,
   [UsertrapRes]'s residue, [SpecUservec]'s and [SpecUserretClosed]'s loop.
   Reaching them by adding a binder means adding it to sixteen files' worth
   of [Module Type] parameters and [Definition] signatures -- the interface
   sweep claude-notes/completed/explicit-cpuid.md is about, whose failure
   mode is a contract that compiles while meaning something else.  Reaching
   them through the class every one of those files ALREADY binds costs one
   field.

   AND SINCE RANK 1 THE CLASS IS THE ONLY PATH.  When [file_fscfg] landed,
   an fs contract still THREADED its own copy of every name in it and tied
   the two by a pure premise; the field was there so that the predicate
   could be NAMED at the interfaces that carry it.  Ranks 1a-1d removed the
   threading itself -- [cn], [γfs], [cov], [logstart], [γi], the itable
   lock, [dev], [nib], [inodestart], the log's names, the six device and
   allocator gnames and the image's three numbers, in that order -- so the
   fs contract surface now reads all of them off this class and off
   [file_icfg], and the tie records that used to relate the two spellings
   ([FsSyscalls.fs_world], [SpecFileclose.fclose_ties]) do not exist.  That
   is why the two-instance-path trap below is not a style rule: with no
   threaded copy left there is no second spelling to fall back on.

   NEITHER RECORD IS CAPACITY, which is why they are not in [Xv6G.xv6G] --
   see that file's "what is deliberately not here".  Both are per-boot
   VALUES (gnames, gsets, block numbers), so there is no camera and no
   second instance path to get wrong: a double path in a config record can
   only disagree about a VALUE, and resolution picks one instance per use
   site.  Files that used to bind [FSC : fscfg] beside [fileG] therefore
   drop the binder rather than keep both (FsReady.v, FsSyscalls.v,
   FirstTok.v). *)
(* THE OFF LEDGER'S CAPACITY ([ghost_mapG Σ nat unit]) IS DELIBERATELY NOT
   A FIELD HERE, and not a new field ANYWHERE: the class already has a
   member on the tree -- [Xv6Cameras.logG]'s [logtx_inG], which [TxPin]

   400 GB, re-run at 703 GB by [subG_fileGpreS]'s [solve_inG]; a second
   field on [Xv6G.xv6G] is two instance paths to one class and breaks
   [IcacheEscrow]'s [iFrame] on the log's own [↪[ln_tx …]] elements.  This
   file, BELOW the bundle, binds the class bare in its sections; everything

(* ---- THE CAPACITY-ONLY HALF (fs-cfg-boot.md stage 3) ------------------
   [fileG] is not obtainable before boot runs, and that is the whole
   obstruction the boot-era allocation exists to remove: its only
   constructors are [subG_fileΣ] -- which needs an AMBIENT [icfg] and
   [fscfg], i.e. two records nothing in the tree ever produced -- or a
   section binder.  So a boot fupd that wants to MINT the two records has
   nowhere to stand: the instance it is supposed to build is a premise of
   its own statement.

   [fileGpreS] is the way out, and it is [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc]'s
   own move for [fdslotG]/[irefslotG]/[pavG] applied once more: the class
   splits into the CAMERA (which the [gFunctors] fixes once, before any
   fupd) and the two per-boot VALUES (which the era fupd chooses).
   [FsCfgBoot.fs_cfg_alloc] runs at [fileGpreS], returns [icfg] and [fscfg]
   existentially, and the caller reassembles [fileG] with [fileG_of] below.

   [file_preG] is deliberately NOT declared as an instance ([::]).  If it
   were, a context holding both [fileGpreS Σ] and [fileG Σ] -- which the
   wiring site does hold, since it builds the latter from the former --
   would have TWO resolution paths to [inG Σ fileUR], the exact hazard
   this file's header records for the capacity classes that moved to
   [Xv6G.xv6G] ("two instance paths print identically and do not unify").
   Nothing needs it as an instance: the one consumer is [fileG_of].

   [subG_fileΣ] and [fileG] itself are UNTOUCHED here; retiring the former
   is stage 4's business, not this file's. *)

(* The immutable-while-referenced content of a [struct file]: every field but

   [off] is deliberately NOT here.  It is neither ftable-protected nor
   immutable-while-referenced: it is mutable under ip->lock, by a holder of an
   arbitrarily SMALL fraction of the reference (fileread does [f->off += r]
   holding whatever share its descriptor has).  A fractional content field
   cannot express that, so [off] lives in its own per-slot borrow invariant --
   [FileOff.v] -- and the only thing FileInv keeps of it is the CELL ADDRESS
   [a_foff] and the liveness counter the borrow protocol needs.  See the "off"
   note at the bottom of this file and design/file-table.md. *)

(*  ... AND THE PART OF IT A FILE DESCRIPTOR SHOWS ITS USER            *)
(* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* [FdSlots.fdstate] is the user-visible state of one descriptor; this says
   WHEN a state is the honest reading of a given file.  It is a RELATION and
   not a function of the file, for two reasons, and the second is the one
   that matters:

   - the inode NUMBER is not a [struct file] field.  What the struct records
     is [f->ip], the itable ENTRY, and entries are recycled, so [C] alone
     cannot say which file this is; the number comes from the reference
     parked in [f->ip], via [fpnames.fp_inum].

   - IT CONSTRAINS [fc_type] IN BOTH DIRECTIONS.  A function from files to
     states has to send the type codes it does not recognise somewhere, and
     the only honest target is [FdClosed] -- which would mean [FdClosed] told
     a holder nothing about [f->type].  Read as a relation each arm PINS the
     type: a descriptor in state [FdOpen (FdPipe _)] is on a file whose
     [f->type] is FD_PIPE, and one in state [FdClosed] is on an UNTYPED
     file.  That is what lets [file_ref] hide its [fcontent] entirely --
     everything a holder used to read off [C] at this altitude, it now reads
     off the state.

   [fc_readable] / [fc_writable] are deliberately not related here -- EXCEPT
   ON A PIPE, where they are complementary (see [fdpipe_ends] and the pipe
   arm below, lane PIPE-RO): this increment tracks only whether a descriptor
   is open, what KIND of file it names, and which one.  Adding the mode later
   is a field on [fdtype], not a change of shape.

   DEVICE FILES ARE NOT GIVEN THEIR INUM even though they hold an inode
   reference too and could be.  A device fd's identity to its user is the
   driver behind it, which is [fc_major]; the inode it was opened through is
   a mount detail.  If that turns out to be wanted it is another conjunct on
   the [FdDevice] arm, and this is the only site that would change.

   [γo] IS THE PAYLOAD'S OFFSET SHADOW NAME ([fpnames.fp_ooff]), and the
   FD_INODE arm pins the state's [γo] to it: the ghost a descriptor's user
   will be handed a half of is the one that sits beside THIS file's
   [f->off].  Like the inum it is a per-publish constant read off the
   payload names, so two holders of one file agree on it for free. *)
(* A PIPE FILE'S TWO ENDS ARE COMPLEMENTARY (lane PIPE-RO, design
   app-pipe.md SS4.3w's purchase 5; lane PQ-FLAG's "measured gap").
   [pipealloc] is the ONLY producer of an FD_PIPE file and it writes the two
   descriptors' mode cells at [1/0] and [0/1] -- the fact was true of the
   code and dropped at the store, which is why nothing above could tell a
   READ end from a WRITE end.  Published here, one conjunct on the pipe arm,
   it is what lets [fileread]'s pipe arm hand [SpecPiperead] the read end
   ([w = false], the mirror of [SpecPipewrite]'s [w = true]) and so lets
   [piperead] publish [ps_ro s = true] to the byte queue's links.

   IT IS A NAMED DEFINITION AND NOT AN INLINE CONJUNCTION, deliberately:
   [fdstate_ok]'s body is on the conversion path of every [Qed] that takes
   a row as a premise, so each branch stays ONE HEAD SYMBOL WIDE (lane
   PIPE-NEG1's measured [UShRound] wedge, durable-notes' lesson). *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* ---- AN FD_INODE FILE'S PAYLOAD: A SHARE OF ONE INODE REFERENCE ----

     The predicate this file carried as [emp] until C6b.  What replaced it
     is NOT [IcacheHeld.inode_held] at fraction [q], and the reason is the
     whole content of the definition:

     an icache reference is [iref_tok γ k q ∗ inode_ident k q dev inum],
     and its ghost fragment [◯ {[k := (q, 1%positive)]}] carries a COUNT of
     one.  Two of them compose to a count of TWO -- a second reference,
     which the itable would have to have handed out.  So [inode_held] does
     not split fractionally, at any fraction, and [file_core_split] --
     which is a genuine ⊣⊢, used leftwards by filedup and rightwards by
     fileclose -- cannot be satisfied by any function of [q] that mentions
     the token directly.  Recombining a resource that is not itself
     fractional out of fractional shares is exactly what a CANCELLABLE
     INVARIANT is for, and it is what [PipeInv] already does one layer down
     ([pipe_ref] carries [cinv_own (pn_cancel γp) (q/2)] beside its own
     fraction).  So: the reference goes into a [cinv], the persistent half
     rides every share, and the FRACTION is the cancel token.  The last
     closer -- and only it -- holds [cinv_own γx 1], cancels, and walks
     away with a WHOLE [inode_held] to give to iput.

     THE THIRD CONJUNCT, AND WHY THE PARKED REFERENCE IS SHORT (design §14.6's
     "share beside the cinv").  A cancel token alone says nothing ABOUT the
     inode: it cannot be read through, and it cannot discharge a contract that
     wants to know the entry is live -- which is exactly what a reader needs
     ([SpecFileread]'s [frn_s], and [SpecIlock] v3 behind it, both take an
     [IcacheRef.inode_shr]).  So a real slice travels beside the token.

     IT CANNOT BE CARVED OUT OF THE PARKED REFERENCE ON DEMAND, because the
     cinv's content is not accessible without cancelling it.  It is carved
     ONCE, when the payload is published ([inode_pay_alloc]), and what goes
     into the cinv is therefore the parent SHORT by the whole outstanding
     slice: [IcacheHeld.inode_held_short v (fp_iq pn)].  That is not a breach of
     canonical pairing -- [inode_ref_short] IS the design's name for a parent
     with a share out, and the pairing is restored by the gather, which is the
     last closer's move ([inode_pay_cancel]) and happens before iput ever sees
     the reference.  Nothing can spend the parked reference in the meantime:
     the cinv is the only holder and cancelling it is what the closer does.

     The travelling slice is PROPORTIONAL, [q * fp_iq pn], so that the split
     law is distributivity and the closer at [q = 1] holds exactly the
     [fp_iq pn] the cinv is short by.  See the header above [fpnames] for why
     the constant cannot be an existential.

     [v] is the pointer, not the slot: [ientry_inj] makes them the same
     thing, and the file table has no vocabulary for a slot -- which is why
     both [inode_held_short] and [inode_shr_held] are stated at the pointer. *)
  Definition fileipN : namespace := nroot .@ "fileip".

  (* THE FOURTH CONJUNCT: THE FD'S TYPE WITNESS (design fs-icache.md §17.6
     (5), ratified §17.7).  filewrite's FD_INODE arm must rebuild
     [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded], whose [DirView.dir_ok] constrains a
     DIRECTORY's data bytes -- and an arbitrary user write into a directory
     breaks it.  The real xv6 invariant is five frames up: sys_open refuses
     writable directory fds.  This is where it crosses.

     The travelling share is therefore GENERATION-NAMED, and the witness is
     that generation's one-shot: ilock's postcondition hands filewrite
     [ity_shot g (di_type dn)] at the caller's [g], this payload holds
     [ity_shot g ty] with [ty <> T_DIR], [IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot_agree] joins
     them, and [DirView.dir_ok_not_dir] finishes.  A generation sees at most
     one fill (§17.6), which is what makes the agreement mean something.

     CONDITIONAL ON [wr], NOT UNCONDITIONAL: an O_RDONLY directory fd is
     legal and fileread never needs the fact.  [wr] is [fc_wbool C] at the
     call site in [file_core], and FD_DEVICE selects this payload too but
     never reaches writei.

     THE FIFTH CONJUNCT: THE FD_INODE ARM'S "NOT A DEVICE" (owner's ruling,
     2026-08-29).  sys_open writes [f->type = FD_DEVICE] EXACTLY when
     [ip->type == T_DEVICE] and FD_INODE otherwise, so an FD_INODE
     descriptor's parked inode is a regular file or a directory -- never a
     device.  The fact was true of the code and dropped at the store, which
     left the fourth conjunct as the payload's only type witness: it
     excludes a DIRECTORY on a writable fd and nothing else.  That gap is
     what forced a spurious third arm on the write contract (a T_DEVICE
     inode behind an FD_INODE fd, on which [FsAbs.abs_node] reads [ADev] and
     writei moves no field the abstract view can see) and blocked read's
     "FdInode => AFile or ADir" custody tie.  This is where it crosses, and
     [SpecFilewrite]'s two arms are keyed on the return value alone
     because of it.

     IT IS KEYED ON THE DESCRIPTOR'S TYPE, WHICH IS WHY [fdty] IS A
     PARAMETER.  One payload serves both typed arms ([file_core] selects it
     on FD_INODE or FD_DEVICE), and on the FD_DEVICE arm the claim is FALSE
     -- the parked inode is precisely a device there.  So the conjunct is
     unconditional in [wr] (unlike the fourth) and conditional on the FD's
     own type word, which is [fc_type C] at the call site, exactly as [wr]
     is [fc_wbool C].  On the device arm the implication is vacuous by
     [FD_DEVICE <> FD_INODE], which is what its publisher discharges.

     THE NUMBER IS [FsImg.T_DEVICE_z], QUALIFIED AND NOT RESTATED.  FsImg is
     already in this file's cone (through [FsCfg]), so the constant is
     nameable without importing the disk-image layer for one integer --
     [ProofSysOpenStores] spells it the same way.  Its sibling [T_DIR_z]
     is unqualified only because [DirView] is imported here for the fourth
     conjunct's sake.

     Everything here is PERSISTENT except the cinv token and the share, so
     [inode_pay_split]'s distributivity is untouched. *)
  (* [inum] IS NAMED HERE, and that is the only change the fd-state ghost
     needed of this layer: the slice this payload carries already pinned the
     inum through [inode_ident], it was simply ∃-bound.  Naming it costs the
     consumers that do not care nothing -- an [∃ inum] in front of the

     filewrite and fileread ([IcacheRefDefs.ity_shot_agree] joins the two, the

  (* [off_resident] MOVED to FileOffCell.v (r25 shapes): the box's header

  (* [f->writable] as the BOOL that indexes the pipe's two ends -- the same
     bool pipeclose takes as its second argument, and the truth value of the
     byte fileclose loads with [lbu]. *)
  (* WHAT THE FILE OWNS, as a function of its CONTENT and its payload names.
     A function of [C] alone (given the names) is what lets the exclusive
     holder publish a payload by STORING to [f->type] and [f->pipe]: there is
     no ghost step to perform and no lock to hold, which is precisely the
     situation pipealloc and sys_open are in.

     The free state pins [fc_type = FD_NONE], so a free slot carries no
     payload -- which is the real xv6 invariant: fileclose writes FD_NONE
     before releasing, and the BSS starts zeroed.

     THE OFF CONJUNCT IS TYPE-INDEXED (tso-cutover r25, item 24): the
     FD_INODE arm is the fd's share of the slot's off BOX ([off_fd]); every
     other arm holds the [f->off] word at the visibility-free tier
     ([off_free]).  Publishing to FD_INODE is the one payload change with a
     ghost step (the box's birth, under the inode's lock at sys_open's
     stores); every other retype is a pure store. *)
  (* THE ENTRY'S IREF UNIT RIDES THE UNTYPED AND PIPE ARMS.  [IREFSLOTS]
     provisions one unit per ftable entry ([IrefSlots.v]'s header: "each
     ftable entry holding an FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE file"), and this is where
     that unit lives when the entry is NOT holding an inode reference: a free
     slot's payload holds it, so does a pipe's.  The FD_INODE / FD_DEVICE arm
     holds none, because there the unit has been SPENT -- it is what justifies
     the reference parked in [f->ip], which is exactly what [inode_pay] is.

     This is why [IrefSlots]'s counter is fractional.  The arm splits with
     [q] (filedup hands out shares of one file), so a unit that could not
     split could not live here at all -- and the alternatives all fail: at
     [q = 1] the invariant's [file_rest] is [emp] and cannot see the type, a
     descriptor's [ofile_slot] would need one unit per REFERENCE where the
     supply provisions one per FILE, and nothing can move into or out of the
     table when sys_open types the file, because filealloc has released
     ftable.lock by then.

     What it buys: sys_open's ledger CLOSES.  filealloc hands out an untyped
     slot, so its caller gets the unit for free; sys_open spends it retyping
     to FD_INODE, and its net is zero.  sys_pipe's stays inside the reference
     and rides into the descriptor.  At the last close the holder has [q = 1],
     so a WHOLE unit either way -- from here on the pipe arm, from [iput] on
     the inode arm -- which is what goes back into the freed slot.  Neither
     the type nor the lastness has to appear in fileclose's postcondition. *)

  (* ---- THE predicate: holding one reference on file slot [k] ----

     The unit of ownership everywhere a [struct file *] is held: a process's
     p->ofile[fd], a syscall's local [struct file *f], pipealloc's two
     half-built files.  It is NOT persistent and NOT duplicable -- duplicating
     it is filedup, which must run under ftable.lock and bump the physical
     count.  [file_ref γ k 1 st] is the exclusive (writable) state.

     ---- WHY [st] IS AN ARGUMENT ------------------------------------------

     [st] is THE USER-VISIBLE STATE OF ANY DESCRIPTOR NAMING THIS FILE
     ([FdSlots.fdstate]), and a reference carries it because a reference is
     precisely what a descriptor holds.  [ProcInv.ofile_slot] then reads

         file_ref γf k q st ∗ fd_st_auth γd fd st

     -- the fd's ghost is the reference's own index, not a function applied
     to it -- and "this descriptor is open" is literally [st <> FdClosed].

     It is REDUNDANT of the CONTENT and that is deliberate: [st] is
     pinned by the reference's own [C] and [fp_inum].  What it
     adds is A PLACE TO PUT THE INUM.  The type and major number are [struct
     file] fields, so [C] has them; the inode NUMBER is not -- the struct
     holds [f->ip], the itable ENTRY, and entries are recycled, so the
     pointer does not name a file across time.  The number lives one layer
     down in [fp_inum], under [file_pay]'s quantifier, and indexing the
     reference is what lifts it out to where a descriptor can state it.

     ---- AND WHY [C] IS NOT AN ARGUMENT ------------------------------------

     It used to be.  Nothing outside the file layer ever projected a field of
     it: the ten files of the descriptor layer ([ProcInv], sys_close / dup /
     read / write / fstat, kexit, kfork, fdalloc) contain ZERO occurrences of
     [fc_type] and friends.  They named [C] only to pass it along, and every
     one of them already had it under a quantifier of its own -- [ofile_slot]
     and [proc_ofiles_lend] both bound it existentially, so the argument was
     doing nothing but forcing each of those sites to introduce a variable
     and thread it.

     The file layer DOES read the fields -- fileread steps through
     [lw a5, f->type] and has to know what it loaded -- but it reads them off
     [file_fields], which it gets by taking the reference apart.  Opening the
     existential is that same step.

     THE CONSEQUENCE FOR THE LOAN WINDOW.  [ProcInv.proc_ofiles_lend] hands
     a descriptor's ghost authority out WITH the reference; because both name
     [st], a syscall cannot put back a reference to a DIFFERENT file than the
     one the fd's ghost still claims.  A bare reference plus a free-floating
     authority could, and nothing would catch it. *)

  (* [fdstate_ok_parked], [file_ref_parked] AND [file_ref_parked_keep] ARE
     DELETED (lane OFF-LINK), and with them [ProcInv]'s whole chain
     ([ofile_slot_parked] -> [ofile_slots_parked] -> [proc_ofiles_parked]
     -> [proc_priv_parked]).  They read [fdstate_ok]'s [m = OffParked] pin
     off a reference and carried it up to "every row of this key's table is
     parked", which is the fact design/app-file.md SS3.5's principle
     retires: the generic tier pays the TAINT instead of being told
     anything about offsets.  Not one of them had an application anywhere
     in the tree (lane OFF-HAND-7, measurement 1: every hit outside their
     own files is a comment), and the four row-copying sites take the row
     PERSISTENTLY again (this lane's L1), so the deletion is free at the
     pin's current strength and stays free when the pin moves to
     [fpnames.fp_om]. *)

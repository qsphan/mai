(* SpecScheduler.v -- the public interface of Scheduler, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

   scheduler() is the per-CPU dispatch loop and NEVER RETURNS, so this spec
   has no continuation: the conclusion is a bare [WP Loop {{Φ}}].  It is
   entered (from main, at boot) at interrupt level noff = 0 with interrupts
   DISABLED ([cpu_own γ 0 false ...]) and the spare half of [c->proc] in
   hand; the entry value of c->proc is
   irrelevant (∀ p0 -- the first thing the body does is store 0 there), and
   the cpu context slot holds the raw 14-word save area ([cpu_ctx_free], the
   boot shape) -- the scheduler is the party that parks itself there.

   Interrupt accounting (see claude-notes/projects/scheduler.md): the loop
   head's inlined intr_on/intr_off ([csrsi]/[csrci sstatus,2]) flip the SIE
   arm at level 0, which consumes [trap_csrs] (the ∃-valued sepc/scause/stval
   cells -- a taken trap scribbles them, so the enabled arm must own them)
   and [IntrDefs.intr_res] inside them (trapinithart has installed
   kernelvec).  A dispatch round can hand the scan back at eb = true (the
   parked proc's release re-enables), so both are genuinely consumed and
   re-emerge round by round; the spec takes them once, at the boot shape
   (interrupts off, cells client-side).

   The scheduler is the supplier of the chain's dispatch payload and the
   consumer of its parking payload (SchedCtx.p_sched); [procs_inv] provides
   the 64 proc locks. *)

  (* [kv_frame_slots + 22], NOT [22] -- ONE reserve, paid ONCE.
     scheduler() is entered from main() with interrupts OFF, and the [intr_on]
     inlined at its loop head ([csrsi sstatus,2] at +0x86) is therefore a
     genuine 0 -> 1 enable at a point where NOBODY holds the trap reserve: it
     has to fund [kv_frame_slots] out of the scheduler's own budget, exactly
     like sleep's re-enabling release.  It is funded once and for all: on
     every later round the arm is already [true] (the dispatch tail's release
     at level 0 with [intena] re-enabled it), the same [csrsi] is an
     IDEMPOTENT set that moves neither ghost state nor the index
     ([WpSconfCsr.wp_csrsi_sstatus_x0_idem_s_sconf]), and the reserve carved
     on the first round is simply still there.  So the premise is
     [kv_frame_slots + <loop body need>] with NO factor of two -- carrying the
     arm-generic enable leaf around the loop instead would demand room to set
     aside [kv_frame_slots] in a state where they are ALREADY set aside, i.e.
     [2 * kv_frame_slots + 20], which is the pathology the arm-dependent carve
     exists to remove. *)

     already took the trap cells from. *)

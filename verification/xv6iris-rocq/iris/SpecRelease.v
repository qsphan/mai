(* SpecRelease.v -- the public interface of Release, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof
   file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   The [locked γl cpu_id] token is the whole precondition on the lock side: it
   says this hart holds the lock AND pins [lk->cpu] at this hart's [struct cpu]
   (which is what makes release's own [holding(lk)] check return 1).  Both lock
   words live in the invariant, so no cell is threaded.

   THREE statements, ONE proof.  Release's last store to the lock word is the
   moment -- the only moment -- at which the lock's storage can change hands:
   the state ghost is back at [None] and the two words and [R] are all in hand
   together, so whether the invariant closes again or is destroyed has to be
   decided right there.  [wp_release_gen_sconf_body] takes that decision as a
   parameter (a [lock_finisher], WpLock.v) and hands its output [Out] back to
   the caller; [RELEASE] and [RELEASE_CANCEL] below are its two instances:

     RELEASE         -- the static kernel lock: no credential, no disposal,
                        nothing comes back out.  Verbatim what the thirteen
                        ordinary consumers were written against.
     RELEASE_CANCEL  -- the kalloc'd object's lock: release RECLAIMS the
                        lock's own two words along with whatever the caller
                        makes of [R], which is what lets pipeclose [kfree]
                        the page. *)

(* The generic form.  release opens the lock invariant at four instructions
   and presents, at each, the very token it is already holding -- [locked] for
   the first three and [locked_pre] for the word clear.  That is not a
   convenience: by the time release runs, the object's last REFERENCE has
   necessarily gone home, and the lock is all its closer has left.  So what
   the caller owes is a refutation of the dead state [Dc] from each token.

   The finisher's mask is the step engine's [⊤ ∖ ↑minstretN]: the choice is
   made INSIDE the atomic store, so no other hart can see the window in which
   the lock is free but its storage already spoken for. *)

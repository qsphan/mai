(* ProofUserretClosed.v -- THE TRAP LOOP, closed.

   [SpecUserretClosed]'s theorem is userret's spec with no premise about
   what happens at user mode and no [stvec_handler_wp]: the machine is
   entered where the kernel first enters this loop (forkret's tail, at
   [uva 0x9c]) and runs forever.  What closes it is a Löb induction whose
   cut point is [UserExec.stvec_handler_wp] itself, taken at ANY hart, ANY
   config record and ANY address space:

     userret -> user mode -> uservec -> usertrap -> userret -> ...

   [wp_uservec_pt] already chains usertrap and userret, so one round of the
   loop is ONE application of it: from the trap frame it runs the whole
   kernel excursion and lands back in USER mode, at the resuming hart, with
   the address space in the user view.  All this file does is hand that
   CONCRETE state, and the next round's contract, to the PER-PROCESS
   CONTINUATION user execution itself handed back at the trap.

   THE KEYED CONTRACT (MILESTONE J).  The loop no longer circulates a
   forall-state WP.  Its Löb hypothesis is now [UexecRet.ukb]'s body: the
   trapped machine at the user-visible record [W] that trapped, with the
   cause and tval NAMED, paired with [UexecRet.uexec_ret sc W] -- what a
   verified program can actually produce.  At the round's end the loop
   re-keys that return onto the record the round left ([UexecApply], steps
   A/B: [uexec_ret_run] moves the key onto the run projection the round's
   relation is stated at, then [UexecRound.uround_ok]'s own arm picks which
   of [uexec_ret]'s arms pays), meets [uslot]'s guard by computation, and
   builds the U-mode bundle ([UexecApply.ukc_apply], step D).  Everything
   between the round's post and the next [mWP Loop] is in those two named
   lemmas: this is a whole-function continuation, so an inline discharge
   would be paid at every step of the walk (optimization.md, RULE ONE).

   THIS FILE MINTS, AND ONLY ON TWO ARMS (refutation R-c).  [UserretClosed]
   takes a [UEXEC_GEN] again, for exec-success -- where [uround_ok]'s left
   disjunct says NOTHING, by design, because the new program's slot is
   exec's to build -- and for fork, where nothing yet states [r <> 0] (K2).
   The mint goes through [UexecCond.cond_entry_slot], so a process whose key
   qualifies picks up sync's own constructor.  Every other arm spends what
   user execution returned.  See claude-notes/design/user-wp-slot.md.

   TWO THINGS THAT ARE NOT PLUMBING.

   [Rut] IS THE RESIDUE, AND uservec MUST NOT BE GIVEN IT TWICE.  The
   kernel-side bundle parks across user execution as the bundle's [Rut]
   conjunct -- that is what [Rut] is for -- so at the trap it arrives INSIDE
   [trapped_machine].  But [wp_uservec_pt] takes the frame AND the residue
   as separate premises, so handing it both would claim the same bundle
   twice and the precondition would be unsatisfiable.  The loop therefore
   OPENS the frame, takes the residue out, and rebuilds it at
   [Rut := fun _ => emp] for uservec.  Nothing is lost: uservec's own post
   does not mention [Rut] at all.  The residue is WHOLE again (R-a): the
   slot never rides it, so there is no hole to fill -- what crosses
   [wp_uservec_pt]'s park is the loop's own framed [uexec_ret] (K8: nothing
   on that crossing is persistent, so a linear resource travels).

   THE CONFIG RECORD IS REBUILT EVERY ROUND.  [mideleg]'s value is a genuine
   existential of usertrap's exit ([sconf] never pinned it), so the [ucfg]
   the next round runs at is not the one this round ran at -- only its shape
   is.  [loop_ucfg] is that shape, and its three proof fields are what the
   round has to re-establish: [uc_tvd] from stvec's pinned value, [uc_mm]
   from the post's own mask fact, and [uc_del] from [medeleg = MEDELEG_S],
   which is [SpecUserretClosed.medeleg_S_delegates] -- a closed computation, because
   [start()] fixes the delegation word once and nothing writes it again. *)

  (* [Rut], instantiated: the kernel-side bundle, parked inside the trapped
     machine across user execution -- WHOLE, not holed.  R-a deleted the
     hole: the slot no longer rides the residue at all, the LOOP frames
     [UexecRet.uexec_ret] across [wp_uservec_pt]'s park crossing instead
     (K8: nothing on that crossing is persistent, so a linear resource
     travels).  Hart-indexed because the residue is.

     THE SIZE IS PART OF THE PREDICATE, and it is not decoration.
     [UV.wp_uservec_pt] takes the entry frame at the RESIDUE INDEX's own
     [p->sz], while the loop holds it at the [sz] the key was resumed under;
     nothing else ties the two, so the park records the tie it establishes
     by construction.  The DESCRIPTOR needs no such row: [loop_ok]'s
     [ud_data = ud_pas] makes [ProcPtOwn.ud_norm] the identity on [pt], so
     the loop re-keys the index onto [pt] itself when it reads the residue
     back ([UV.usertrap_res_bare_norm]). *)
  (* THE RESIDUE THE LOOP PARKS ACROSS USER EXECUTION, WITHOUT THE
     DESCRIPTOR FRAGMENTS -- they are in the process's bundle for the

     There is no "residue minus the fragments" DEFINITION to hold: the
     ∀-general closer [UsertrapRes.ut_res_bare_fd_open] hands back IS that
     residue, and this is where it lives.  Applying it to the fragments the
     bundle returns at the trap rebuilds the real thing.

     [γfd] IS PINNED, and that is what makes the arrangement work.  [Rut] is
     [uptd -> iProp], so it cannot mention the states -- but the loop's Löb
     hypothesis has to carry [fd_frags γfd (uvis_fd W)] beside the machine,
     and nothing would otherwise say that those fragments belong to THIS
     process.  The pin says it, so the closer accepts them. *)

  (* [cs] IS AN INDEX, beside [sz]/[γfd]/[cw] and for their reason: the
     residue is indexed by the children set ([UsertrapRes.ut_own]'s
     [WaitInv.ch_frag]) and the key's [UexecSlot.uvis_ch] is a READING of
     it, so the loop has to name it on both sides of user execution.  The
     ROW ITSELF STAYS INSIDE the residue -- unlike the descriptor
     fragments, which come out to the process: nothing between the
     trap-out and the trap-in can move the set (moving it takes
     <wait_lock>), and the program mirrors the reading with
     [UserChildren.uch]. *)
  (* ...AND THE PID, the residue's own index now ([UsertrapRes.ut_res_bare]):
     the loop hands usertrap the number its block is at, and the resume key
     is built at the same one, so getpid's answer and the kernel's cell are
     one value by construction. *)
  (* ...AND THE LAZY BIT, the residue's own index on the [cw] precedent
     (lane LAZY-FLAG, K1): the round's key carries it
     ([UexecSlot.uvis_lazy]) and the BLOCK is where it lives
     ([ProcDefs.pv_lazy]), so the loop -- which holds the block across user
     execution -- is what ties the two.  fork's deposit is the consumer:
     the child's key is built at the parent's bit, and without this pin
     nothing here could say which bit that is. *)

  (* THE FULL-BUNDLE INTERFACE: a parked coroutine's record stores, beside
     its saved registers, ITS OWN free stack ([av] slots below the saved sp
     -- sp is callee-saved and pinned by [callee_img], so on resume the stack
     re-attaches to the fresh file).  THE PARKED DEPTH IS PLAIN [av], NOT
     [kv_frame_slots + av]: the record parks EXACTLY what its own resume wand
     below requires, and that wand hands in [sie_cap_gpr m av false p] -- at
     the interrupts-OFF index, whose carve is [trap_res false + av] = [av]
     ([IntrDefs.trap_res_off]).  A resumed party owes NO trap reserve, and
     that is not an accident of this record: a swtch resumption always
     happens holding a lock with interrupts off (level-1 [intr_count]), so
     [false] is the only index a resumption can be at.  Under the old
     arm-blind carve these two spellings coincided; they now differ by 78,
     and parking the larger one would be a record nothing can ever discharge.
     [p] is an
     INDEX of the context, not a record existential: the protocol pre-sets
     c->proc before every dispatch (the scheduler's c->proc = p store; a
     parking proc never touches it), every wrapper user KNOWS its
     context's p (proc j's context is indexed by proc_addr j; the parked
     scheduler's by the proc it was dispatching), and both directions of
     a crossing happen at the same c->proc value -- so the hand-off's
     resumer-record carries the SAME index and the swtch spec ties the
     caller's [cpu_own] p to the target's index directly.  The base-enable index is [∀ eb'] -- the RESUMER's:
     swtch itself performs NO stores to struct cpu, so at this altitude
     the intena cell physically still holds the resumer's state; the
     same-eb contract lives one level up (SpecSched), realized by sched's
     own epilogue intena store + ghost retune.  Level 1 = xv6's
     noff==1-at-swtch invariant; slot [emp]: the in-flight context cells
     ride separately.  The stack-free crossing remainder ([swconf] below)
     is internal to the swtch proof. *)
  (* THE ∀h RESUME WAND.  The record's owned pieces (its cells, its parked
     stack) are hart-independent memory and sit OUTSIDE the quantifier -- which
     is what makes a MIGRATABLE record affordable: one copy of the resources,
     one continuation good at every hart.  Everything a resumption HANDS IN is
     spelled at the resuming hart [h] ([sie_cap_gpr],
     [cpu_own] and [pc_is] are ambient-instance predicates, instantiated here
     at [CID := h]), and the conclusion is that hart's own [mWP (LoopE h)].
     The SIE ghost needs no binder of its own: it is [sie_name h], so
     rebinding [h] rebinds it -- and a MIGRATABLE record still names no
     hart, which is what lets [SchedCtx.procs_inv] store one. *)

(* THE SAVE AREA'S RE-INDEX, PAID (the machine flip; tso-machine-flip.md
   §6 amendment A6.58).  OUTSIDE the section, because the section's ambient
   [XI] fixes the index this must vary.

   WHAT CHANGED AND WHY.  The SC-era body was [ctx_word_to_mem] followed by
   [ctx_word_of_mem] -- a FREE re-index, and the flip refutes it exactly:
   a [ctx_pointsto] carries its clean/dirty justification AT ITS OWN
   CONTEXT ([TsoCtx]'s [llb (ctx_bound_name ξ) t] / dirty fragment), and
   nothing above the interp can re-mint that elsewhere.  The honest law is
   already in the kit and this payload is precisely what it is for:
   [TsoCtx.CtxMorph] transports any structural payload along a
   [ctx_dom ξ ξ'], and a save area is fourteen word cells and nothing else.

   So the re-index KEEPS ITS NAME AND GAINS ITS PRICE -- one [ctx_dom]
   token, which the park/resume protocol already mints
   ([ctx_dom_to_stamped] / [ctx_dom_of_stamped]).  Its one caller
   ([ProofScheduler]) is the M2 worklist entry that price creates; it is
   NOT a quarantine, because the obligation is now stated in the type.

   The morph fact is a plain lemma, not a [Global Instance]: it is applied
   AS A TERM at the two uses below, which keeps it out of every downstream
   file's instance search. *)

  (* The counting token does NOT ride here: it crosses inside the chain
     payload's [cpu_own] (SchedCtx.cpu_cells), whose context-slot argument
     is [emp] at the crossing -- the suspender's slot content is exactly
     the target-context resource it feeds to the swtch, and the resumed
     party re-fills the slot from its own swtch's returned cells.

     The SIE arm crosses as the BARE '0' EIGHTH [intr_off_tok], not the
     indexed [sie_cap]/[sie_arm b]: a scheduler swtch always runs
     interrupts-off (noff >= 1 on both sides), and the swtch proof needs
     the SIE=0 pin for its block engine.  This is no longer merely a
     convention: [cpu_own]'s own [1] level (the [S _] arm of
     [IntrDefs.intr_count]) unconditionally holds the ghost eighth at
     '0' REGARDLESS of [eb'], so a [sie_cap]/[sie_arm b] eighth held
     alongside it is forced to agree at [b = false] by ghost_var_frac
     agreement -- [valid_context_pre]'s resume wand below states that
     forced value directly (literal [false]) rather than re-deriving it
     from a case split. *)

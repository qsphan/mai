   @ KernelSyms.kfork = 0x80001c76, 270 bytes: a 64-byte ra/s0/s1/s4/s5 frame
   (s2/s3/s4 LAZILY spilled -- see below), the two `if` failure tails, the
   trapframe word-copy loop (+0x4a..+0x58, four words/iteration), the
   [filedup] scan over [NOFILE] descriptors, and the two lock crossings
   ([np->lock] release/reacquire around [wait_lock]'s acquire/write/release).

   THE SHRINK-WRAPPED EPILOGUE.  Three exits share ONE tail (+0xfc,
   `mv a0,s1; <pop ra/s0/s1/s5>; ret`), but s2/s3/s4 are pushed/popped only
   on the arms that actually use them (kexit.md's "a lazily-spilled
   callee-saved register makes [callee_saved] a PREMISE of the epilogue" --
   the exact same shape here):
     - allocproc fails (+0x16): jumps straight past the s2/s3/s4 reloads --
       neither register was ever touched, so the CALLER'S values are still
       sitting in the physical registers, untouched.
     - uvmcopy fails (+0x7c): s4 (=np) WAS written, so its slot is reloaded
       before the jump; s2/s3 were never touched (they are pushed only after
       uvmcopy SUCCEEDS), so they are not reloaded either.
     - success: falls through the ordinary `ld s2,32(sp); ld s3,24(sp);
       ld s4,16(sp)` sequence.

   THERE IS NO PAGE COUNT.  kfork is reached from [sys_fork] and from
   nowhere else, so it never runs in the allocator's COUNTED regime: the
   precondition is [kalloc_env_at γa γk None] outright, not a generic
   [on : option nat].  Two things follow and both simplify the contract.

   First, allocproc is called with no budget, so both of its own [freeproc]
   failure tails are LIVE code here (claude-notes/projects/
   proc-struct-resources.md, "S7 -- allocproc in the UNCOUNTED regime").

   Second, and this is what shrinks [kfork_post]: at [None] every arm
   reports the SAME thing.  [uvmcopy] and [freeproc] are stated only at
   [kalloc_env_at γa γk None], so the two arms past "found a slot" were always
   going to report it; and the "no free slot" arm, which used to be able to
   hand the caller's own [on] back untouched, now hands back [None] too --
   while [allocproc_post]'s third disjunct degenerates, since
   [avail_sub None n] is [None] and [avail_zero None] is [True], so its
   "the allocator ran dry after n pages" witness says nothing.  So
   [kalloc_env_at γa γk None] is hoisted OUT of the disjunction, beside
   [proc_priv], and the three arms collapse to TWO: the return value is
   either -1 or the child's pid, and that is the whole of what the arms
   still distinguish.

   NOTHING ABOUT THE CHILD COMES BACK, on EITHER of the two arms that reach
   a stable final state for it.  On the uvmcopy-failure arm, [freeproc]
   fully reclaims the slot to [proc_dormant _ UNUSED] and its lock is
   released, so the slot is back in [procs_inv] (persistent) with nothing
   owed to the caller.  On the success arm the child is parked at RUNNABLE,
   also inside [procs_inv], and design/proc-struct.md's "USED/RUNNING maps
   to emp" note is exactly what licenses NOT threading the child's private
   block back out through kfork's own postcondition -- it was handed
   entirely to the RUNNABLE park (a Löb argument about `forkret`, assumed
   here as [SpecForkretPark.FORKRET_PARK] -- see [ProofKfork.v]'s header for
   why that is a NEW, honest assumption and not a design shortcut).  Either
   way [kfork_post] says only: the return value, and [kalloc_env] at its
   final state.

   THE PARENT COMES BACK UNCHANGED, ON EVERY ARM.  kfork only ever READS
   [p]'s fields (pagetable/sz for uvmcopy, the trapframe contents, each
   [ofile] slot for [filedup], [cwd] for [idup], [name] for [safestrcpy]) --
   it writes nothing into the parent's block on any path -- so
   [proc_priv γf pme pid_p Vp] is taken as a precondition and handed back
   verbatim, exactly as [SpecUvmcopy.v]'s own "the parent's table comes back
   verbatim" note already says about the one piece of it uvmcopy itself
   touches.

   [pme] IS THE PARENT.  Every other whole-function contract in this tree
   names "the calling process" through [cpu_own]'s own [p] parameter rather
   than through a separate premise on [myproc()]'s result (myproc's own
   contract, [SpecMyproc.v], returns exactly THAT [p]), and kfork is no
   different: [pme] is both [cpu_own]'s process index and the parent [p] the
   C source calls [myproc()] to get.

   THE CWD REFERENCE IS INSIDE THE TWO [proc_priv] BLOCKS, WHICH IS WHY
   THIS CONTRACT NO LONGER NAMES AN INODE.  kfork runs
   [np->cwd = idup(p->cwd)], and [SpecIdup.v] wants a real
   [IcacheInv.inode_ref] on the entry [p->cwd] names.  That used to be a
   PREMISE -- together with [pv_cwd Vp = ientry ck] and the four parameters
   [ck cq cdev cinum] -- because [ProcInv.cwd_ref] was [emp] and the
   parent's own block could not produce it.  It is real now
   ([InodeRef.iref_at]), so the parent's block DOES produce it: the slot,
   the device and the inum are read off [cwd_ref (pv_cwd Vp)] inside
   [ProofKforkB4], idup's two halves go back into the parent's block and
   into the CHILD's, and nothing about an inode appears here or in
   [kfork_post].

   What is left of the icache is only what the LOCK needs:
   [IcacheEscrow.is_itable2 fsc_itlock fsc_ic fsc_fs fsc_ireg fsc_cov fsc_logst nib icfg_dev] (which drags
   the disk and log fabric -- [fsc_fs], [fsc_cov], [fsc_logst], [nib] -- along) and
   [itable_inv].  No coherence side condition ties the caller's lock to
   [ProcInv.cwd_ref]'s reference: both are stated over the same canonical
   [IcacheInv.iref_name] by construction, so there is nothing left to
   equate; [InodeRef.v]'s header explains why the authority's gname is
   canonical instead of threaded.

   THE CHILD IS HANDED OVER AS A DEFICIT BLOCK AND COMES BACK WHOLE.
   allocproc returns [ProcInv.proc_priv_nocwd] -- a process whose [p->cwd]
   is still 0 holds no reference and does not satisfy [proc_priv] -- and
   kfork's [sd a0,336(s4)] at +0xac is what closes the construction window,
   with idup's second half.  That is the whole reason idup returns two.

   AND THE [iref_slot] IS NOT A PREMISE EITHER.  What makes [ip->ref++]
   safe is one unit of [IrefSlots]' fixed supply, and it comes out of
   ALLOCPROC with the child's block -- allocproc is the function that took
   the slot out of [procs_inv], and a dormant process parks
   [iref_slots (1 + IREFSPARE)] exactly as it parks [fd_slots FDSPARE].
   The [1] is the child's own cwd unit: while [np->cwd] is 0 the process
   holds the unit itself, and the [sd a0,336(s4)] is where it stops --
   spent on the reference [idup] creates, and parked in the itable against
   it from then on.  That bijection is what makes
   [IREFSLOTS = NPROC*(1 + IREFSPARE) + NFILE] literally true. *)

     parent's trapframe with a0 := 0, its address space, its size, its
     descriptor table, its working directory -- so a caller with a
     continuation for its child pays for exactly that continuation and for
     nothing else.  The record the child is actually parked at differs from
     it only in what the slot does not read ([UexecApply.uslot_key_cong]):
     allocproc's page-table root and trapframe page, the child's own
     descriptor pointers, ghost names and name bytes, and the KERNEL words
     of the trapframe.  So the park re-keys, and it may: kfork holds
     [FirstTok.first_done] below, so the child can never be resumed through
     forkret's boot arm and the park it reaches is the STEADY one
     ([ParkCap.park_token_park_steady]), whose closer resumes at a record
     with the parked run key ([UexecRet.urun_eq],
     [KforkChild.urun_eq_kfork_child]). *)
  (* THE CHILD'S GENERATION IS ∀-BOUND: allocproc mints a fresh one inside
     this call, so the CALLER cannot name it and undertakes to supply a
     slot at whichever one comes out; the child's children set is [∅] on
     the nose ([UexecRet.uexec_fork_child_F]). *)
  (* ...AND IT IS PAID UNDER THE CHILD'S OWN [my_pay]: the caller's slot
     may READ the payload its child's exit owes, because a verified child
     has to prove that exit.  kfork hands it over out of the split it
     makes ([ChildTok.gen_split]); a generic child ignores it. *)
  (* ...AND SO IS ITS PID, on exactly the generation's terms: <allocpid>
     chooses it inside this call, so the CALLER cannot name it either.  IT
     IS THE PID THE POST RETURNS: kfork parks the child at the number
     [kfork_post]'s success arm hands back as [pidv], so a parent holding
     [ChildTok.child_tok γ pidv Q] knows the pid its child's key is at --
     [ChildTok.gen_pid] reads it off the token -- and a verified parent can
     therefore say what its child's getpid(2) will answer. *)
  (* ...AND WHAT THE PARENT LENDS THE CHILD, A LINEAR PREMISE OF ITS OWN
     (lane FORK-REFUND).  It comes in BESIDE the slot rather than inside
     it, because kfork has to be able to give it back without building a
     child: on the two failure exits it drops the wand below and refunds
     this copy ([kfork_post]'s -1 arm), and on the success path it feeds
     this copy to the wand.  A caller that lends nothing passes [emp]. *)
  Rc -∗
  (* THE CHILD IS NOT <INIT> (lane TRAP-ROWS-4, B1b): <init>'s pid is the
     literal 1, permanently registered, and the pid scan inside allocproc
     is what refutes the candidate -- kfork holds [procs_avail None] and
     that is where the refutation comes from
     ([SpecAllocproc.allocproc_post]'s uncounted arm). *)

  (* ...AND HOW A KILLER PAYS FOR THE CHILD (lane SELF-KILL, §4b'; the
     owner's ruling of 2026-09-13).  A [kill(2)] costs the TARGET's exit
     payload at -1, and the party that calls kill holds none of the
     target's resources -- so the child's killed row
     ([SchedCtx.kill_paid]'s live arm) publishes this wand and a TAINTED
     killer cashes it with [RiscvPtsto.app_taint].  allocproc founds
     the row, so the FORKING process is the party that must supply the
     wand: a verified parent proves it on its payload's taint arm, and the
     generic slot's [Q] is [fun _ => True]. *)

     [FirstTok.first_tok_of_done] mints the child's token from, at the
     [sd a0,336(s4)] that closes the child's construction window. *)

   0x800033e8 (both call sites), dirlookup 0x8000377c, iput 0x8000335e.

   ---- WHAT IT SPEAKS IN ----------------------------------------------------

   THE LOOP CURRENCY IS [IcacheHeld.inode_held] -- the pointer-keyed,
   slot/fraction/inum-existential form that [ProcInv.cwd_ref] already is.  Both
   starting arms produce exactly that (iget's postcondition IS a reference at
   an existential fraction; idup's mint likewise), and both wrappers hand it
   straight on.  Nothing in namex's contract names a slot.

   THE PATH is a byte buffer at [a0] described by a naming function [pfun] and
   a length [plen] with [ByteBuf.bb_cstr pfun plen]; the MODEL is the byte list
   [pl := DirentEnc.bview plen pfun], and [PathElems.path_elems pl] is the list
   of elements the loop consumes.  namex reads indices 0..plen inclusive and
   never past the terminator, so [S plen] bytes of FULL ownership is (memmove reads the path as its
   source, and its contract demands DfracOwn 1 there -- N4c2 finding A)
   exactly right.

   THE NAME BUFFER is 14 caller-owned bytes at [a2], written by the two
   memmoves.  It comes back holding an UNSPECIFIED naming function [nf] --
   the short branch leaves bytes above [len] untouched -- and on the
   nameiparent success arm the one fact that matters,
   [DirentEnc.bname 14 nf = e], holds with [e] the LAST element
   ([PathElems.nameiparent_of]).  That clause is [PathElems.skipelem_name_view]
   and it covers BOTH memmove shapes, including the long branch's
   unterminated 14-byte copy.

   ---- SCOPE RULING: THE POSTCONDITION IS RESOURCE-SHAPED -------------------

   Success is [a0 = ip <> 0] with [inode_held ip]; failure is [a0 = 0] with
   every loaned resource back and NO inode resource retained.  There is NO
   path -> inode functional statement: each dirlookup is atomic under its own
   directory's lock and no stable global tree exists between iterations under
   concurrency, so the honest refinement would be a ghost trace ("there was a
   sequence of atomic lookups, each finding element i in the then-current
   contents of directory i-1"), which earns nothing at this altitude.  It is
   RECORDED as a future frontier beside DirView's [gmap name inum] view.  The
   name-buffer clause IS functional, because it is locally produced.

   ---- THE PREMISES -------------------------------------------------------

   (1) THE TWO icfg TIES ARE GONE (rank 1c): namex reads the device and the
       inode count off the class.  What N4a's [DirView.dir_ok_dir] wanted
       the second of them for is still here -- the [dir_ok icfg_nib dn data]
       conjunct now rides inside [IcacheEscrow.ic_loaded], so namex destructs
       dirlookup's [dir_inums_ok] premise straight out of ilock's
       postcondition at a directory it could not have named in advance.
       namex needs NO granularity fact (fs-icache.md §15(b)).

   (2) [dev = ROOTDEV] and [0 < nib].  The absolute arm's [li a1,1] /
       [mv a0,a1] is literally [iget(1, 1)], so the cache's device must BE
       ROOTDEV for that reference to be one this cache can hold, and iget's
       [bv_unsigned ROOTINO < 16 * nib] needs a non-empty inode region.

   (3) [SpecDirlink.ireg_blocks_ok inodestart nib fsc_cov fsc_logst] -- N3's
       finding 2, and it is exactly right here: ilock, iput and iunlockput all
       want [IBLOCK inum inodestart ∈ fsc_cov] (and iput its log-region
       complement) at inums namex learns only at run time, and a fact about
       the superblock LAYOUT discharges all of them.

   (4) THE BUDGET IS LINEAR IN THE ELEMENT COUNT.  Every turn of the loop
       spends at most one [iput_units] interval (the iunlockput at +0xdc, or
       the one at +0x82 / +0x54 that ends the walk), and the nameiparent-of-
       "/" arm spends one more at +0x136; ilock and dirlookup take no log
       reservation at all.  Hence [(L + 1) * iput_units <= n] in, with
       [L = length (path_elems pl)], and the matching spend-at-most interval
       out.  Partial correctness needs no measure; [PathElems.skipelem_decr]
       exists if one is ever wanted.

   (5) THE LEDGER IS TWO SLOTS IN.  The starting arm spends one (iget's mint,
       or idup's), and each turn peaks at one more (dirlookup's iget, returned
       by the following iunlockput).  Success returns ONE (the walk's own
       reference is still alive, in [inode_held]); every failure arm returns
       BOTH, which is the resource statement of "no inode resource retained".

   (6) The parking premise [eb = true] -- ilock, dirlookup and iput all sleep.

   THE WORKING DIRECTORY RIDES INSIDE THE PROCESS BLOCK.  [p->cwd] is one of
   [ProcDefs.proc_fields]' four cells, so [proc_priv_bare pj pidv Vpr] already
   owns it and already names its value: [pv_cwd Vpr].  namex BORROWS the cell
   out of the block ([ProcInv.proc_priv_bare_cwd]) for the one [ld a0,336(a0)]
   the relative arm performs, and hands it straight back -- the same shape
   acquiresleep uses for [p->pid].  An earlier version of this contract asked
   for [p_cwd pj ↦₈{dqc} cwdv] as a row of its own ALONGSIDE the block, which
   is the whole cell twice over, and so was uncallable.

   [inode_held (pv_cwd Vpr)] stays a row of its own: the reference the process
   holds on its working directory is fs-layer state, not a [struct proc] cell,
   and nothing in the block implies it.  It is taken UNCONDITIONALLY and handed
   back untouched even though only the relative arm reads the cwd -- a
   two-armed precondition keyed on the first path byte would buy nothing.

   NOTHING IN THIS CONTRACT DEPENDS ON THE CWD'S VALUE.  Neither arm of the
   post relates the inode it returns to the directory the walk started from
   (the only content claim is [nameiparent_of pl es e], about the path bytes),
   so [pv_cwd Vpr] is read, walked from, and never mentioned again.

   ---- THE PANIC ARMS ------------------------------------------------------

   All inherited, none new: ilock's "ilock: no type", iget's "iget: no
   inodes", dirlookup's "dirlookup not DIR" (refuted by the [lh a5,68(s4)]
   test namex performs at +0xbc) and its now-live "dirlookup read"
   granularity arm.  The panic credentials are threaded and nothing else is owed.

     It was here because the general walk reaches [iput], whose free path
     freezes an inode and must therefore exhibit the regime it freezes
     under (iclaim-ledger.md §3.2, RULING B).  THE ROOT CORNER NEVER REACHES

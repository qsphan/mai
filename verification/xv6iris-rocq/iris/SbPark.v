  (* A CHILD OF [FsBlocks.logN], AND THE SIBLING OF THE BYTE VIEW'S OWN
     [fsbN] (durable-disk lane E-blk1; the reasoning is written out at
     [FsBlocks.fsbN]).  Every FS-side byte accessor already carries
     [↑logN ⊆ E], so ONE premise now reaches both the byte view and block
     1's park -- which is what lets [log_write] refute a write at block 1
     inside its own atomic-update window, whose mask is the caller's [Efs]
     and about which its contract says only [↑logN ⊆ Efs].  Siblings and
     not nested: the commit holds the byte view open while the collection
     reads block 1. *)

  (* OPEN, READ, CLOSE.  Every conclusion the collection draws from block 1
     is read off the run while the invariant is open -- the parse is pure
     and the fraction is spent on nothing -- so the closing wand takes the

  (* NOBODY CAN OWN A RUN INSIDE BLOCK 1, and that is what makes "the log's
     write set never names block 1" a maintained row of [LogInv.log_state]
     rather than a premise on twenty call sites.  [SpecLogWrite]'s
     byte-range atomic update hands the callee the caller's window at
     FRACTION 1; the park holds the whole block at fraction 1; two full
     owners of one byte are inconsistent.

     Stated at [↑logN ⊆ E] and not at [↑sbN ⊆ E] because that is the mask
     premise [log_write]'s contract already carries -- see [sbN] above.
     [FsCollectImg.log_ctx_sb_not_owned] is the same refutation at a WHOLE

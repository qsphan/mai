(* FsDurBytes.v -- THE THEORY OF [LogDefs.fs_dbytes].

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-state.md sections 1 and 4; this
   is durable-disk 2c-img, leaf 1.

   [LogDefs.fs_dbytes] flattens a BLOCK view [D : gmap Z (list (bv 8))] into
   the BYTE map a durable instance's authority is held at: block [b]'s [i]th
   byte lives at [b * BSIZE + i].  What a durable instance needs is to look
   INSIDE it: that the byte elements at [fs_dbytes D] ARE the file system's
   per-block ownership, one [FsStateDefs.blk_owned] per entry of [D].  That
   is [fs_dbytes_blocks] below, stated Gamma-generically.

   THE ONE PREMISE IS A LENGTH BOUND, and it is what makes the flattening
   injective: two blocks' byte ranges are disjoint exactly because a block
   contributes at most [BSIZE] bytes starting at a multiple of [BSIZE]
   ([dbytes_seq_disj]).  Without it [fs_dbytes] is still defined -- the fold
   just overwrites -- and says nothing, so no lemma below holds unguarded.
   [map_fold]'s own insert equation ([map_fold_insert_L]) needs the same
   fact, since its commutation premise is [map_union_comm]'s.

   THERE IS NO [Gamma_D] RECORD ANY MORE (durable-disk lane CE, S2's arity
   sweep).  The pre-snapshot design instantiated [FsStateDefs]' view record
   at a fixed-layer byte-map gname and a two-gname bundle; the snapshot
   ruling made the durable half of [FsCrash.P_fs] a function of the
   committed map over its OWN existential names, and nothing read the
   instance.  What is left is the Gamma-GENERIC flattening theory, section 2.

   SECTION 3 IS THE DURABLE INSTANCE ITSELF, and it is not that record
   returning: [snap_gamma] is a function of ONE epoch's three existential
   gnames, which is exactly what the snapshot ruling left.  It lives here,
   at the bottom of the durable stack, because BOTH files above instantiate
   the flattening over it and NEITHER needs the other -- [FsDurXfer]
   allocates a fresh family, [FsDurRead] reads an existing one, and the
   three lines of the record were the whole of the edge between them.

   THIS IS ALSO THE ONLY PLACE THE RECORD CAN SIT WITHOUT TWO [ghost_map]
   CLASS PATHS IN SCOPE AT ONCE.  The logged instance's bridge
   ([FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L]) is stated over [fsLogG]'s byte map; put
   [diskImgG] beside it and [ghost_map_auth_frac (fs_bytes γfs) 1 Lb] resolves
   through the wrong class and no agreement law applies (the trap
   [FsDurSnap.fs_bytes_auth]'s section was written to dodge, durable-disk
   lane H).  Section 2 carries no [ghost_map] class at all, so section 3
   brings the first and only one. *)

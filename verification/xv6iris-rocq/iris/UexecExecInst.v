(* UexecExecInst.v -- THE KERNEL-SIDE INSTANCE of the per-syscall deposit
   class [UexecSG.uexecSG], and of the generic program's [UexecSG.uprogSG]
   beside it.

   UexecSG.v states the U-mode trap contract's returning arm over an
   ambient class whose family
   [sbundle : (uvis -d> iPropO Σ) -> Z -> uvis -> iProp Σ] says what the
   program hands over at an ecall of number [n], AT THE RECURSIVE
   OCCURRENCE: exec's bundle carries a slot wand, so the family is applied
   to the fixpoint variable and at the fixpoint it concludes at [uslot] --
   the slot the kernel returns for the new process.  The class is what
   keeps the whole U-mode fixpoint's cone clear of the fs tower.  THIS file
   is where the two meet.

   WHICH NUMBERS HAVE A BUNDLE.  Nine: read 5, exec 7, chdir 9, open 15,
   write 16, mknod 17, unlink 18, link 19, mkdir 20 -- every syscall with an
   AU contract.  Each branch is that contract's own landed INPUT, read off
   the key: the process's families, the image, the three argument words, the
   descriptor view and the working directory, and nothing else.  Every other
   number's [sbundle_at] is [emp].

   WHICH NUMBERS PAY A POST.  Eight: read 5, chdir 9, open 15, write 16,
   mknod 17, unlink 18, link 19, mkdir 20.  Six of them pay that contract's
   own armed post verbatim, read off the same key projections its input is;
   chdir and open pay their contract's RECEIPT ([SpecSysChdir.chdir_receipt],
   [SpecSysOpen.open_receipt]) -- the process-nameable half of the arms,
   whose kernel half ([ProcInv.proc_priv], the descriptor fragments,
   [FdSlots.fd_slot]) the dispatcher keeps.  exec 7 pays [emp], and alone:
   its bundle is consumed and its process never resumes on success.  Every
   number without a contract pays [emp] too.

   THE POST IS READ AT THE RESUME KEY, which is what makes the three
   receipts statable: read's whole effect on its caller is the bytes it put
   in the caller's buffer, which are entries of the image it resumes at
   ([M']); chdir's is the working directory it resumes at ([cw']) and
   open's is one row of the descriptor table it resumes at ([fdv']); none
   is a projection of the TRAP key.  So [UexecSG.spost_at] takes all three
   beside the returned a0, bound by the same [∀] of the arm that binds the
   four pure rows, and the receipts SHARPEN the rows
   [UsysMemOk.usys_mem_ok], [usys_cwd_ok] and [usys_fd_ok] state there:
   "the file's bytes from your offset" rather than "some byte function",
   "the directory you named" rather than "a failed chdir did not move", and
   "the console, at your omode" rather than "some slot became open".  The
   route back to the process is [SpecUsertrap.ut_sys_out] as a row of
   [usertrap_post], produced by the dispatcher's
   [SpecSyscall.sysc_sys_out].

   THE DEPOSIT'S FAMILIES ([UexecSG.sfam]) are a RECORD with one field per
   contracted syscall, so that the arm can bind them once in front of both
   legs and the post comes back at the receipts the process chose.  At this
   instance the record is [xfam]: exec's four, and the walk cursors, piece
   pairs, write's prefix cursor and console seed the other eight contracts
   take.  [xfam_exec] builds one at exec's four with every other field at
   the trivial family -- which is exactly what the two supply laws hand
   back, since those laws ARE [FsAbsInvFire]'s dischargers.

   THE DESCRIPTOR KEY IS [FdSlots.fd_st_of_key], NOT [sys_fd_st], and that
   is what makes read's and write's bundles statable here at all: [sys_fd_st]
   reads the process's [ofile] POINTER array, a kernel-side reading no
   process has.  [SpecArgfd.sys_fd_st_of_key] is the equation between the
   two and the DISPATCHER pays it, out of the fragment length,
   [ProcInv.proc_priv]'s length and [ProcInv.proc_priv_states_agree]
   ([ProofSyscall.sysc_fd_key]).

   NOTHING HERE READS A [CtxIdDefs.CurCtx], and that is a requirement rather
   than an accident (the section note below).  Getting there cost the dead
   context binders on [FsAbsDelta.delta_trunc],
   [SysOpenDefs.atrunc_commit_at] and the [om_*] mode readers,
   [SpecSysOpen.open_in] and [SpecSysMkdir.mkdir_au_at]/[mkdir_arms] --
   TSO-rebase appends that no body ever read.

   WHAT EXEC'S BUNDLE IS.  [SpecSysExec.sys_exec_au_pre] at the TRAPPING
   KEY's own data -- and open's and mknod's rows (15 and 17) read the same
   two, the image and argument 0, for the same reason: their walks are at
   the path THEIR argument 0 names ([ArgPath.arg_path_of]):
     - the image [uvis_M W]: the arguments are read off the image the
       process trapped at ([wp_sys_exec_sconf_body] takes the bundle at
       [us_M U], and the trap-out key's image IS that image -- the loop
       hands [uvis_M W] to the dispatcher);
     - the argv pointer [tf_w (uvis_tf W) (tf_arg_idx 1)]: sys_exec's
       argument 1, read off the key's trapframe.  ([wp_sys_exec_sconf_body]
       names it [v1] and pins it by [pv_tf (us_V U) !! tf_arg_idx 1 =
       Some v1]; [tf_w] is the total reader of the same word.)
     - the descriptor view [uvis_fd W] as [sts]: the table the NEW process
       starts with is the one the caller had, which is exactly the key's
       ([exec_slot_pre]'s [sts] rides straight into [exec_key U' sts na]).
   The ghost/logical parameters [P], [Pmiss], [Fo] and the slot piece's
   refund are EXISTENTIAL here: the U-mode contract cannot name the
   caller's era predicates, so the arm says only "some AU bundle at this
   key", and the dispatch route re-binds them when it consumes the bundle.

   THE KEY CONGRUENCE is [UexecSG.skey_eq]'s six rows: the bundle reads the
   image, argument word 1, the descriptor view and the working directory,
   and nothing else off its key.

   MONOTONICITY IN THE SLOT FAMILY is the one field whose proof is not a
   projection: the family occurs only as the CONCLUSION of the slot piece's
   two wands (one per success arm), so the upgrader walks in under
   [sys_exec_slot_pre]'s ∀s and [PieceFam.pf_at]'s [∧]-refund, twice.

   THE SUPPLY [ssupply] IS THE APPLICATION'S PREDICATE HELD OF EVERY VIEW
   ([AppInv.app_sup]).  That is the credential an UNVERIFIED program runs
   on: it is what makes a view-moving commit's [AppInv.app_step] free, and
   so what every syscall bundle with a write-kind commit is paid out of.
   Exec's own bundle needs none of it -- [FsAbsInvFire.fsabs_exec_half]
   hands back the walk premise and open's commit at [True] receipts as a
   closed fact, and a generic slot family answers the slot wand at every
   key -- which is why both supply laws below still ignore their argument.
   The supply is spelled here anyway, because it is what the OTHER numbers'
   bundles will be paid from when they are turned on, and because the
   credential has to exist before the dischargers can be re-based on it.
   That is also why this file sits ABOVE the fire tower rather than beside
   SpecSysExec.v: the supply law is a class field, and its exec case is
   [fsabs_exec_half].

   WHERE THE SUPPLY COMES FROM, AND WHY IT IS NOT PARKED.  It is founded
   by the GENERIC application alone, out of the triviality of its own
   predicate ([AppInv.app_sup_of_triv]), at the one place that needs it:
   its discharge of the system theorem's [Hinit_boot]
   ([SystemAdequacy.init_boot_of_sup]), which mints the generic slot on it.
   It cannot ride an era-owned resource -- see [AppInv]'s [app_sup_raw] --
   because a constraining application cannot found it, and it appears in no
   kernel contract for the same reason.

   [Γ] and [γfs] are NOT existential: the whole tree runs at the single
   ambient file system ([FsCfg.fsc_fs] with the derived view names
   [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L fsc_fs]), exactly as [wp_sys_exec_sconf_body]
   pins them. *)

     WHICH NUMBERS PAY A POST -- eight of them.  Each branch is that syscall's own landed armed
     post, read off the SAME key projections its input branch above is read
     off -- so what a process gets back is a statement about the very
     receipts, refunds and cursors it deposited:
       5   [SpecFileread.fileread_extra] at [FdSlots.fd_st_of_key], at the
           RESUME IMAGE [M'] and the buffer address argument 1 -- the
           receipt names the bytes read() put in the caller's buffer -- with
           [SpecFileread.fileread_ret] in front of it, the return value's
           range at the key's own count (lane CONS-ROWS, B3); and 16
           [SpecFilewrite.filewrite_extra] at the same key, with
           [filewrite_ret] in front of it for the same reason (lane
           NIL-RET: at a pipe or a read-only descriptor the arm is [emp],
           so the blanket is the only thing a U-tier writer learns about
           its answer).  The SYSCALL's own blankets ([SpecSysRead.sys_read_ret]
           / [SpecSysWrite]'s) stay behind either way: they read
           [pv_ofile V], a kernel array no process can name;
       17/18/19/20  the contract's arms verbatim ([mknod_arms] /
           [unlink_arms] / [link_arms] / [mkdir_arms]).
       9/15  the contract's RECEIPT ([SpecSysChdir.chdir_receipt],
           [SpecSysOpen.open_receipt]).  These two arms are the ones whose
           landed form bundles kernel resources -- [ProcInv.proc_priv] at
           the block the syscall wrote, the descriptor fragments and
           [FdSlots.fd_slot] -- so what comes back here is the arms' OTHER
           half: the walk cursor, the observed rows, the fired receipts, the
           trunc leg, and, in place of the resources, the pure fact about
           the key the process RESUMES at ([cw'] for chdir, one row of
           [fdv'] for open).  [SpecSysChdir.chdir_arms_split] and
           [SpecSysOpen.open_arms_split] are the ties, and the dispatcher
           keeps the kernel half.
     ONE PAYS [emp]:
       7   exec's bundle is CONSUMED and its process never resumes on
           success -- there is nothing to give back.
     Every number without a contract pays [emp] too.

     THE RESUME KEY'S THREE MOVING COMPONENTS, [M'], [fdv'] and [cw'], are
     arguments here for exactly the three receipts that read them: the
     bytes read() delivered are entries of the resume image, a descriptor
     is a row of the table the call returns to, and a working directory IS
     the field chdir wrote.  The other five branches ignore them, as does
     every contract-free number.

     THE SLOT FAMILY [X] DOES NOT OCCUR: a post is what comes back to the
     process that is RESUMING, so no branch concludes at the fixpoint
     variable the way exec's input bundle does.  That is what makes
     non-expansiveness a [reflexivity]. *)
  (* [cs'] is the RESUME KEY'S CHILDREN SET, beside [fdv'] and [cw'] and for
     their reason: a receipt may be about what the call left in the resume
     key, and wait(2)'s is about exactly that.  No entry's post reads it
     yet -- the eight below are file-system entries -- so every branch
     ignores it. *)

          to.  So what the process is told here is that SOME table
          projecting to its own key's permission map was the one the call
          ran on: the honest weak form, since the projection cannot see
          which pages are lazily unmapped ([UserPerm]'s note on
          [perm_fill], and [ProcPtOwn.perm_of_uptd_ext_sz] -- MAP-KEY is
          what would strengthen it).  The dispatcher supplies the
          process's own [pv_upt (us_V U)] and the equation holds by
          [UexecSlot.uvis_of]'s definition ([ProofSyscall.sysc_out_read]).

          can then refute the receipt's copyout-fault disjunct; at [true] it
          learns nothing new, which is the honest reading of a process that
          may have called sbrklazy.  Both come off the DISPATCHER's own
          block: well-formedness from [ProcPtOwn.proc_ptm], and the claim

  (* THE SUPPLY.  Opaque in the class, and at THIS instance it is the
     application's predicate held of EVERY view ([AppInv.app_sup]) -- the
     credential that makes a write-kind commit's [AppInv.app_step] free, and
     hence the one an unverified program's bundles are paid from.  Every
     branch of the two laws below is one [FsAbsInvFire] discharger at the
     trivial families, which is exactly the record [xfam_pt] names. *)
  (* ...AND SINCE lanes KILL-PAY (§1c) AND OUT-FUPD IT IS THE TRIPLE: the
     application's predicate at every view, the application's KILL
     CREDENTIAL, and the application's OUTPUT LICENCE.  The generic slot is
     what runs an UNVERIFIED program, and an unverified program may call
     kill(2), may trap with a cause the kernel cannot rule out -- both of
     which cost the credential ([xv6_sbundle]'s row 6,
     [UexecRet.uexec_ret_F]'s non-ecall arm) -- and may [write(2)] on the
     CONSOLE, which since lane OUT-FUPD costs the licence: the console
     UART's invariant carries the application's own claim about the bytes
     it has accepted ([RiscvPtsto.riscv_cons_res]), so putting a byte out is
     no longer free.  All three are bought by the application at the SAME
     place ([App.al_kill] and [App.al_sup]: the supply buys both),
     so bundling them here charges an application nothing it was not
     already paying, and keeps every verified program -- whose slot is at
     [uprogSG_free] and touches none of the three -- free.  The licence is
     LAST. *)
  (* ...AND THEN IT WAS A TRIPLE (redesign R4).  Lane CONS-IO made it a
     quadruple because the port carried TWO claims and so needed two
     licences -- one for [write(2)] and one for consoleintr's shift and
     [read(2)] on fd 0.  There is ONE claim ([RiscvPtsto.riscv_cons_res])
     and therefore ONE law over it ([WpUart.cons_licence]), which the
     application prices once. *)
  (* ...AND IT IS BACK TO THE PAIR (lane SUP-ONE, survey R1).  The
     LICENCE is not a credential any more: the application's kill price
     buys it outright ([RiscvPtsto.app_iface]'s [ai_lic], read here as
     [WpUart.cons_licence_of_taint]), so what the generic slot carries is
     the application's claim at every view and the application's TAINT,
     and every generic-tier signature below lost its [cons_licence]
     argument.  THE PAIR DOES NOT COLLAPSE FURTHER -- see the lane's
     findings: [app_sup] lives on [AppCfg.appcfg] (through
     [FileInvDefs.file_app]) and the taint on [RiscvPtsto.app_iface]
     (through [riscvFixedGS]), and the equation that ties the two records
     is a PREMISE of each boot obligation, ambient nowhere. *)

     [emp].  Every other branch is a closed fact or a wand off the supply. *)
  (* AT THE PAYLOAD THE CALLER NAMES (app-echo.md, "SH-LINE RULING", R1).
     The point re-keyed at [Q] ([xfam_at]) is the witness: every branch but
     read's ignores the payload, and read's -- the console arm -- is
     payable out of the persistent credential at ANY [P]
     ([FsAbsInvFire.fsabs_fileread_in]), because what it owes back is
     [∀ cur dc, |==> P ∗ True] and a [∀] over a constant IS that constant.
     Nothing is duplicated: the caller gets its [P] back at the ONE

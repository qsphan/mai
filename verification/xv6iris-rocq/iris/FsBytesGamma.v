(* FsBytesGamma.v -- THE ONE BRIDGE between the block layer's concrete byte
   map and the abstract view record every stage-2 file-system predicate is
   stated over.

   [FsStateDefs.fs_view_names] is a record whose only disk-facing field is
   [fsΦ], an ABSTRACT byte-address-keyed points-to (fs-state.md section 1).
   The file system is instantiated twice over it; this file supplies the
   LOGGED instance's [fsΦ], namely the FULL element of the era's byte view
   [FsBlocks.fs_bytes] --

     fsΦ (fs_gamma_L γfs) dq a v  :=  a ↪[fs_bytes γfs]{dq} v

   THE SHARE IS THE ERA'S OWN (durable-fs-plan.md sections 4 and 6, lane
   B'): the logged view is the ONE instance a read-locker takes a fraction
   of, so this is where [FsStateDefs.phi_frac] gets its witness.  The
   durable instances stay at [DfracOwn 1] and never split.

   -- together with the two properties of it that consumers need and cannot
   prove of an abstract predicate ([phi_excl], [GTimeless]), and the two
   equations that identify the abstract runs with the concrete ones.

   THE EQUATIONS HOLD BY CONVERSION, NOT BY NAME.  [FsStateDefs.byte_range]
   multiplies by [BioDefs.BSIZE_z], [FsBlocks.byte_range] by [FsBlocks.BSZ];
   both delta-reduce to 1024, so the two runs are convertible and the
   lemmas below are [reflexivity].  A [rewrite] between the two spellings
   will NOT fire (fs-state.md section 7, last bullet), which is exactly why
   these are stated once, here, and never re-derived at a use site.

   THE LINK AND TOP GNAMES COME OUT OF [fs_names] (durable-disk 2b-A / B3).
   [fs_gamma_L] reads [FsBlocks.fs_link] and [FsBlocks.fs_top], the two
   fields [FsBoot.fs_boot_ghosts] allocates for the era; there is no
   placeholder left.  Nothing stated over the byte view ALONE reads them --
   [FsStateBitmap.free_bitmap_at], which is the whole of the bitmap's
   in-memory owner, does not, and [free_bitmap_at_gname] is that fact -- so
   the bitmap's predicate is unchanged by their arrival. *)

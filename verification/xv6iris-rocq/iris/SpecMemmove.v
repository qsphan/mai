(* SpecMemmove.v -- the general whole-function spec of the kernel's [memmove]:
   copy [len] bytes from [p_src] to [p_dst].

   NON-OVERLAPPING ranges only, and that restriction is carried by SEPARATION,
   not by a pure side condition: the precondition owns the source bytes and the
   destination bytes as two separate conjuncts, which already says the two
   ranges are disjoint (a byte owned OUTRIGHT cannot also be owned at any dfrac
   as part of the other buffer -- and the DESTINATION is the whole side, since
   memmove writes it).  The proof turns that ownership back into the pure
   non-aliasing fact where it is needed, so a caller never has to state an
   address-arithmetic disjointness hypothesis -- it just hands over the two
   buffers it owns.

   Why the restriction is the right contract: the source's overlap test is
   [src < dst && src + n > dst], and only its true branch runs the descending
   copy loop (memmove+0x3e..+0x5e).  Under the separated precondition that test
   can never be true, so the whole descending loop is unreachable and the spec
   is the plain forward copy.  Every xv6 kernel caller copies between distinct
   objects, so nothing needs the overlapping contract; a caller that did would
   need a genuinely different spec (a byte-list permutation over ONE buffer),
   not a weakening of this one.

   Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof file --
   so every function proof can be checked in parallel. *)

(* memmove(dst, src, len): copies [len] bytes from [src] to [dst] and returns
   [dst] in a0.  As with memset, [len] need only fit in 32 bits (the C source
   truncates the count to [unsigned int] via an slli/srli round-trip), len = 0
   is allowed (the source's [n == 0] test skips the loop), and the buffers are
   indexed by [pa_add], which wraps the 64-bit address space exactly as the
   hardware's pointer increment does.  memmove saves ra/s0 in a 2-slot frame,
   so it needs 2 of the [n] available stack slots and returns them (avail [n]
   preserved). *)
(* THE TWO BUFFERS CARRY THEIR OWN TIERS.  [kts] is the SOURCE's, [ktw] the
   DESTINATION's, each below the accessing hart's regime [kt] -- the same
   two-tier shape [WpSconfMem]'s merged leaves have, and it is FORCED: copyin
   moves a KT0 page window into the caller's frame buffer (which rides [kt]),
   copyout moves the other way, and either_copy's kernel arm has both at
   [kt].  One shared datum tier cannot state any of those.  Both tiers are
   EXPLICIT: eager [KtierLe] refl would otherwise silently re-derive them as
   [kt] and every page caller would fail at its give-back. *) 
(* THE SOURCE RIDES THE CALLER'S FRACTION [dqs]; THE DESTINATION STAYS WHOLE.
   That is the tree-wide rule -- a byte run the callee only READS takes the
   caller's dfrac, a run it WRITES stays at [DfracOwn 1] -- and memmove is the
   place it is most visibly right: the forward copy loads from the source and
   stores to the destination, and nothing in the body needs the source to be
   exclusive.  The consumer is kexec by way of copyout: forkret's
   [kexec("/init", (char *[]){"/init", 0})] hands the SAME .rodata literal in
   as the path and as argv[0], and one byte run cannot be owned twice at full
   ownership.
     The non-aliasing argument the header above describes survives the
   relaxation, but it changes hands: it used to come from the SOURCE run's
   exclusivity ([RiscvPtsto.mem_bytes_notin]), and now comes from the
   DESTINATION byte's ([RiscvPtsto.mem_bytes_notin_r], the mirror image).
   Separation still carries the disjointness; only the whole side moved. *)

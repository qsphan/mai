(* FsAbsCreateFire.v -- CREATE'S LEGS AS COMMITS AND FIRES (round E2, lane
   E2-C), and the authority-shaped commits of the create family, moved down
   here from FsAbsMknodFire.v so that [SpecCreate]'s bundle can name them.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/applications.md section 2 (the
   three mover forms), claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md section 4
   (the legs), claude-notes/projects/app-round-e2.md sections 2(b)/3/5.

   ==== WHAT MOVES HERE ================================================

   The kernel performs [delta_create] as LEGS, one retag each:

     the ARM     ialloc's claim box gets [ip->nlink = 1; iupdate] -- the
                 child's row APPEARS at content [c], count 1 ([delta_arm]);
     the DOTS    mkdir's two interior [dirlink]s -- the child's row moves
                 from [ADir ∅] to a directory holding its dots
                 ([delta_dots], or [delta_dot] when the [".."] fell short);
     the PARENT  [dirlink(dp, name, ip->inum)] and mkdir's [dp->nlink++] --
                 [acre_commit_at]'s fused [delta_create], which at an ARMED
                 child IS the parent's one-row insert
                 ([FsAbsDelta.delta_create_armed]);
     the UNARM   the failure arm's [ip->nlink = 0] -- the row DISAPPEARS
                 ([delta_unarm]).  Ruling Q-h: a failed create is the
                 honest do-then-undo PAIR, arm then unarm, each an instant a
                 concurrent [ilock] can observe.

   Each leg is a two-phase commit in [acre_commit_at]'s mold (phase 1 hands
   the caller's step back beside the kernel's half of the authority; phase 2
   is quantified over the POST map and constrained by its reading), and
   each fires INSIDE the mover's [ftopN] critical section -- for the child
   under the ARMED registry ([InodeRegion.ireg_armed]), which is what
   exempts the half-built directory from [ftop_body]'s [inode_local] row
   between its count landing and its dots.

   ==== THE CHILD'S CONTENT IS TYPE-INDEXED ============================

   [cre_c0 tyz ma mi] is the row content the arm writes (an empty file, an
   empty directory, a device at the two halfwords); [cre_child tyz ma mi d i]
   the content the parent leg reads -- for a directory the dots are in, and
   they NAME THE TWO INUMS, which is why [acre_commit_at_gen] takes the
   content as a function of (parent, child) and [acre_commit_at c] is its
   constant instance.  A TYPE-PINNED CALLER holds the constant form and
   [SpecCreate.cre_commits_of_dev] / [cre_commits_of_file] move it to the
   function; a directory child needs the function itself.

   ==== THE DOTS COMMIT IS INDEXED BY WHAT LANDED =======================

   mkdir's [dirlink(ip, "..", dp->inum)] can fall short after the ["."]
   went in whole (ProofCreateMkdir's FAIL ENTRY 2); the child's row then
   moves ONCE, to a directory holding only ["."], and the failure arm
   unarms it.  [adots_commit_at] fires at either reading -- [full = true]
   for both dots, [full = false] for the first alone -- and its receipt
   says which ([FsAbsDelta.dots_delta], [dots_ents]).

     constrained by its READING alone -- so the client still witnesses
     exactly "the delta was applied" and nothing about the record the
     mover chose. *)
  (* THE CREATE'S CHILD IS THE ARMED INODE, and the leg now says so: it
     takes [cre_arm_fired Farm i], exactly as [aunarm_of_arm] below does.

     THE ARM'S RECEIPT IS A PERMIT, SPENT BY WHICHEVER LEG ENDS THE
     INODE.  The child's two legs -- the create and the unarm -- are the
     two ways one armed inode can end, and they are EXCLUSIVE on every
     run: the unarm fires only when [dirlink] failed, which is when the
     create commit did not.  That exclusion used to be a property of the
     RUN and of nothing in the logic, and a constraining application could
     not use it: a step at either leg needs the same exclusion credential
     (an exclusive token -- the echo application's [AppEcho.cons_key],
     which is what makes "the console is not there yet" a fact rather than
     an arm), and an exclusive resource can sit in only ONE of two
     [∗]-joined pieces, so whichever leg did not get it was unprovable.

     Taking the arm's receipt HERE and in [aunarm_of_arm], and CONSUMING it
     in both, makes the exclusion structural: the kernel holds one permit
     per armed inode and can fire at most one of the two legs with it.  The
     application parks its credential in [Farm]'s receipt and gets it back
     through the receipt of the leg that actually fired ([Φ] here,
     [cre_unarm_fired] there) -- nothing is lost, it moves.  The kernel
     pays nothing: every fire site already holds the arm's receipt at the
     instant it fires the parent leg (the arm ran at [ialloc], the create
     at [dirlink]), and the generic supplier drops it. *)
  (* THE PARENT CURSOR IS A PREMISE (lane TL-3K, design/user-tree.md
     section 7.5's WALL A, fix (i)).  [d] is quantified INSIDE this
     definition, so without [Pd] a supplier owes a step at EVERY directory
     of every view -- including one inside a STRANGER's subtree, where a
     constraining application has no step at all and cannot tell that case
     from the free one ([TreeMove.v] section 4).  [Pd] is the walk's
     TERMINAL CURSOR, i.e. [P (length (npar_elems pl))] at the syscall
     altitude: nameiparent has already run when this leg fires, so the
     prover HOLDS it (it is what the ret-0 arm hands back --
     [SpecCreate.cre_ok_arms], [SpecSysMknod], [SpecSysUnlink]), and the
     kernel side of the change is a restatement.

     IT IS READ, NOT SPENT: phase 1 hands [Pd d] straight back, because the
     cursor is also the syscall's own post and the caller's [P] is an
     arbitrary (possibly linear) predicate the kernel may not duplicate.
     A supplier that does not care instantiates [Pd] at anything and

(* SpecMain.v -- the public interface of main() (kernel/main.c), the function
   every hart enters from [start()] in Supervisor mode and never leaves.

     volatile static int started = 0;
     void main() {
       if (cpuid() == 0) {
         consoleinit(); printkinit();
         printk("\n"); printk("xv6 kernel is booting\n"); printk("\n");
         kinit(); kvminit(); kvminithart(); procinit();

         started = 1;
       } else {
         while (started == 0) ;
         __atomic_thread_fence(__ATOMIC_SEQ_CST);
         printk("hart %d starting\n", cpuid());
         kvminithart(); trapinithart(); plicinithart();
       }
       scheduler();
     }

   DIVERGING, like scheduler's: main's two arms join at [jal scheduler]
   (main+0x3e) and scheduler never returns, so this spec has NO continuation --
   the conclusion is a bare [WP Loop {{Φ}}].  [tools/proof_coverage.py] reads
   the shape off the entry [pc_is] plus a continuation that leaves the
   function; here the exit is the callee's entry symbol, exactly as in
   SpecEntry.v.

   THIS FILE STATES THE BOOT-HART CONTRACT ONLY ([fin_to_nat cpu_id = 0]), but
   nothing in the TRANSLATION story blocks the secondary contract any more.
   The KERNEL PAGE TABLE is shared: main's boot arm publishes it as
   [KptShare.kpt_inv] and every hart's Sv39 translation runs on the per-hart
   residue [tlb_res_pt], so the table rides to the secondaries in [P] below.
   And the PRE-SWITCH phase is now per-hart too (claude-notes/projects/
   bare-inv-generic.md): [SRegime.bare_inv] holds only this hart's satp/PMP
   cells -- the globally unique [kmap_auth kmap_M0] moved OUT of it, into
   this precondition as a boot token spent in main's own publication
   assembly, before the kvminithart call -- so every hart can spin on
   [started] in its own Bare arm at once.
   [SchedCtx.procs_inv] is no longer an obstacle: since proc contexts became
   MIGRATABLE (claude-notes/completed/sched-hart-generic.md) it mentions
   neither a hart nor a per-hart SIE ghost, it is persistent, and it is
   exactly what the [started] payload can carry to every secondary.

   THE DEVICES.  The three device invariants ([WpUart.uart_inv Uart0] /
   [plic_inv] / [disk_inv], bundled as [dev_inv]) exist FROM TIME 0: they are
   allocated in adequacy, before any thread runs.  They have to be -- the UART,
   disk and PLIC threads are top-level threads of the system and each needs its
   device fragment at EVERY step (a UART rx byte can arrive at step 0; the disk
   thread must refute [DevStepDiskWild] at every step; the PLIC gateway latches
   whenever an irq line is up), so no device fragment can ever sit raw in a
   CPU's precondition.  main is therefore HANDED the bundle rather than
   allocating it, and what it is handed alongside is the boot hart's TOKENS:
   the exclusive transmitter [uart_tx_own γd l0] with its receipt and out-list
   lower bound at the same [l0], the UNFROZEN DLAB half (uartinit performs the
   divisor-latch dance and freezes the half at its final LCR write), and the
   virtio config tracker's half at a not-live [c0] (virtio_disk_init programs
   the queue under the invariant and keeps deterministic knowledge of the
   configuration through this half).  See claude-notes/projects/main-boot.md G1.

   THE HANDOVER.  Everything the boot hart's initialisation gives the other
   harts crosses ONE channel, the invariant on [started]
   ([StartedInv.started_inv]): a one-shot escrow [∃ v, started ↦₄ v ∗
   (⌜v = 0⌝ ∨ P)] whose payload must be PERSISTENT, because up to [NCPU - 1]
   harts read the flag and each wants the payload.  main's boot arm is the
   only writer, and paying [P] in is what its [sw a5,778(a4)] costs.

   [P] IS PAID OUT OF WHAT MAIN BUILT.  It rides as a parameter with
   [Persistent P], but the boot hart is not handed it -- it is handed a WAND
   and applies it at the [started = 1] store.  Its arguments are exactly the
   persistent facts whose GHOST NAMES main chooses: [γpr] when it allocates the
   [pr] lock out of printkinit's output (pr.lock protects the transmitter token
   -- SpecPrintk.v), [γs] when it allocates the 64 proc locks out of
   procinit's ([SpecProcinit.procs_inv_alloc]), and [γk] when it allocates the
   vdisk_lock over [DiskInv.disk_res] out of virtio_disk_init's
   ([DiskBoot.disk_res_boot]) -- the disk's PAGES (its configuration identity)
   are chosen by kalloc inside virtio_disk_init, so [pd pav pu] are quantified
   here too, and the persistent [DiskInv.disk_geom] that names them travels
   alongside the lock.

   ... and, out of MAIN'S OWN PUBLICATION ASSEMBLY -- the one-way door it
   runs between kvminit and kvminithart -- THE KERNEL PAGE TABLE: the shared
   invariant [KptShare.kpt_inv root] it allocates out of kvminit's exclusive
   tree and the [kpt_unset] one-shot, the root cell it PERSISTS after
   kvminit wrote it ([kernel_pagetable ↦₈□ root_b]), and the 65 mapping
   claims it mints out of [kmap_auth kmap_M0] (trampoline + the 64 kernel
   stacks).  None of it comes from kvminithart's post any more.  The root
   and the kstack pas are kalloc-chosen inside kvminit, so [root] and [pas]
   are quantified in the wand exactly as the disk's pages are.  All of it is
   persistent, which is what lets it ride the one-shot escrow to every
   secondary -- a secondary's own kvminithart needs no exclusive tree, only
   [kpt_inv] and the root cell.

   Everything else a secondary hart wants is either already persistent in
   main's own precondition (the device bundle) or, per G5, not statable yet.
   main's proof therefore never has to know what the secondaries want.

   THE INTERRUPT QUARTER.  [IntrDefs]'s SIE choreography splits the live-bit
   ghost 1/2 (tied in [sconf]) + 1/8 (the capability's arm) + 1/8 (the
   push/pop count) + 1/4 (the INVARIANT's).  The invariant is
   [IntrDefs.intr_inv], and main is the only code that ever allocates it
   ([intr_inv_alloc_off], from trapinithart's [stvec ↦ᵣ kernelvec]) -- so the
   spare quarter has to sit raw in main's precondition until then.  That is the
   [ghost_var_frac γ (1/4) ('b"0")] conjunct below; before the allocation nothing
   holds an interrupt handler, hence the '0'.

   THE CONTEXT SLOT is [SchedCtx.cpu_ctx_free], not an opaque [C]: nothing on
   the boot path parks anything in [cpus[0].context], and [scheduler] at the
   far end consumes [cpu_own γ 0 false p0 cpu_ctx_free] at exactly that shape.

       and gives [IcacheRefDefs.icfg] / [FsCfg.fscfg] their VALUES; this row is
       its whole output -- ten configuration ties plus the two boot kits --
       threaded here unopened.  Main spends kit 1 between +0x8e and +0xa2
       ([bio_init_at], [icache_boot_at], the [newlock_at]s) and carries kit 2
       to the userinit call, where stage (f) will deposit it into
       [FirstTok.first_tok]'s widened left disjunct for forkret's fsinit.

       Stated at [file_icfg]/[file_fscfg] -- the AMBIENT class's own two
       projections -- so that every row is at the instance the boot chain is
       applied at, which is the same discipline
       [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc]'s return uses. *)

       [FsCrash.fs_crash_seam] does NOT and CANNOT: it relates the FIXED
       ghost layer's [riscv_crash_pred] field to [FsCrash.P_fs], and the
       per-era boot obligation is quantified over an arbitrary fixed layer,
       so no fupd inside an era can mint it.  It is a premise of
       [SystemAdequacy.xv6_boot_era] instead, discharged there off

    (* ==================== THE SECOND PORT (bump 163d39b) ==================
       Everything main needs about UART1, all of it minted in
       [BootShared.boot_shared_alloc] and none of it derivable below the
       boot chain.

       [uart_inv Uart1 γd1] and [plic_inv γd γd1] are the two persistent
       invariants; [dev_inv]'s own PLIC conjunct ∃-packs the second port's
       names (which is what keeps [dev_inv] arity 2, ~140 specs naming it),
       so the CONCRETE one has to arrive separately.  With [uarts_pinned]
       and the [uart_inited γd1] main's own second deposit mints, they are
       exactly [SpecDevintr.uart1_caps γd] -- the row [devintr_caps] gained
       because the [irq == UART1_IRQ] arm runs the same uartintr at Uart1,
       and the row [SpecMainSecondary.main_deposit] has to carry for the
       harts that make none of it themselves.

       The four `.data` WORDS are the VA-tier snapshots of [uarts[i].base]
       and [uarts[i].rx]: [uartinit] relays them to [uartinitone], consputc
       loads [base] at Uart0 (through [SpecConsoleintr.console_caps]) and
       prputc at Uart1.  Their PHYSICAL twin is [uarts_pinned]; the crossing
       between the tiers is boot's, because a VA-tier points-to carries the
       mapping claim inside it.

       The port's own ghost row is the console's, verbatim: [uartinitone] is
       ONE contract run at two ports, so port 1 needs the transmitter token,
       the transmitted-prefix bound, the receipt, the receive token (the FCR
       clear empties that FIFO too) and the UNFROZEN DLAB half.  What port 1
       does NOT owe is any claim about the bytes -- its output is
       unconstrained -- so main drops the trace rows it gets back.

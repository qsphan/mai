(* PipeInvDefs.v -- [struct pipe] (kernel/pipe.c): its geometry, the two-ended
   reference algebra, the resource [pi->lock] protects, and the well-formedness
   predicate [is_pipe].

     #define PIPESIZE 512
     struct pipe { struct spinlock lock; char data[PIPESIZE];
                   uint nread; uint nwrite; int readopen; int writeopen; };

   A pipe is one kalloc'd page holding a single self-contained object, so --
   unlike the ftable, whose slots live in a global array under one global lock
   -- EVERYTHING about it is protected by its OWN lock, and there is no
   lock-free immutable part at all: no field of a [struct pipe] is ever read
   without holding [pi->lock].  So the predicate is exactly what the shape of
   the C code says it should be:

     is_pipe γl γp pi  :=  ⌜page_valid pi⌝ ∗
                           inv lockN (lock_inv γl pi "pipe" (pipe_res_at γp pi)
                                      ∨ pipe_dead γl γp)

   persistent, and [pipe_res] owns every remaining byte of the page -- the
   lock's own name field included, since kfree memsets all 4096.  The lock's
   invariant has a DEAD arm because a pipe's page goes back to kfree: once
   both ends are home the invariant degenerates into [pipe_dead], a husk
   nobody can open again, and the right to touch [pi->lock] at all is a
   resource -- a reference to the pipe, or the lock itself (see below).

   ---- the reference count ----

   xv6 does not give a pipe an int refcount; it gives it TWO int flags,
   [readopen] and [writeopen], one per end, and pipeclose(pi, writable) clears
   the one its argument selects and frees the page when both have reached 0.
   The count of outstanding references IS [readopen + writeopen], so the ghost
   mirrors the ends rather than a single number: per end, a FRACTION ghost

     pipe_ref γp w q  :=  own (pn_end γp w) q
                       -- q of the [w] end of pi ([w] = the struct file's
                          [writable] flag, i.e. pipeclose's second argument)

   with the invariant holding, per end ([pipe_endstate]), either "the flag is
   nonzero" or "the flag is zero AND the whole fraction has come home".  Three
   things fall out, and they are the whole reason for the shape:

   * a holder of ANY positive fraction of an end proves that end's flag is
     nonzero -- otherwise the invariant would hold fraction 1 of it as well;
   * only a holder of the FULL fraction of an end can close it, so an end
     cannot be closed twice, and a file that was [dup]ed cannot close the pipe
     out from under its twin;
   * the closer of the second end recovers fraction 1 of BOTH ends, which is
     the licence to reclaim the page.

   A single counter would not do any of this: it could not tell pipeclose(pi,1)
   twice apart from one close of each end.

   ---- the dead arm, and who may open the lock ----

   The licence to open [pi->lock] is deliberately NOT one resource but two:

     a REFERENCE  refutes [pipe_dead], so acquire may take the lock;
     the LOCK     refutes [pipe_dead], so release may put it down.

   [pipe_dead γl γp] parks BOTH ends at fraction 1 (so any [pipe_ref] is
   inconsistent with it) together with the lock's own state fragment
   [lock_frag γl None] (so any [locked]/[locked_pre] token is too).  The second
   credential is not redundant: by the time the closer of an end calls
   release, its reference has already gone home into [pipe_res], which release
   must be handed INTACT -- so release opens the lock on the strength of the
   lock token it is already carrying.  WpLock's [lock_openable] quantifies the
   credential inside the accessor precisely so the two can coexist
   ([is_pipe_openable] below, via [lock_openable_of_dead]).

   A CANCELLABLE invariant ([cinv]) with its token split across the references
   was the first design and cannot work: [cinv_acc] demands a share of the very
   token that must be WHOLE to cancel, and the first end to close has
   surrendered its share before its own release call, which opens the lock
   four times.  The fraction arithmetic has no solution -- the derivation is in
   claude-notes/design/pipe.md, "Killing the pipe: why not cinv".

   ---- the receipt ----

   [pipe_res] hides its flag words behind existentials, so inside release's
   finisher the last closer cannot re-read them to show both ends are home.
   It carries witnesses instead: [pipe_endstate]'s open side holds an
   exclusive per-end marker ([pipe_openmark], a [DfracOwn 1]), and closing an
   end DISCARDS it, yielding the persistent [pipe_shut].  So an end can never
   re-open (which is what makes [pipe_dead] stable), and the closed side keeps
   a copy of [pipe_shut] that the OTHER closer picks up when it reads that
   flag as 0.  [pipe_res_dead] is the whole argument in one lemma: two receipts
   plus the spent [lock_frag γl None] turn [pipe_res] into
   [pipe_dead ∗ pipe_bytes] -- exactly the wand RELEASE_CANCEL asks for.

   ---- the page, and reclaiming it ----

   [pipe_res] holds the data buffer, the four counter/flag words, AND every
   byte of the page that [struct pipe] does not name (the 4 padding bytes
   inside [struct spinlock], and everything past its 552-byte extent) -- see
   [pipe_slack].  Nothing ever reads those; they are held only so that the
   page can be handed back to kfree, which memsets all 4096 bytes.

   The lock's NAME field is [pipe_res]'s too, held raw rather than sealed into
   a persistent [lock_name]: it is 8 bytes inside the page, and kfree memsets
   all of them.  Nothing reads it, so nothing loses by that.

   ---- why this is its own file ----

   This is the slice of PipeInv.v every HOLDER of a pipe reference needs
   ([FileInvDefs]' [file_core], and every whole-function proof that only
   reads/writes through an existing pipe): the geometry, the reference
   algebra, and [is_pipe]/[pipe_held].  PipeInv.v itself keeps the page-carving
   and construction lemmas ([pipe_raw], [page_own_pipe_raw], [new_pipe], ...),
   needed only by pipealloc/pipeclose/piperead/pipewrite's own proofs -- not by
   anything that merely requires a pipe to already exist and be well-formed.
   Splitting them out lets that construction machinery compile IN PARALLEL
   with FileInv/ProcInv/SchedCtx/SpecPiperead/ProofPiperead instead of sitting
   as a serial prerequisite of all of them (it was ~99s on the critical path
   for content none of those five files touch).  See claude-notes/optimization.md.

     THIS IS NOT WHAT [FileInvDefs.file_core] USES, and the reason is the
     caveat this comment used to record as future work: two shares of one
     address cannot be RECOMBINED without knowing they name the same [γp], and
     recombining them is exactly what the last fileclose does when it takes
     [file_rest]'s parked fraction back.  FileInv pins the identity instead --
     a per-slot frac-times-agree names field, split by the same fractions as
     the content cells -- and [file_payload] is stated at the NAMED [γp].
     [pipe_held] is kept as the address-keyed form for anything that only ever
     needs to SPLIT (nothing does today). *)
  Definition pipe_held (pi : mword 64) (w : bool) (q : Qp) : iProp Σ :=
    (∃ (γl : gname) (γp : pipe_names), is_pipe γl γp pi ∗ pipe_ref γp w q)%I.
End PipeInv.

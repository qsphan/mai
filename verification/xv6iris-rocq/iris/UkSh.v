  (* ...AND THE SAME STUB WITH THE SOURCE RUN IN THE TEXT HALF (lane
     TXT-ROW's leaf, at sh; [UkEcho.wp_kecho_write_chain_txt] is the twin).

     EVERY LITERAL SH WRITES IS .rodata: the prompt "$ " at 0x1338, the
     three panic strings, the two "%s" formats.  A .rodata run is filed
     under [UkRun.ukn_t] and its pages are X-and-NOT-W, so
     [UserHeap.uheap_ubytes_w] -- which is what [wp_ksh_write_chain] hands
     the leaf -- says nothing about it and the post's SHORT arm cannot be
     refuted.  [UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_write_chain_txt] reads the run off
     [UserHeap.uheap_text] instead, one test weaker and true of exactly
     the pages a literal lives on, and hands back the two facts
     [UkWriteLeaf.uwrite_no_short] wants.

     BOTH STUBS STAND, as [wp_ksh_write] and [wp_ksh_write_chain] do: a
     write whose buffer is the LINE BUFFER (the child's diagnostic prints
     a heap string) takes the data-half leaf, and a write whose buffer is

  (* WHAT A READ ANSWERS, at three arms and not one (lane SH-LINE 2b).
     Which arm the caller gets is not its choice.

       THE WINDOW.  The [dd] bytes the call delivered are the ring's
       committed sequence at [n .. n+dd), in order ([cons_window] over
       [cons_chain]'s bound), each with the application's tag on the
       history it arrived at; and the position comes back at [n + dc],
       where the extra step is ACCOUNTED FOR rather than merely bounded
       ([UserConsole.ucons_swallow] at [False] -- the copy-out fault is
       eliminated inside the discharge, so what is left is [C('D')] with
       nothing delivered).  THE TWO CONTROL-FLOW ROWS (lane CONS-ROWS,
       B1/B4) are what a ONE-BYTE reader spends: at [dd = cap] the cursor
       moved by exactly [dd], so nothing is missing behind the call; at
       [dd = 0] against a positive request the byte WAS popped, which
       refutes [ucons_swallow]'s left arm and sends the caller to the
       reason on the right.  [Z.of_nat dd = bv_unsigned r] is what turns
       the [blez] the caller ran into either of those two cases.

       THE MINUS ONE.  consoleread answers -1 only when the process was
       killed, and a shut fd 0 answers -1 without reaching consoleread at
       all ([SpecFileread.fileread_extra_core]'s [FdClosed] arm, lane
       CLOSED-READ).  Neither pays a window; the token comes back
       somewhere.  It is not a placeholder: [gets] breaks on [cc < 1].

       THE TAINT.  A read taken WITHOUT the reader token moved the ring's
       committed count without moving the cursor, and the kernel cannot
       keep such a reader out ([ConsoleInv]'s "CONS-CURSOR RULING (7)").
       What it leaves is the dirty credential, which for a constraining
       application IS [T], and sh's continuation goes generic. *)

     three readings of it, all in [wp_kshg_loop] (the byte's value, the

     so that a second era supplies three lemmas and nothing else.

      - [Hdsc_ncr] is the whole of what the byte's VALUE is read for: the
        walk's only use is to refute the carriage-return branch (it never
        needs the alphanumeric range), so the law is one negation and it
        is true of any discipline whose bytes are body bytes.
      - [Hdsc_nl] is the LINE the newline closed.  It is [body_ok]-valued
        because that is what [ush_gets_done_line] spends on BOTH its
        conjuncts; see the lane's findings -- this is the one of the three
        that a wider era cannot supply, and the reason is the LINE axis
        ([ush_line_is] inside [ush_gets_done]) and not the discipline.
      - [Hdsc_short] is the remainder's length, which is what refutes the
        buffer-full exit. *)

     [cat f] line does not.  The reading that travels is "the era admits
     some LINE whose words are the body's parse and whose bytes are the
     ones the buffer holds" -- echo supplies it from

     static lexer tables, the allocator's first-call state and the break --
     and naming any of those would drag the parser's and the allocator's

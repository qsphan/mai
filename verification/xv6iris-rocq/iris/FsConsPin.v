(* ---- 5c.  THE UNARM AND THE TRUNC: the two that need a premise the
   commit does not carry.

   [delta_unarm i] DELETES the row at [i] and [delta_trunc i] empties the
   file at [i].  A pin at [ino] survives either exactly when [i <> ino], and
   that is what the two contracts now hand their caller: the unarm's inum is
   the one its own ARM produced, and an armed inum was absent from the view
   ([FsAbsCreateFire.aunarm_of_arm], [cre_arm_fired]'s [av !! i = None]), so
   it is neither a pinned inum nor the root; the trunc commit is owed only
   under [om_trunc vom] ([SysOpenDefs.open_trunc_piece]).  The premises
   below are therefore dischargeable from the contracts alone.  A caller
   holding [AppInv.app_sup] -- the credential that says its claim holds of
   EVERY view -- pays both steps without them either way.

   THE TWO ROW LEMMAS FIRST: a row the delta does not touch is the row it
   was.  The console's row is a DEVICE and the root's is a DIRECTORY, so
   [delta_trunc] -- which moves a FILE row -- is the identity at both
   whatever [i] is, and only the FILE pin needs [i <> ino]. *)

(* ---- 5c'.  THE TWO PREMISES, DISCHARGED FROM THE CONTRACTS ALONE ----

   [file_pin_unarm] and [cons_present_unarm] each ask for [i <> ino] and
   [i <> ROOTINO], and the unarm contract now supplies both.  Its inum is
   the one its own ARM produced ([FsAbsCreateFire.aunarm_of_arm]), and the
   arm's receipt [FsAbsCreateFire.cre_arm_fired] carries [av0 !! i = None]
   at the arm's own view: an inum the view did not have is neither the
   pin's nor the root, and those are inum inequalities, so they travel from
   [av0] to the later view the unarm fires at.  The two corollaries below
   are that step, taken once each.

   [file_pin_trunc]'s [i <> ino] is discharged one level up instead, by the
   GUARD: [SysOpenDefs.open_trunc_piece] is the commit only under
   [om_trunc vom], so an application whose opens have the bit clear owes no
   [delta_trunc] at all ([SysOpenDefs.open_trunc_piece_none]) and the
   premise never arises.  There is no pure corollary to state for it -- the
   truncation is not keyed at an inum the bundle could name (that file's
   note at [open_trunc_piece] says why).  The console's own state needs
   nothing either way: [cons_present_trunc] below has no side condition,
   because a truncation moves a FILE row and the console's is a device. *)

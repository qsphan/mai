(* EchoOut.v -- E5's APPLICATION CLAIM, THE IRIS HALF (lane ECHO-OUT).

   Design of record: the coordinator's E5 DESIGN PAGE of 2026-09-15
   (scratchpad e5-design-page.md), section 2, which REPLACES the
   ledger-anchored shape of REVISIONS 4-8: CLAIM-RESIDENT STATE, NO LEDGER
   IN ANY LINK.

   WHY THE STATE IS IN THE CLAIM AND NOT IN THE LEDGER.  The two things
   that forced the ledger-anchored shape are both gone.  [App.Happ_boot]
   founds nothing any more (milestone E moved the founding to [App.Hpow],
   which is the ONE step per era that runs the ledger and may mint linear
   content), and [App.Happ_echo] is a CLOSED entailment with no observation
   handle, so a link fired inside the echo shift cannot reach the ledger at
   all.  So each era's authorities -- its cursor, its line choices, its
   echoed list and its delivered count -- live in the PORT'S CLAIM, and the
   ledger keeps only what is about the HISTORY: the taint counter, the era
   map (whose authority is spent at [echo_led_pow_cl] and nowhere else) and
   the phi conjunct.

   THE INDEX IS THE ERA NUMBER [k := S gen_id] (ambient [RiscvLang.GenId]),
   not a ghost name: [riscv_cons_res k ho H], every link at [k],
   [app_cons/app_boot A c k].  The kernel STAMPS every history it hands the
   application with [⌜obs_boots h = S gen_id⌝].  A link at [k] therefore
   knows [k = obs_boots h] purely, and no history is ever compared against
   the ledger's inside a link -- which is essential, because the observation
   AUTHORITY lives in the state interpretation.

   THE SHAPE (redesign R2/R3).  [ecl k ho H] is the TAINT (what the licence
   pays through) or the era's own arm, which holds the era's pin, its four
   authorities and the delivered count, together with [ecl_pure]'s account
   of the whole console history [H].

   THERE IS NO WINDOW COUNTER AND NO KERNEL-LENT TOKEN.  There were both,
   and here is why they are gone.  The echo's run used to be SPLIT -- the
   bytes went out through the output claim and the log entry was filed
   later through the input claim -- so [WpUart.cons_link] returned the input
   claim at exactly the log it was handed, [SpecConsoleintr.cons_echo_shift]
   was persistent, and the application's spec had to be total over
   interleavings cons.lock forbids but never states.  The kernel therefore
   LENT the application a per-era exclusive on the PLIC payload, and a
   [ghost_var_frac nat] in QUARTERS made a second firing of one run meet five
   quarters.  Since the redesign the arm is a FIELD of the console history
   ([ConsLog.cons_hist]'s [ch_arm]) and every event steps it with the port
   invariant open, so a second open, a byte after the close and a second
   close are refuted by [ConsLog.cons_ev_ok] on the kernel's side and by the
   history's own shape on the application's.  The two descriptions the
   counter kept in step are ONE description.

   THE ERA'S FIRST WRITE needs no special step: [app_turn] (init's console
   credential, minted beside the claim at [echo_led_pow_cl] and carried to
   [App.Hinit_boot] by the kernel) is the era's cursor at zero, and at
   [P = 0] the paired claim's own [turn_auth] plus [pcount_zero] DERIVE
   [o_E so = [] /\ o_w so = []], hence [acc = []].  There is no founded arm
   to refute and no seed to spend.

   WHAT THE LINKS HAND THE PROGRAM (review S9).  A writer must prove
   [pending ps cs E !! length w = Some b] without holding any authority.  It
   gets a PERSISTENT lower bound of the era's line choices ([cs_lb]) and its
   cursor; [proc_stream_pcount] turns the two into the byte owed, because the
   process bytes of an era are one stream and the cursor is a position in it.
   [echo_write_link] and [echo_read_link] hand those back, which is what
   IO-LEAF and SH-LINE consume. *)

(* the OUTPUT claim's pure fact.

   THE STAGE IS READ THROUGH THE PARSER, NOT DIVIDED.  With a line per round
   there is no line length to divide by, so nothing here counts echoes: what
   the transcript turns on is the ERA'S INPUT [snd <$> o_E so] -- the bytes
   the console has echoed so far -- read by [LineWords]'s cut into its
   COMPLETE bodies ([nlines]) and the REST after the last newline
   ([rest_of]).  [pro_pin] is stated at that input, and [E_byte]'s
   positional law ("E's j-th byte is byte [j mod 17] of the line") is
   [E_disc], "the bytes of E parse" -- the only thing left of it once no
   position determines a byte.

   THE SAME-CYCLE FACTS LIVE HERE, AT THE CLAIM'S OWN WITNESS [ho], and not
   in the ledger (lane ECHO-OUT, section 7).  The reason is the ECHO: its
   links fire at the consputc STORES, which are later than the history the
   byte arrived at, so the ledger the shift opens is at a history the shift
   cannot name -- and no link may compare a history against the ledger's,
   because the observation AUTHORITY lives in the state interpretation.  At
   the claim's witness there is no such problem: the ECHO re-establishes the
   facts at its own [h] out of the INPUT claim's per-entry stamps, and the
   DRAIN lifts them to the run's history with [App.Htx]'s own premise
   [ho `prefix_of` h] plus the two era stamps ([EchoOutPure.
   open_seg_prefix_boots]).  The ledger is then HISTORY-FREE. *)

(* THE LEDGER'S LENGTH LAW FOR THE PROLOGUE RESOLUTION -- the TWIN of
   [cs_len_ok], and what makes the prologue's CHOICE readable off the
   cursor.  [cs_len_ok] pins how many LINE alternatives have been filed by
   the writer's position; this pins how much of the OPEN ROUND's resolution
   has been.  Without it a claim whose current round is already SETTLED --
   [pro_of] one alternative longer, so [pending_at] longer and the writer's
   [o_w] a proper prefix of it -- is a perfectly consistent state, and the
   prologue-choice write cannot tell it from the one it is actually in.

   THE ROUND A STAGE STANDS IN is [ps_round]: one per line that took
   alternative 3 (the shell's own fork panic), round 0 at the head of the
   transcript.  A block OPENS that round only at those two places
   ([ps_opens]); every other block owes no prologue at all, which is why the
   second conjunct is guarded -- unguarded it is simply false.

   THE TWO CONJUNCTS.
   (A) NOTHING IS FILED FOR A ROUND THAT HAS NOT OPENED: past the current
       round the resolution is empty.  This is what makes the block-first
       write that OPENS the next round (alternative 3) find it open.
   (B) EVERY ENTRY THE ROUND HAS IS ON THE WIRE: a prefix of the resolution
       that gives a SHORTER prologue than the stage's own was passed by the
       writer strictly.  Since an open prologue ends at a banner and filing
       an alternative appends at least its first byte
       ([EchoDisc.pro_of_open_snoc_lt]), this says exactly "the round is
       settled only once the writer has written past the block's banner",
       and it is what reconciles a writer's [~ pro_done] with the claim. *)

   shape named a stage index [17 q]) and its cursor [P], and knows only that
   its byte is the [P]-th of the stream through [I0].  That ALONE pins the
   stage: if the era's input were strictly longer, the next line's first
   echo would have folded block [I0]'s WHOLE continuation into
   [proc_before], so the cursor could not still be indexing inside it; and
   at equality the index [P] lands strictly inside the continuation, which

   child fails to exec ([pro_alts !!! 1], which re-enters the SAME round).
   The banner is the LETTER [pro_alts !!! 3]: its first byte files it
   ([echo_write_link_pro] at [a = 3]) and the rest go through
   [echo_write_link], which asks for [proc_stream ps0 cs0 I !! P = Some b].
   This discharges that at an ARBITRARY round, off two facts the loop has:
   the block's SHAPE (its panic line, if any, and then this round's prologue
   -- [EchoOutPure.pending_at_round_pre] supplies it from the round-opening
   premise) and the round's resolution so far, which after [j] failed
   sub-rounds and the banner's first byte is [pro_fail j ++ [3]]

   the window owed was named by [ein_pend], which the echo handed to the

   inside [ecl_pure].

   writer's own [inp_lb], which is a lower bound on what the console has
   DELIVERED; so at that write the delivered list already reaches the whole
   line the block answers.  WHAT IT IS FOR: the ring.  At a drop the kernel

  (* NO STEP TAKES THE LEDGER.  Every authority an era has is in its claims,
     so a link opens the port invariant and nothing else -- which is what
     makes [App.Happ_echo] a CLOSED entailment (design page, F1). *)

  (* THE ECHO'S STEP.  It closes the line the writer has just finished and
     files the byte in the era's echoed list, which is where the era's INPUT
     grows.  Three pure facts carry it, and they are about BYTES rather than
     positions:

       - [EchoOutPure.sess_prefix_det] identifies the discipline's witness
         for the segment below this input with the claim's own transcript --
         the wire says what was typed -- and hands back that the round the
         closing line reads is SETTLED, which is what [pro_pin] needs at the
         input's new last line.  The witness is at the COMPLETED prefix
         ([LineWords.done_of]), because that is where the relaxed discipline
         pins the wire;
       - [EchoOutPure.next_input_of_complete] says the process output owed
         at this stage is complete.  At a line's first byte that is the pin
         again; mid-line the stage owes nothing, so there is nothing to say;
       - [EchoOutPure.E_disc_of_hist] says the era's bytes PARSE, off the
         segment's own discipline and the per-entry index law.  It replaces
         the positional reading ("E's j-th byte is byte [j mod 17] of the
         line"), which at a line per round says nothing.

     THE INPUT NUMBER IS THE KERNEL'S, NOT THE WIRE'S.  That the era has
     echoed EVERY input before this one is (K1) -- the receive FIFO is
     drained in arrival order -- plus (A1) -- every log entry is echoed.
     The premise below is the two of them at this arm; [ecl_step_byte] reads
     it out of [ch_arm_era], where the open recorded it. *)

  (* (W') THE WRITE AT A BLOCK'S FIRST BYTE (REVISION 7(d)).  The choice of
     continuation is the PROGRAM's knowledge -- sh knows whether it is about
     to echo the words it just read or report an exec failure -- and the
     observer can read it back off the wire because the four alternatives
     of a line settle every comparison the transcript takes part in
     ([EchoDisc.line_alts_of_prefix_bytes]).  So the writer supplies the
     alternative's INDEX beside its first byte, and the step files it: the
     claim's list grows from [q-1] to [q] at the input's [q]-th completed
     line, and every later byte of the block goes through [ecl_step_write]
     against the lower bound this returns.  The PROLOGUE (before any line)
     is not a choice and grows nothing -- which is why [I0 <> []] is a
     premise there. *)

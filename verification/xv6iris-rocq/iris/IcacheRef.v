(* IcacheRef.v -- WHAT A REFERENCE TO AN ITABLE ENTRY IS.

   This file is a SPLIT-OUT BASE of [IcacheInv.v], and the split exists for
   exactly one reason: [FileInv.v] and [ProcInv.v] must be able to say
   "this [struct file] / this [p->cwd] holds an inode reference", and they
   sit UNDERNEATH the file-system stack ([IrefSlots.v] imports [FileInv.v],
   and [IcacheInv.v] imports [IrefSlots.v]).  So the reference predicate --
   the two identity cells and the Arc-style count algebra -- lives here,
   where nothing above the register/memory layer is needed, and
   [IcacheInv.v] re-exports it verbatim.

   The ENTRY ITSELF -- the field addresses, [ientry], the algebra's
   constructors and boot literals, [Class icfg], [Record ic_names],
   [icfg_alloc] and the boot regimes -- is one layer further down, in
   [IcacheRefDefs.v], which this file re-exports; and the POINTER-KEYED
   reading [inode_held], with the [CtxMorph] transports, is one layer up in
   [IcacheHeld.v], which re-exports this one.  Every name in the three is
   unchanged, and the design write-up is still
   claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md §3.

   WHAT IS *NOT* HERE: the [ref]-word invariant, the itable lock's
   resource, the escrow, the ghost steps.  Those stay in [IcacheInv.v] /
   [IcacheEscrow.v] -- they need the log, the disk and the inode region,
   and nothing at the file-table altitude may see them.

   ---- THE CANONICAL PAIRING (design/fs-icache.md §14.6, Plan B) --------

   A reference is THREE fractions that are ALWAYS THE SAME NUMBER:

       inode_ref k q dev inum
         = iref_tok k q                    ∗ inode_ident k (DfracOwn q) …
         = (iref_frag k q ∗ live_frac k q) ∗ inode_ident k (DfracOwn q) …
            ^ count authority  ^ liveness pool   ^ the two identity cells

   THIS IS LOAD-BEARING, and it is what §14.6 means by "mass conservation IS
   the witness".  A SHARE ([inode_shr k s]) is an identity slice plus a
   liveness slice CARVED OUT OF A PARENT REFERENCE ([inode_ref_carve]): the
   parent keeps its whole count fragment but drops to
   [inode_ref_short k (q + s) q] -- ident and liveness at [q], authority
   still at [q + s].  Two consequences, and they are the entire reason for
   the convention:

   (1) SHARES CANNOT OUTLIVE THEIR PARENT.  Every contract that SPENDS a
       reference (iput above all) states [inode_ref k q], i.e. all three
       fractions equal.  A parent with a share outstanding cannot produce
       one, so it cannot close; only [inode_ref_gather] puts it back.

   (2) IPUT NEEDS NO WITNESS LEDGER.  At REF-1 (count one) the closer's [q]
       IS the whole outstanding [qt], so its liveness slice is [qt]; the
       invariant's own pool arm at a live slot is exactly [1 - qt]
       ([IcacheInv.live_slot]); the two join to the WHOLE unit, which is
       precisely the shape a FREE slot's arm has.  The last close therefore
       RETIRES the slot's pool by arithmetic, inside the invariant opening it
       already performs -- and had a share been outstanding, its own slice
       could not have coexisted with that unit.  No count of shares is kept
       anywhere, because none is needed.  [ProofIput]'s REF-1 derivations do
       not move.

   The pool exists for the SHARE's sake, not iput's: a share-holder has no
   count fragment (design §14.5 -- [positiveR] has no zero, so a share is NOT
   an [icacheUR] fragment), and still has to refute ilock's [ref < 1] panic
   without the itable lock.  It does that with [live_frac]: a FREE slot's
   whole unit sits inside [IcacheInv.itable_body], so a lock-free reader that
   owns any slice at all learns [k ∈ dom M]
   ([IcacheInv.iref_live_load_au]).  The identity cells cannot do that job --
   a free slot's identity halves live in the itable LOCK and in the escrow,
   neither of which a lock-free reader may open. *)

   arm would meet a raw [inode_ident], which is not a seam that can be
   crossed: it is ONE TIER DISAGREEING WITH ITSELF.  The cheapest place to

   all three files take the flip.  (The alternative -- a per-file [Notation] re-declaring
   [↦₄] raw in IcacheInv/IcacheEscrow -- only moves the disagreement, since

  (* ---- THE TWO FLAVOURS OF REFERENCE PROVENANCE (§5', RULING R) --------

     ONE unit rides with every icache reference for the reference's whole
     life: minted at the iget that created it, copied at an idup, returned at
     the iput that closes it.  The FLAVOUR records which licence paid for the
     mint -- [runit_claim] for the [ClaimL] iget that is ialloc's own (the
     claimant's reference into its own claim box), [runit_plain] for every
     other.  [runit_plain] is the r column's own fragment -- the column
     keeps its two landed moves ([link_mint_ref]/[link_spend_ref]) and only
     the SECOND flavour is new. *)

  Definition runit_claim (z : Z) : iProp Σ :=

  (* the flavour, as an index -- so a contract that carries a unit of the
     caller's OWN flavour (SpecIdup's copy, SpecIput's spend) binds one
     boolean rather than casing on a disjunction at every seam *)
  Definition runit (b : bool) (z : Z) : iProp Σ :=

  (* THE UNIT EVERY REST HOME CARRIES.  Every REST HOME and every

     demand" and no more, and its thirty-odd positional call sites stay
     byte-identical because the name -- not its unfolding -- is what they
     spell.

     REDEFINED BY RULING C' (iclaim-ledger.md §5''''.1): it was
     [∃ b, runit b z], the flavour FORGOTTEN.  Under C' the claim flavour
     never reaches a rest home at all: [ireg_withdraw]'s ClaimK arm is a
     CONVERSION -- it takes the claimant's [runit_claim] together with the
     [iclaim] and returns [runit_plain] -- so the only unit that ever
     leaves ilock, and therefore the only one any rest home or any [iput]
     ever sees, is the plain one.  Spelling that here rather than casing on
     an existential is what lets the withdraw's plain arm read [1 <= r] off
     a rest home's unit with no disjunction to resolve; the 72 contract
     positions that mention the name are unchanged. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------
     THE FLAVOURED REFERENCE PACKAGE (SIMP-2, ghost-simplification.md §5.1)

     NOT a new invention: [inode_held] below has been the package since
     item 7a-wire (reference ∗ unit, flavour existential), and the walker
     cone plus both rest homes already speak it.  What SIMP-2 does is push
     the SAME shape DOWN into the four fs contracts that still spell the
     unbundled trio -- [SpecIget]'s post, [SpecIput]/[SpecIunlockput]'s
     pre, [SpecIdup]'s two sides, [SpecIalloc]'s receipt -- so that iget
     hands back ONE resource and iput demands ONE.  Each restatement is a
     RENAME (the intro/spend lemmas below are [iFrame]/[reflexivity]);
     none of them adds content, and that is the satisfiability discipline
     (iclaim-ledger.md §5''''): every package has an INTRO lemma stated
     from exactly the producer site's rows.

     The flavour is an INDEX rather than an existential here because the
     mint site knows it ([is_claim l] at iget) and the two consumers want
     different ones: ialloc's own [ClaimL] reference carries
     [runit_claim], everything else carries the plain unit.  [inode_refp]
     -- the plain form -- is the one and only shape that ever reaches an
     iput, because ilock's ClaimK arm ([ireg_withdraw]) CONVERTS the claim
     flavour before any close (RULING C').  So [inode_refb true] needs no
     spend form, and [inode_held] is [inode_refp] with its indices hidden. *)

  Definition inode_refb (b : bool) (k : nat) (q : Qp)
      (dev inum : mword 32) : iProp Σ :=

  (* the plain, iput-consumable form.  Under RULING C' [runit false] IS
     [runit_any], so this is [inode_refb false] on the nose
     ([inode_refb_false_refp], by [reflexivity]) -- but it is spelled with
     [runit_any] so that its ONE delta step lands on precisely the pair
     [SpecIput] states today, with no iota in the way at the ~30 landed
     positional sites that unpack it. *)

  (* THE SHORT-PARENT PACKAGE.  [wp_iunlockput_*] is "iunlock; iput", and
     what its caller holds across the call is not a whole reference but the
     PARENT of the carve it made for ilock -- so the row it states is
     [inode_ref_short] beside the same unit, and its package is this.  The
     unit rides with the SHORT PARENT and not with the travelling share
     (item 7a-wire: a share is not a reference and pays for no count move),
     which is exactly what makes [inode_refp_carve] below an equivalence:
     carving a share out of a package leaves a short package, and gathering
     puts the reference back together with its unit still attached. *)

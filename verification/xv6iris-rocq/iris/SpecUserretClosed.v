(* SpecUserretClosed.v -- userret, CLOSED: the public interface of the whole
   trap loop, stated where the kernel first enters it.

   [SpecUserret]'s [wp_userret_pt] is a CONTINUATION spec -- it hands its
   caller a User-mode machine and asks what happens next.  This is the same
   contract with that question answered: run userret from forkret's tail and
   the machine keeps running, forever, through arbitrarily many rounds of

     userret -> user code -> uservec -> usertrap -> userret -> ...

   There is no premise about user-mode execution and none about the kernel's
   re-entry: [SpecUser]'s WP supplies the first and the Löb induction in
   ProofUserretClosed.v supplies the second.

   WHAT IS LEFT ON THE OUTSIDE.  Three things, and each is a premise that
   already existed one level down rather than anything this statement
   invents:

   * [loop_ok C pt] -- the four config fields the loop pins (stvec at the
     trampoline, mie at [MIE_S], medeleg at [MEDELEG_S], the config fraction
     whole) plus the two descriptor facts uservec's own satp switch needs.
     Every round re-establishes it, which is what makes it a loop invariant
     rather than an assumption about the first round.
   * THE mstatus GAP and THE TRAPFRAME KERNEL-WORDS GAP -- [SpecUservec]'s
     own two undischarged premises, verbatim.  They are cross-round
     historical facts ("userret's sret set SPIE, so the trap saw it";
     "prepare_return armed the four kernel words"), and closing them needs
     ghost tracking that no tier carries yet.  Passing them through is the
     honest thing: they are the same obligation, not a new one.
   * The kernel-side residue, as [Rut_at]: the bundle usertrap hands the loop
     and gets back unchanged on the next trap.

   THE TRAPFRAME'S 31 SAVE SLOTS ARE NOT ON THIS BOUNDARY, and an earlier
   statement of it that listed them beside the residue was UNSATISFIABLE:
   the residue OWNS that page ([UsertrapRes.ut_res_bare] -> [proc_priv_nopt]
   -> [ProcInv.tf_page], at full ownership), so
   [tf_page tfp ws -∗ tf_pa tfp 40 ↦ₚ₈{dq} v -∗ False] refutes any caller
   holding both.  userret only READS those words, and the proof opens them
   out of the residue itself ([usertrap_res_tf_open]) and closes them back
   before user mode -- which is also what every LOOP round already did.  A
   caller therefore hands over the residue and nothing about the page. *)

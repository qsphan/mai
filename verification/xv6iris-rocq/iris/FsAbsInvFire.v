(* FsAbsInvFire.v -- THE GENERIC DISCHARGERS: every AU bundle an fs-syscall
   contract asks its caller for, satisfied by a client that knows nothing
   about the abstract state, at receipts that say nothing.

   WHAT THIS IS FOR.  The AU contracts ([SysOpenDefs], [SpecSysMknod],
   [SysUnlinkDefs], [SpecSysRead]/[SpecFileread], [SpecSysWrite]/
   [SpecFilewrite], [SpecCreate]) take, beside the
   landed frame, a bundle of caller-supplied fupds: the walk premise (one
   [ax_hop] per path element, fired at the era lend) and the commits (one
   per linearization instant, handed the kernel's HALF of the abstract
   map's authority -- app-instances.md section 2).  A consumer that wants
   to run a syscall WITHOUT learning anything about the abstract state --
   the dispatch, today -- still has to supply that bundle.  Each lemma
   below supplies one piece, with every receipt [True] and every cursor
   [True]: the read-kind commits hand the lent half straight back; the
   write-kind commits hand it back with THE CALLER'S STEP beside the
   phase-2 fupd.

   THE STEP, AND WHERE A CLIENT THAT KNOWS NOTHING GETS IT.  A write-kind
   shape owes [AppInv.app_step]: "the application's claim about the
   pre-view survives the delta" (app-instances.md section 7).  A client that
   answers for NO abstract state pays it out of [AppInv.app_sup], the
   SUPPLY: the application's claim held of every view, which is exactly what
   makes every delta free ([AppInv.app_step_acc], one line, no side
   condition).  So every write-kind discharger below takes the supply -- a
   PERSISTENT CREDENTIAL, born at boot and carried down the trap round -- and
   NO invariant at all: it opens nothing, and it needs neither the row to
   exist nor the mask to admit [appN].  A VERIFIED program pays the same
   [app_step] from its own deposit instead, at its own families; these
   lemmas are what the DISPATCHER hands the contracts in the meantime, and
   what the deposit class's supply law is proved from
   ([UexecExecInst]).

   THE MASK.  Every commit is at [appE] = [↑appN] ([AppInv]'s note).  The
   read/write dischargers open NOTHING of their own: the offset shadow is
   lent and returned unmoved (the piece-shape rule), and the kernel's fire
   lemma advances it out of the descriptor row's [OffGv.off_user_inv]. *)

  (* READ'S WHOLE INPUT, at the trivial receipt and the trivial refund, AND
     AT A BARE DESCRIPTOR STATE -- which is the form the ARM's deposit class
     needs: a process's key names its descriptor STATES
     ([FdSlots.fd_st_of_key]) and never the kernel's [ofile] pointer
     array, so the discharger cannot be stated at [SpecArgfd.sys_fd_st].
     The dispatcher's arm bridges the two with
     [SpecArgfd.sys_fd_st_of_key].

     IT COSTS ITS CLIENT NOTHING AT ALL, at every key: read's one piece
     lends the offset shadow and takes it back unmoved, so no descriptor
     row and no offset invariant is needed, and no application step is paid
     -- a read moves no row.  This is what makes read's bundle payable by
     an arbitrary user process under the ARM. *)
  (* ...AND THE CONSOLE ARM IS PAID FROM THE SUPPLY ITSELF (app-echo.md,
     lane CONS-CURSOR, C3, and the LEASE ruling).  A read of the console
     takes [ConsoleInv.cons_acc fsc_cons app_rdcred Rd] -- ONE ARM, two
     disjuncts -- and this is the TAINTED one: the caller hands in the
     credential it already holds, which is [app_sup] itself (the left arm
     of [AppInv.app_rdcred]), and owes [Rd]
     at every position, which at the generic family's [fun _ _ => True] is
     free.

     THAT IS WHY THE ARM IS NOT AN EXCLUSIVE TOKEN.  The law below is a
     FIELD of [UexecSG]'s class ([xv6_sbundle_of_supply_ne]), stated at
     [□ ssupply], and has to hold at EVERY number for an arbitrary program:
     a console arm demanding the reader token would not merely be
     unprovable there -- taken as a [□] premise it is INCONSISTENT (open it
     three times and hold [ghost_var_frac γ (1/2) _] thrice), which would make
     every generic corollary vacuous while the audit still printed the
     thirteen.  So the arm is payable from a PERSISTENT credential, and the
     one the generic slot already runs on is the one it takes. *)
  (* AT AN ARBITRARY PAYLOAD [P] (app-echo.md, "SH-LINE RULING", R1).
     read's input is a wand from the caller's exit payload, and the
     generic family's is [True] ([UexecSG.sexit_pay_pt]) -- but the same
     proof pays at ANY [P], and has to: a leaf re-keys the family it mints
     at its OWN payload, which for a program with a real one is linear.
     Nothing is duplicated: what the console arm owes is [∀ cur dc, |==>
     P ∗ True], and a [∀] over a constant is that constant -- the caller
     takes its [P] back at ONE position, the one the read landed on. *)
  (* ...AND THE CONSOLE LICENCE PAYS THE CONSOLE ARM'S SECOND HALF (lane
     CONS-IO, milestone B, B4).  Read's console deposit carries the
     boundary's read link as well as the ring's payment, and the licence
     that pays it comes off the TAINT ([WpUart.cons_licence_of_taint],
     lane SUP-ONE; it used to be a third conjunct of
     [UexecExecInst.xv6_ssupply]) -- which since the redesign is the
     port's ONE licence, good for any event -- so this arm costs the
     generic process nothing new: it claims nothing about what came in
     ([rf_in] at [fun _ => True]) and the licence hands over a link at any
     [ws] whatever. *)
  (* ...AND THE PIPE ARM IS PAID BY THE TAINT (design/pipe.md, "The byte
     queue"): the generic process holds no fragment of any pipe, so its
     read disconnects the pipe's ghost state at the application's taint --
     the kill credential, which the supply already carries. *)
  (* ...AND THE LICENCE IS THE TAINT'S (lane SUP-ONE): it was a premise
     here, carried in the generic supply beside the taint; it is now the

     THE CONSOLE ARM IS NOT FREE ANY MORE (lane OUT-FUPD; see the note on

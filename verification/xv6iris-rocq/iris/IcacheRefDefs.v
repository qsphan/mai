(* IcacheRefDefs.v -- THE ITABLE ENTRY: ITS GEOMETRY, ITS CONSTANTS AND
   THE ALGEBRA'S LITERALS.

   THIS FILE IS [IcacheRef.v]'s DEPENDENCY-LIGHT BASE, and the split exists
   for the reason that file's own split existed one layer up: a consumer
   that needs only a NAME off the cache -- [EscrowDefs] wants [icfg],
   [icfg_pcrp] and [icfg_reg]; [FsCfg] wants [ic_names]; [InodeRef] wants
   [NINODE] and [ientry] -- should not wait for, or re-elaborate, the
   reference predicate's nine hundred lines of splits, carves and
   [Timeless] instances.  Sixty-odd files in the tree are in exactly that
   position, and on the build's critical path [EscrowDefs] sat DIRECTLY
   behind the whole of [IcacheRef] for three field projections.

   WHAT IS HERE: the five in-core scalar field addresses and the entry
   geometry ([ientry] and its four laws); the reference-count algebra's
   CONSTRUCTORS and BOOT LITERALS (the [lelem*] layering, [icnt_boot_map],
   [frzm_boot_map], [link_boot_map], [live_boot_map], [hpn_boot_map] and
   their validity); the descriptor accessors ([ic_dep_gname], [ic_dep_lo],
   [ic_dep_rd]); [Class icfg] -- THE inode cache's global constants -- and
   [Record ic_names]; the boot allocation ([icfg_alloc] and the four family
   allocators it runs on); the per-generation type one-shot's vocabulary
   ([Section IcacheIty]); and the boot-shelter regimes [ireg_boot] /
   [ireg_open] / [ireg_regime], which are three definitions over that
   one-shot and are named by thirty spec files that touch nothing else in
   the cache.

   WHAT IS NOT HERE: everything that says what a REFERENCE is.  The link
   ledger's fragments and movers, the liveness pool, [inode_ident],
   [inode_ref] / [inode_shr] / [inode_ref_short] and their algebra are in
   [IcacheRef.v]; [inode_held] -- the same reference keyed by the pointer a
   register holds -- and the [CtxMorph] transports are in [IcacheHeld.v].
   Both re-export their base, so a file that wants the whole reading still
   names exactly one of them.

   The design write-up is claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md §3; the header of
   [IcacheRef.v] carries the CANONICAL PAIRING argument that motivates the
   shapes this file's literals are stated at. *)

   still here, beside the design commentary that justifies them.
   Xv6Cameras.v carries a one-paragraph digest of each; the full
   argument is the prose below. *)

(* RustBelt's Arc algebra, exactly as [FileInv.frefUR] uses it for
   [struct file]: [M !! k = Some (q, n)] means "itable slot [k] is live,
   with [n] outstanding references holding [q] of its identity fields
   between them"; [k ∉ dom M] means the slot is FREE.

   The frac x count pairing is the whole trick and it is what the design
   note calls REF-1 EXCLUSIVITY: [fracR] has no unit and [positiveR] has no
   zero, so [Some (q,1) ≼ Some (qt,n)] forces [n = 1 -> q = qt].  A thread
   that holds a reference and reads [ip->ref == 1] therefore holds the
   WHOLE outstanding share -- there is no other reference in the system.
   That is [IcacheInv.iref_lookup], and it is the algebraic half of the
   theorem xv6's comment above iput asserts.                             *)

(* ---- THE LIVENESS POOL (design §14.6) --------------------------------

   ONE fractional unit per itable slot, and NOT an [auth]: the whole point
   is that the mass is CONSERVED rather than counted, so there is no
   authority element to be the counter.  [IcacheInv.itable_body] holds the
   WHOLE unit of every FREE slot and the arm [1 - qt] of every live one;
   the outstanding [qt] rides with the count fragments ([iref_tok]), which
   is what makes a reference's three fractions equal (see the header) and
   what lets the last close reassemble a free slot's unit from the closer's
   own share plus the invariant's arm.

   Because nothing is an authority, no lemma below is an [own_update]: a
   carve is a SPLIT and a gather is a JOIN.  §14.5's demand that carving be
   an auth-guarded EVENT was aimed at a LEDGER that has to count shares;
   under §14.6 there is no ledger, and conservation does the counting.

   ---- THE GENERATION RIDES HERE (design §17.1(iii)/§17.2 piece 1) ----

   Each slot's unit carries an [agree]d GNAME beside its fraction: slot [k]'s
   CURRENT GENERATION.  §17 wanted a persistent per-generation type witness
   and §17.1(ii) killed it -- a persistent fragment cannot say "this
   generation is the CURRENT one", and currency is the whole obligation.
   Currency is a REVOCABLE, reference-tied fact, and the only reference-tied
   fractional resources in the tree are [inode_ident] (which pins IDENTITY,
   reused across a free + realloc, so it cannot key a type) and this pool.

   The bump needs the WHOLE unit at the slot, which exists in exactly one
   place -- [IcacheInv.live_slot]'s free arm, under the itable lock, i.e.
   iget's recycle.  That is the right side condition BY CONSTRUCTION: a bump
   is impossible while any reference or share exists.

   [live_frac] keeps its ARITY by existentially quantifying the gname, so
   [iref_tok], [inode_ref], [inode_shr], [inode_ref_short], [inode_held*] and
   every Spec stated over them are TEXTUALLY UNCHANGED.  Two slices of one
   slot AGREE on the generation ([live_gen_agree]) -- which is the mechanism
   the whole §17' design runs on. *)

(* ---- THE PER-GENERATION TYPE ONE-SHOT (design §17.2 piece 2) ----------

   THE TYPE CANNOT BE SET AT THE RECYCLE and that is what forces two levels.
   iget's recycle is where the whole liveness unit exists, so it is where the
   generation is bumped -- but at that instruction the type is UNKNOWN (iget
   writes [valid = 0]; nothing reads the dinode until ilock's [bread]), and
   after the recycle nobody holds the whole unit again until the last iput.
   So the generation's [agree] carries a fresh GNAME rather than a type, and
   the type attaches later, through a standard one-shot at that gname:
   iget mints it PENDING, and ilock's fill -- the only instruction in the
   kernel that knows [di_type dn] -- SPENDS it.

   Soundness of "the type never changes under a live generation" is then not
   an assertion but the one-shot's own exclusivity: 0 -> ty needs an
   unallocated slot, ty -> 0 happens only at the last-reference iput's free
   path (which exits the generation first), and ty -> ty' does not exist in
   this kernel.

   The RA is [KptGhost.kptR]'s, at [bv 16] ([DinodeEnc.di_type]'s width);
   the vocabulary below is [kpt_unset]/[kpt_shoot]/[kpt_lb]/[kpt_lb_agree]
   renamed, deliberately, so the shape is the one already proven here. *)

(* ---- THE INODE-REFERENCE ALGEBRA (design/fs-icache.md §20.2) ---------

   ONE per-inum authority [● (c, r)] with one exclusive slot and one
   counter:

     [c]  an [ialloc] has claimed the inum and has not committed
          ([iclaim z], EXCLUSIVE -- §20.9(j): a counter would let a second
          claim of the same inum through);
     [r]  §20.7's (M1) carrier: the count of outstanding icache REFERENCES
          to the inum, minted at [iget] from the caller's licence and
          returned at [iput]'s [ip->ref--] ([runit_plain z]).

   [f] (the freeze phase, below) and [rc] (the claim-flavoured reference
   count, RULING R) sit above them in the same element.

   LINK COUNTS AND TYPES ARE NOT IN THIS ELEMENT.  They are ONE SEPARATE
   RA -- [Xv6Cameras.fsLinkUR], an [auth (gmultiset ity)] per inum whose
   fragments ARE the counted dirents (design/fs-state.md §6½), with the
   authority in [InodeRegion.ireg_lnk] beside the record and the fragments
   in the directories' payloads.

   Filed as a [gmap] under ONE ambient gname ([icfg_link] below) rather
   than one gname per inum, for [icfg_iref]'s reason: a per-inum name
   could not be read off a class. *)
(* ---- THE FREEZE COLUMN (claude-notes/projects/iclaim-ledger.md §2.1/§2.3)

   [f] is iput's TRANSITION token, the free-side twin of [c]: while it is
   held the inum is exclusively in-transition, from the freer's commit
   ([ip_free_entry]'s [ref==1 && valid && nlink==0] decision, under the
   FIRST itable-lock hold) to the off-lock deposit at +0xba.  A SEPARATE
   column and not a flavoured [c] (§2.1's RULING): the landed §7.12 boot
   clause on [c] stays byte-identical and [ireg_claim_au]'s
   pending-refutation is untouched.

   IT IS PHASED, AND THE PHASE HAS THREE STATES rather than the design's
   two (deviation, recorded here).  §2.3 as amended by the ZZProbeIcnt
   feasibility probe wants [FrzPre] (icnt = 1) stepping to [FrzPost]
   (icnt = 0) at iput+0x8a's last close, because the strict [icnt = 1] pin
   is FALSE across the whole window.  That is [FrzPre]/[FrzPost] verbatim.
   [FrzOff] is the UNFROZEN state, and it exists because a [None -> Some]
   mint cannot be made EXCLUSIVE inside the region: nothing a runtime
   freezer holds refutes a standing [FrzPre] at the same inum (the boot
   arm's [ireg_boot] does, by [ity_pending_excl]; the persistent
   [ireg_open] does not).  With [FrzOff] the "right to freeze" is itself
   the exclusive fragment [ifreeze FrzOff z] -- it rides under the itable
   lock beside §2.2's [icnt] slot half, and [InodeRegion.ireg_freeze_au]
   SWAPS it for [ifreeze_pre].  The mint is then a fragment-in-hand step
   ([link_freeze_step]) and double-freeze is refuted by [Excl] alone.
   The boot ledger uses the [FrzOff] form throughout. *)

(* NAMED, and that is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: with the column
   written inline as [optionUR (exclR (leibnizO frz))] the f-cell's binders
   elaborate at the raw [option (excl frz)] and [apply prod_local_update']
   can no longer unify its [prodR ?A ?B] against [ucmra_cmraR linkElemUR]
   (verified both ways on the lane).  Every f binder below is at [frzUR]. *)

(* RULING G' (iclaim-ledger.md §6''): "this phase is the window's FIRST half"
   as a decidable boolean, so that every clause that used to be stated as the
   equation [f = Some (Excl FrzPre)] keeps a one-[reflexivity] shape now that
   [FrzPre] carries a payload. *)
Definition frz_ispre (ph : frz) : bool :=
  match ph with FrzPre _ => true | _ => false end.
Definition frz_preb (f : frzUR) : bool :=
  match f with Some (Excl ph) => frz_ispre ph | _ => false end.

(* ...and WHICH regime arm the phase is carrying, [None] at the unfrozen
   state.  The freeze's movers step the phase but never the index, and that
   invariant is exactly what [InodeRegion.ireg_fsh_step] reads. *)
Definition frz_reg (ph : frz) : option frzidx :=
  match ph with
  | FrzOff     => None
  | FrzPre rg  => Some rg
  | FrzPost rg => Some rg
  end.

(* THE FIVE LANDED COLUMNS, NAMED.  Naming the sub-cmra is not cosmetic
   either: with the whole seven-deep nest written as one anonymous
   expression, the FIRST [apply prod_local_update'] of every chain below
   re-discovers the entire structure by unification and does not terminate
   in five minutes (measured on the lane; at six columns it was instant).
   With [linkElemUR0] an atom the same chains are ~1s. *)
(* ---- THE TYPED CLAIM COLUMN (iclaim-ledger.md §5.2(a), item 7b) -------

   The c column carries the claimed TYPE, not a bare "this box is claimed":
   the fill has to learn WHICH type [ialloc] claimed, since that is the
   source of [create_fresh_ty]'s [di_type dnc = ty].  Spelled as a NAMED
   atom for the f column's reason (the comment above [frzR]): a raw
   [optionUR (exclR (leibnizO (bv 16)))] inside the nest makes [apply
   prod_local_update']'s unification diverge. *)



(* ---- THE CLAIM-FLAVOURED REFERENCE COLUMN (iclaim-ledger.md §5', RULING R)

   [rc] is the r-column's SECOND flavour, and it goes in exactly as the f
   column did (§2.1's defaulted-alias trick): [lelemc] is the widened element
   and [lelemf] is [lelemc ... 0], so every landed fragment definition and
   every landed [lelem]/[lelemf] literal below is BYTE-IDENTICAL and only the
   AUTHORITY's spelling ([link_auth]) grows the column.

   THE TWO FLAVOURS.  [r] (now read as [r_plain]) counts the icache
   references minted at an iget that presented a NON-[ClaimL] licence;
   [rc] counts those minted from a [ClaimL].  They are the SAME unit of
   provenance in two components -- there is no weakening between them (the two
   live in different components of the authority) -- and what the split buys is RULING R's pin, the third
   conjunct of [InodeRegion.ireg_ref_ok]:

       c <> None  ->  r_plain = 0

   "no plainly-licenced reference exists to a claim box".  That is the
   premise §5'.3's disjunctive [ireg_withdraw] runs on: a caller presenting
   its plain unit collides [1 <= r_plain] against the pin and DERIVES
   [c = None], so the fifteen non-create ilock sites pay with the unit their
   reference already carries and nothing retires. *)


(* the ledger element, spelled so no proof below has to nest seven
   projections by hand.  [lelem] is named ONLY inside this file (verified
   by grep), which is what made the [w]-widening -- and now the V5'
   widening -- a local edit.

   THE f-COLUMN GOES IN AS A DEFAULTED ALIAS: [lelemf] is the widened
   element and [lelem] is [lelemf ... None].  Every landed fragment
   definition and every landed literal below is therefore BYTE-IDENTICAL
   (they all sit at [f = None]), and only the AUTHORITY's spelling
   ([link_auth]) grows the column. *)
(* THE ELEMENT IS [c] and [r] (plus [f] and [rc] above them) and nothing
   else: link counts and types are ONE separate RA (fs-state.md §6½), not a
   column here.  The defaulted-alias layering below is unchanged. *)
Definition lelem0 (c : ctyUR) (r : nat) : linkElemUR0 := (c, r).

Definition lelemc (c : ctyUR) (r : nat) (f : frzUR) (rc : nat)
  : linkElemUR := ((lelem0 c r, f) : linkElemUR1, rc).

Definition lelemf (c : ctyUR) (r : nat) (f : frzUR)
  : linkElemUR := lelemc c r f 0.

Definition lelem (c : ctyUR) (r : nat) : linkElemUR := lelemf c r None.

(* ---- THE CHECKOUT DEPOSIT'S DESCRIPTOR (design §14.8) ----------------

   WHAT A CHECKED-OUT ENTRY'S ESCROW ARM IS HOLDING FOR THE THREAD INSIDE.
   The escrow's OUT arm (IcacheEscrow.ic_out) can be reached from two
   different deposits -- ilock, which enters holding a SHARE, and iput's
   authority-side window, which enters holding a REFERENCE -- and the two
   PARKERS are resource-indistinguishable (§14.8's two-parkers problem: both
   carry ½ of each identity cell, the full valid word, the payload and
   [SleepLock.sleeplocked], and nothing else).  So neither could refute the
   other's arm, and [ic_swap_park] could only return the disjunction, which
   iput cannot absorb.

   The repair is to make the ENTRY SLEEPLOCK's own resource carry the answer.
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_tok] used to be [WpLock.lock_tok_excl]; it becomes
   [ghost_var_frac _ 1 DepNone], still exclusive at fraction one (so the sleeplock
   and its [ic_tok_exclusive] are unchanged), and the checkout UPDATES it to
   the descriptor of what it is depositing and splits ½ into the arm, keeping
   ½.  At the park the two halves meet and [ghost_var_agree] pins the KIND,
   the FRACTION and the IDENTITY at once -- so each parker selects its own
   arm deterministically, and both [SpecIunlock]'s and [SpecFileread]'s
   postcondition existentials over the fraction disappear.

   It lives HERE, beside [icacheG], for [icache_idG]'s reason: the class
   field is what keeps nine spec and proof files from growing a binder.

   THE FOURTH FIELD IS THE GENERATION (design §17.3 (A1), ratified §17.4).
   Under §17' the escrow's live arms hold a ½ slice of the slot's liveness
   unit AT A NAMED GENERATION, and a PARKER holds no [live_frac] at all
   (§14.8's two-parkers inventory is explicit about that).  So the
   descriptor's [ghost_var_agree] is the only handle by which
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_swap_park] can pin the returning payload's generation to
   the arm's -- the descriptor already pins kind, fraction and identity, and
   generation is the fourth at no new cost. *)
(* ---- THE COUNT COUPLING's RA (iclaim-ledger.md §2.2, ZZProbeIcnt §1) ---

   A per-inum 1/2-1/2 AGREEMENT on a [nat] -- "the in-core reference count
   of [z]".  A [dfrac_agree] on [leibnizO nat], filed as a bare [gmap Z] under one
   ambient gname ([icfg_icnt] below) for [icfg_link]'s reason, and WITHOUT
   an auth: there is no third party that ever needs to read the count
   without holding a half, and dropping the auth is what keeps the update
   requirement honest -- exactly "both halves in hand", which is what
   forces every count move to reach the region's half (§2.2). *)

(* ---- THE FREEZE MIRROR's RA (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16 = RULING A⁗) -------

   A per-inum 1/2-1/2 AGREEMENT on a [bool] -- "inum [z]'s f column stands at
   [FrzPre]".  [icntUR]'s pattern transposed from [leibnizO nat] to
   [leibnizO bool], and here for the reason §3.16 records:

   RULING A‴ asked for exactly this and IVb REFUTED it -- but the refutation
   was TEMPORAL, not structural.  A‴ read the mirror as a knowledge channel
   whose frozen side had to park the dying reference's live mass, and at the
   free path's LOCK-FREE span (+0x66..+0x82) that mass is scattered across the
   escrow's OUT arm and the freezer's own hand, so there was nothing to park.
   A⁗ parks it AT THE MINT (+0x50, first itable-lock hold, BEFORE the +0x5e
   deposit), where it is all in the freezer's hand: [iref_tok k q] carries
   [live_frac k q] by definition and the payload checkout carries the [1/2].
   With the park minted there the mirror does three jobs at once:

     (S1a) the mint site DECIDES [islot2]'s live arm LEFT with no invariant
           open at all -- parked 1/2 + my 1/2 + my q overflows the slot's live
           unit ([IcacheInv.live_frac_bound]) -- so the mint's [ifreeze_off]
           is extractable;
     (S1b) at iput+0x8a the freezer's [ifreeze_pre] fixes the f column at the
           region open ([IcacheInv.link_freeze_agree]) and the mirror clause
           ([InodeRegion.ireg_frzm_ok]) forces the arm RIGHT, so the parked
           mass comes home for the eviction;
     (2.6b) a FOREIGN idup's up-count at a [FrzPre] inum now dies for real:
           the parked [q + 1/2] plus the caller's own share feed
           [IcacheInv.live_whole_share_absurd].

   AND IT IS THE ONLY HANDLE the f column has outside the region: the frozen
   arms of [IcacheEscrow.ic_payload_arm] and [ic_out_frz] are decided by the
   slot's freeze SELECTOR ([frzsel], RULING R-e) and by [ifreeze_pre], and
   nothing beside the mirror crosses the region/lock wall.  Keyed by [Z] and
   ambient for [icfg_icnt]'s reason verbatim. *)

(* ---- THE TWO BOOT LITERALS (iclaim-ledger.md §2.2/§2.3, increment IIIa) ---

   [icfg_alloc] hands the ledger's two per-inum maps over as ARGUMENTS ([LM]
   and [CM]), because their contents are a fact about the boot state that
   [IcacheRef] knows nothing about.  These are the values a boot client
   actually passes, and the two [_split] lemmas below (in [Section
   IcacheLink], where the ambient gnames are in scope) are what turn the raw
   [own] back into the per-inum fragments [IcacheBoot] and [InodeRegion]
   demand.  Keyed by an arbitrary [P : gset Z] rather than by
   [IcacheEscrow.region_inums] because that set is defined ABOVE this file;
   the boot client instantiates [P := region_inums nib].

   THE COUNT MAP is one WHOLE element per inum at zero -- "no inode is cached
   at boot" -- which [icnt_split] then cuts into the region's half and the
   free pool's half (§2.2, as amended by increment II: the uncached halves
   ride the POOL, not [islot_empty]).

   THE LINK MAP is the all-plain authority every landed boot lemma already
   names, WITH ITS f-COLUMN FRAGMENT CO-RESIDENT: [● a ⋅ ◯ a] at
   [a = lelemf 0 .. (Some (Excl FrzOff))].  The auth half is [ireg_alloc]'s
   premise (it already says [Some (Excl FrzOff)] since increment I); the
   fragment half is [ifreeze_off z], the "right to freeze" that increment
   IIIa parks in the free pool.  Nothing else in the element is fragmented:
   every other column starts at its unit, so [◯ a] is exactly the f token
   and no w/c/r/p fragment escapes at boot. *)

(* [DepFrz] (iclaim-ledger.md IVd) is the FREE PATH'S window, iput
   +0x5e..+0x70, and it is a descriptor precisely because a descriptor is
   "what the arm is holding": here that is a reference MINUS its two live
   slices, which the mint parked in [islot2]'s frozen park and which must
   stay there for the whole lock-free span.  It therefore names no
   generation -- there is no [live_gen] in the arm to pin -- and
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_dep_res] is [False] on it, exactly as on [DepNone]:
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_out]'s SECOND alternative is what such an arm holds
   ([ic_out_frz]).

   IT IS A CONSTRUCTOR AND NOT [DepNone] because the fractions have to be
   NAMED.  The freer takes its count fragment and its identity slice back at
   the +0x70 park and needs them at exactly the [q] it deposited them at (the
   eviction at +0x8a rebuilds [iref_tok k q] beside a sleeplock share that
   releasesleep returned at [q], and [iref_frag] cannot be split -- two

     escrow payloads, so a threaded name would enter [ireg_inv] AND
     the pool row -- i.e. [ic_escrow]'s arity, i.e. every fs

     iupdate that wrote it" -- lives in [InodeRegion.ireg_slot]'s body, and
     it names a [log_names], an [inodestart] and one [mono_nat] per inum.
     None of the three can be threaded: [ireg_slot] is reached through
     [ireg_inv], whose arity is fixed by 30-odd fs contracts, and §G.14/§G.16
     showed that a tie carried in a BODY existential admits no agreement
     with a consumer's own γ.  Ambient, exactly as [icfg_iref] and

     pure premise [⌜γ = icfg_log⌝] on the three contracts that mix a
     threaded γ with the region (the mint, the deposit and G-3's crz) -- and
     it is true at boot by construction, [icfg_alloc] returning the
     equation.

     [icfg_iep] is a FAMILY over the inum's value rather than one gname
     because each inum's counter must move independently; it is keyed by the

     zero lets [iput] take the lock without blocking -- see

(* ALLOCATING ONE, for a boot that wants to CREATE the authority rather
   than assume it: the class is inhabited at any device and region size,
   with the count authority freshly minted at the empty table.  This is
   what [IcacheBoot.icache_boot] takes as its authority premise, and it is
   what makes that premise demonstrably satisfiable rather than vacuous.
   (Nothing in the boot chain calls it yet: [FileInv.fileG] carries an
   ambient [icfg], so the file table's payload is stated over THAT one, and
   tying the two together is the remaining half of the boot wiring.)

   THE LEDGER'S BOOT MAP IS AN ARGUMENT (design §20.6's boot row).  Its
   contents are a fact about the mkfs IMAGE -- one authority per inum, at
   the count of live records naming it -- which this file knows nothing
   about, and a gname is only usable by [IcacheBoot] if the very
   [own_alloc] that mints it also mints the map.  So the caller supplies
   [LM] and its validity, and gets the ledger back at the class's own
   [icfg_link]. *)

  (* [ireg_boot] is the EXCLUSIVE pre-userspace token: while it is held no
     [ireg_open] can exist ([ity_pending_shot_excl]).  It is minted by
     [icfg_alloc] and carried on the boot thread through fsinit into ireclaim.
     [ireg_open] is the PERSISTENT sealed regime, parked in every
     [InodeRegion.ireg_slot] beside the slot's claim component: a claimed slot
     (c = Some) must exhibit it, so a holder of [ireg_boot] proves every slot
     is unclaimed ([IregLinkNz.ireg_boot_no_claim]).  The seal
     [ireg_boot ==∗ ireg_open] ([ity_shoot]) fires once after fsinit returns;
     that firing is OWED to forkret's first branch. *)

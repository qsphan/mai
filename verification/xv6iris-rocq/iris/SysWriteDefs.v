(* SysWriteDefs.v -- THE WRITE DELTA'S PURE VOCABULARY: the chunk
   constant, the per-chunk side conditions, the chained reading and the
   instant-count bound.  A LEAF: pure Coq, no [iProp], no [Module Type],
   no contract.

   WHY THE WRITE'S CONSTANTS LIVE IN A LEAF OF THEIR OWN.  Both the
   INVARIANT layer ([FsAbsWriteFire.v], the fire point) and the CONTRACT
   ([SpecFilewrite.v]) need [FW_MAX] and [wchunks], and a spec file may not
   own a definition the invariant layer needs
   (design/code-organization.md), so they sit here, below both.  [FW_MAX]'s
   derivation from the log's budget stays in [SpecFilewrite.fw_max_value],
   where [MAXOPBLOCKS] is in scope.

   sys_write itself has ONE contract, [SpecSysWrite.SYSWRITE], whose arms
   are keyed on the descriptor's state; the abstract commits it is stated
   over are [FsAbsWriteFire]'s, at the γtop AUTHORITY (an [FsAbs.astate]-
   shaped commit is not dischargeable in either phase -- that file's header
   is the argument).

   (the last possibly short).  [wchunks] is that ceiling; it sizes the
   commit bundle.  [wchunks_covers] is the non-vacuity fact -- the bundle
   is big enough for the count -- and [wchunks_nonpos] the degenerate
   arms' (nothing to hand in when the count is not positive).

   1c.  THE CHUNK AT ONE NODE -- RELAY 3 (lane WRITE-RELAY)

   [wchunks n] says HOW MANY instants can fire; [wchunk_at n k] says how
   BIG the one at node [k] is.  filewrite's loop computes it in two
   instructions ([subw a5,s5,s4] then the [FW_MAX] cap), and every chunk
   that reaches node [k] was FULL -- a short one breaks the loop -- so the
   loop's running offset at node [k] is [FW_MAX * k] and the count it
   passes writei is [min (n - FW_MAX*k) FW_MAX].

   WHY THE NODE NEEDS IT.  [SpecCopyin.ubytes_at M ua bs] is a [∀] over
   [bs]'s OWN indices and is therefore PREFIX-CLOSED: it says "these bytes
   are a run of the caller's image at this base", never "this is the whole
   chunk".  So a client that knows which bytes it asked to have written
   cannot identify the fire's [bs] with them from the content tie alone --
   it needs the LENGTH, and the length is the one thing the kernel holds
   for free at the fire (it is the number it passed writei).  With the two
   together the identification is [ubytes_at_inj]'s one line.  (F-WRITE
   finding 2; design/app-file.md section 3, RELAY 3.) *)
Definition wchunk_at (n : Z) (k : nat) : Z :=
  Z.min (n - FW_MAX * Z.of_nat k) FW_MAX.

(* THE LOOP'S OWN CHUNK IS THIS ONE.  [ProofFilewrite.fw_test] hands the
   body [0 < c <= FW_MAX], [c <= n - t] and -- the clause lane E2-W added
   for exactly this kind of reasoning -- [c = n - t \/ c = FW_MAX].  With
   the loop's tie [t = FW_MAX * k] that pins [c] outright. *)

(* writei's DISTURBED TAIL exists for exactly one reason: [either_copyin]
   gave up part-way on the USER arm, having already written a prefix of the
   chunk into the block it had [bread] (kernel defect D1's fix commits that
   block rather than stranding it).  copyin's only failing test is
   walkaddr's, taken again after vmfault declined, so the byte it died on is
   an address of the SOURCE run the process's page table does not map for
   READING -- [uva_rmapped] (present and V&U) and NOT [uva_wmapped]: there
   is no PTE_R re-walk on this side ([SpecCopyin.copyin_read]'s -1 arm
   states it, and [SpecEitherCopyin.either_copyin_post] relays it).

   THE EXACT TWIN of [SysReadDefs.rd_fail_why], one test weaker, and it is
   read the same way: STATED AT THE ENTRY DESCRIPTOR [P], which is the
   WEAKER and therefore usable form -- the round's table only GREW
   ([uptd_ext_sz]) and a byte the entry table can read the grown one can
   read too ([UserPtTree.uva_rmapped_mono]), so [wr_nrmapped_entry] below is
   how a proof brings the round's verdict back to the entry.

   WHICH byte is EXISTENTIAL and the bound is the REQUEST: copyin walks
   whole pages, so the failing round may have copied a prefix of its own
   chunk first, and all the caller is promised is that the bad byte is
   inside the run it asked for.  That is enough: a caller whose whole source
   run is readable-mapped refutes the arm outright ([wr_fail_why_refute]),
   which is what [UkRunSys.usrc_ok]'s second conjunct buys the U tier.

(* SpecBfree.v -- the public interface of bfree, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     static void bfree(int dev, uint b) {
       struct buf *bp;
       int bi, m;

       bp = bread(dev, BBLOCK(b, sb));
       bi = b % BPB;
       m = 1 << (bi % 8);
       if((bp->data[bi/8] & m) == 0)
         panic("freeing free block");
       bp->data[bi/8] &= ~m;
       log_write(bp);
       brelse(bp);
     }

   108 bytes, 35 instructions, straight-line apart from the one panic arm.
   [bi] is computed as [(b << 51) >> 54], i.e. [(b mod BPB) / 8] fused with
   the byte index; [m] as [1 << (b & 7)]; the clear as [xori -1] + [and].

   THE CONTRACT (claude-notes/design/fs-bitmap.md).  bfree consumes the
   freed block's EXCLUSIVE byte run and returns it to the FREE POOL,
   clearing bit [b] of the bitmap block.  The pool and the bitmap block live
   in the persistent [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv]; the block goes back in at
   log_write's own ghost step ([BitmapInv.bitmap_free_au]), so the contract
   names no bitmap set.

   THE PANIC IS DEAD, and the bitmap invariant is what kills it.  The
   caller arrives holding block [b]'s byte run, which is EXCLUSIVE, while
   the free pool holds the run of every block below [size] whose bit is
   CLEAR.  So if bit [b] were clear there would be two owners of one
   block's bytes, which is absurd ([FsStateBitmap.free_pool_used]).  The bit
   is therefore set,
   [bp->data[bi/8] & m] is nonzero ([BitmapEnc.bm_bit_test]), and the
   branch at +0x3a is not taken.  Refuting this panic is the main thing the
   invariant has to buy; the contract still takes the panic credentials
   because bread's own interior panic arm wants them.

   ONE BITMAP BLOCK.  [FSSIZE = 2000 < BPB = 8192], so [size <= BPB] is a
   premise and [BBLOCK b sb = sb.bmapstart] outright
   ([BitmapInv.BBLOCK_single]).  bfree's [srliw a5,a1,0xd] then contributes
   zero and its [(b << 51) >> 54] is just [b / 8].

   THE BUDGET IS SPEND-EXACTLY: [log_op γ (S u)] in, [log_op γ u] out.
   bfree is straight-line and always executes its one log_write, so unlike
   bmap it can promise this (the spend-at-most form is forced only where a
   path can skip the spend).

   TWO SLOT UNITS, in and back out: bread's reference is held across
   log_write, which wants one of its own; brelse gives it back.

   [sb.bmapstart] rides as a plain FRACTIONAL cell, the way SpecInitlog.v
   takes [sb + 20] and SpecIupdate.v takes [sb + 24].  bfree does NOT read
   [sb.size] (only balloc does), so no [sb_size] cell appears here.

   bfree SLEEPS (bread), so it threads the full running-process bundle
   exactly as SpecIupdate.v / SpecBread.v do.  It enters and returns at
   noff 0. *)

(* SpecSched.v -- the public interface of Sched, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

   sched() parks the current process: entered holding EXACTLY p->lock
   (noff == 1, interrupts off, saved base enable [eb] ARBITRARY -- see the
   premise block below; a thread parked from kerneltrap has [eb = false]),
   with the
   process's state already moved to a parked state (yield sets RUNNABLE,
   sleep sets SLEEPING -- [needs_ctx st]).  It swtches into this CPU's
   scheduler context, handing over the held lock, the state/chan cells, the
   trap CSRs and the per-CPU cells (the p_sched chain payload, SchedCtx.v).

   IT DOES NOT RETURN ON THE HART IT PARKED FROM.  Proc contexts are
   MIGRATABLE ([ctx_adm = None], SwtchCtx.v): any hart's scheduler may
   dispatch this process, swtch does not save tp, and the resumed thread
   inherits the resuming hart's.  So the continuation is wrapped in
   [wp_next b], whose rebound [CID] IS the resuming hart -- every resource
   it receives resolves at that hart automatically (no [(CID := h)]
   annotation, no separate ghost-name binder: the SIE ghost is canonical per
   hart now), and its conclusion is the plain [mWP (Loop)] at the rebound
   [CID].  sched always swtches (there is no non-parking path), so the proof
   establishes the fully hart-generic postcondition regardless of [b] and
   discharges the wrapper via [wp_next_intro] for whichever index a caller
   supplies; sched's OWN [sie_cap_gpr]/[cpu_own] resource index stays the
   literal [false] throughout (entered at noff == 1, and [cpu_own]'s
   [b = true] arm demands noff == 0) -- a second, DISTINCT index from
   [wp_next]'s own [b] (see explicit-cpuid-porting-guide.md, "two different
   indices").  The register postcondition weakens to [callee_saved m mf]
   (CalleeSaved.v's tp-free relation); the old <the tp conjunct, now deleted: tp_pin makes it true by construction>
   conjunct is gone -- [tp_pin] makes it true by construction.

   What the continuation gets back: same j, state now RUNNING, lock held on
   the resumed hart, that hart's fresh trap CSRs (the dispatch payload's,
   [intr_res] included, which is what a caller's own release/retune needs
   under the fresh ghost), c->proc back at proc j,
   and a FRESH parked scheduler context under ▷ ([sched_vc], which resolves
   at the rebound hart the same way). *)

     swtch happens, and the slot needs them: they are part of the page the
     dying thread has to leave behind ([ProcDefs.kstack_free]).  So sched
     hands them to the payload instead of carrying them into a continuation

(* sched() panics ("sched locks") unless [mycpu()->noff == 1], and this file
   used to publish a SECOND contract, [wp_sched_locks], entered at
   noff >= 2: it took the branch, jumped to panic and consumed the caller's
   a panic credential.  It existed for exactly one client -- the LOCKED branch of
   a NESTED [acquiresleep], through [SpecSleep.wp_sleep_nested] -- and that
   client is gone: iput now takes [SpecAcquiresleep.wp_acquiresleep_nb_sconf],
   which PROVES it does not sleep (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md).
   The contract is deleted rather than left standing as an unused permission
   to panic.

   WHAT IS LEFT IS A REFUTATION.  [wp_sched_sconf] is now sched's ONLY
   contract.  It demands [cpu_own 1] and takes NO panic credential, and its
   proof discharges the [bne] at sched+0x30 from the level alone.  So no
   proof in this tree can hand a WP to sched's entry PC at any level but 1,
   and along the one it can hand, the panic's basic block is not reached --
   nor are the three [unreachable()] checks around it (p->lock held,
   state <> RUNNING, interrupts off), which the same contract refutes from
   [proc_held], [park_ok st] and the entry index [false].  All four of
   sched's failure exits are dead code in the verified kernel. *)

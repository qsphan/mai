(* FsBlocks.v -- the block layer's two content maps, and the log layer's
   instantiation of the bio layer's client view (bio_view).

   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-log.md, section "The ghost state".

   THERE ARE TWO CONTENT MAPS, and which one a resource is a share of is
   the whole distinction between "what the buffer cache believes" and
   "what the file system owns".

   - [fs_cache] -- the bio-side block CACHE map C, keyed by BLOCK number,
     values whole-block byte lists.  Its AUTH lives in the log lock's
     resource ([LogInv.log_state]), which is the freeze: during commit the
     committer owns the auth outright, so C cannot move and "log slot i
     holds C(W[i])" carries from write_log through install_trans.  Each
     covered block's element is split half/half: the MACHINERY half rides
     inside the bio layer (pool -> escrow -> handle) as the payloads
     [fs_mclean]/[fs_mdirty] below, and the PARKED half is [fs_chalf].
     Two halves agree with no auth in sight; UPDATING needs the auth plus
     both halves, so log_write (under log.lock) and the committer are the
     only writers of C.

   - the LOGGED VIEW L, keyed by BYTE ADDRESS -- section [FsBytes] at the
     bottom of this file.  [byte_range] / [fsblock] are runs of FULL,
     therefore EXCLUSIVE, ghost_map elements, which is what lets the layer
     above own a SUB-BLOCK object and why bio may hold no share of this
     map at all.  The two maps are tied inside [fs_bytes_inv] (namespace
     [logN]), which is also where the home blocks' PARKED cache halves
     live.

   - [fs_dirty]: is the block in the current pinned write set
     (logged-uncommitted-or-uninstalled)?  Half in the payload, half (plus
     the auth) in the log lock's resource, recording exactly the membership
     of lh.block[].  Flipped false->true by log_write, true->false by
     install_trans at its bunpin.

   The bio payloads: clean = cache-half + dirty-half-at-false; dirty =
   cache-half + dirty-half-at-true.  Bio moves them opaquely; only holders
   of the cache auth convert.

   THERE IS NO PER-BLOCK OWNERSHIP TOKEN.  There used to be one ([fs_own]
   / [blk_own], a unit-valued ghost map at FULL fraction), because the
   client resource was the block-keyed HALF [fs_chalf] -- two holders of a
   half at one key are perfectly consistent, so no amount of [fs_chalf]
   reasoning said a block was unowned.  The byte view below is EXCLUSIVE,
   so [fsblock_excl] does that job directly and the token was pure
   duplication: the inode block map's injectivity, bfree's "freeing a free
   block" panic refutation and the icache escrow's block tokens are all
   readings of "two owners of one block's bytes is [False]".  The one thing
   the token could say that [fsblock] cannot -- naming a block whose
   CONTENT nobody has committed to -- is what [FsStateBitmap.free_bitmap_at]
   says instead, existentially, for exactly the free pool's members
   (fs-state.md section 2). *)

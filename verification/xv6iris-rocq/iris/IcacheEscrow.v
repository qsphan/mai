(* IcacheEscrow.v -- THE INODE ENTRY'S ESCROW, AND THE UNCACHED POOL.
   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md §13 (which supersedes §10 and
   §12.5 where they disagree).  Modelled line-by-line on BioInv.v's buffer
   escrow; every shape below has a named counterpart there.

   ---- WHY AN ESCROW AT ALL --------------------------------------------

   Same two facts as bio's, transposed to inodes:

   (1) A releasing holder's content must be reachable from the sleeplock
       side BY THE END of [iunlock] -- a blocked waiter's [acquiresleep] can
       return before the releaser has done anything else.
   (2) [iget]'s recycle rewrites dev / inum / ref / valid under only
       [itable.lock], and its scan reads every entry's dev/inum there -- so
       those cells sit fully inside neither the sleeplock chain nor the
       table's resource.

   ---- THE FIVE ARMS (§13.1c, §13.8/13.9, §13.13) -----------------------

     PARKED : the traveling content, waiting for whoever wins the sleeplock.
              [i_valid] FULL, keyed by a bool that selects the payload's
              shape (loaded / unloaded); BOTH identity cells at HALF
              (§13.1e).  The [i_inum] half is what ties the payload's
              [dinode_at] to the inum the identity cells name (§13.1b); the
              [i_dev] half exists because a checked-out thread has deposited
              its WHOLE reference and would otherwise have no way to read
              [ip->dev] (ilock's own bread, at ilock+0x48) or to get its
              reference back AT ITS OWN DEVICE (iunlock's postcondition).
              [BioInv.buf_parked] holds [b_dev ↦₄{½}] for the same two
              reasons.  Plus the recycle token.
     EMPTY  : the arm of a slot that is NOT live (§13.8/§13.9) -- the boot
              state of all fifty entries, and what iput's last close leaves
              behind.  NO payload: no bundle and no [dinode_at], the record
              having gone back to the pool.  The DEV cell is FULL here, and
              that is the discriminator every reference-holding opener uses;
              the inum cell stays at ½ so that FULL-inum remains MID's
              signature alone.
     OUT    : checked out by a sleeplock chain -- the chain's DEPOSIT, half of
              the checkout descriptor and the recycle token wait here until the
              parker brings the content back.  The deposit is a REFERENCE
              (iput's authority-side window exit) or a SHARE (ilock's checkout
              under SpecIlock v3), and WHICH is what the descriptor says: with
              two shapes in one arm the two parkers are otherwise
              resource-indistinguishable, so each holds the descriptor's other
              half and selects its own arm by [ghost_var_agree] (§14.8).
     MID    : iget's recycle window [+0x72, +0x7c): the inum cell already
              names the NEW inode and the payload is already the incoming
              unloaded bundle, but the valid word is still STALE, so the
              arm's valid<->shape coupling cannot be stated.  The inum cell
              is FULL here (the recycler joined the table's half in at the
              store and keeps it across the window) and the recycle token is
              OUT, in the recycler's hand.  The DEV cell stays at HALF here
              exactly as in PARKED: the inum cell remains the sole
              parked/mid discriminator, and the dev store at +0x6e is its
              own open/close pair over the PARKED arm
              ([ic_open_empty_dev]), not part of this window --
              nothing couples the arm's dev to its payload, so a parked arm
              whose dev already names the incoming inode is well formed.
     HELD   : iput's AUTHORITY-SIDE window [+0x3c, the post-acquiresleep
              checkout) -- design §13.13.  Same idea as MID, for the other
              function and in the other direction: the CELLS stay in the arm
              (dev ½ as always, inum FULL -- the same discriminator MID uses
              -- and HALF the valid word, the holder keeping the other half
              so the polarity stays pinned by agreement) while the PAYLOAD
              LEAVES WITH THE HOLDER, at the concrete polarity the holder
              observed.  That is the whole content of the arm: iput reads
              [ip->valid] at +0x3c and cannot use the answer twenty bytes
              later, because [ic_open_auth_ref] re-seals the parked arm with
              its [v] existentially bound and NOTHING an itable-lock holder
              owns can pin it ([valid]'s writer, ilock, holds no itable
              credential, so a table-anchored ghost half would have no
              partner).  Taking the payload out of the invariant removes the
              question: a resource in the holder's own context is not
              re-bound by anything.

   Refutations, and which opener uses which (§10.3, §13.1c, §13.13):

     * the sleeplock winner (post-[acquiresleep]) refutes OUT with its own
       [ic_tok], and MID with its reference's inum-cell FRACTION against
       MID's FULL inum cell;
     * the parker ([iunlock]) refutes PARKED and MID with the FULL valid
       cell it is carrying (both arms hold that cell full);
     * iget's recycle, which arrives at a slot the table shows NOT LIVE,
       refutes all three of PARKED / OUT / MID with the table's [false] half
       of the identification ghost -- it has no cell fraction to reason with,
       because the empty arm owns the whole dev cell (§13.8/§13.9);
     * an authority-side opener at REF-1 (iput) refutes OUT by
       [IcacheInv.iref_tok_two_lookup] -- its own reference plus the arm's
       would make the count at least two -- and MID by its own inum
       fraction;
     * the recycler re-opening its own window refutes PARKED and OUT with
       [ic_mid], which both of them hold and it is carrying;
     * HELD is refuted by every one of the above with the line it already
       uses: the sleeplock winner and the REF-1 opener by their inum
       FRACTION against HELD's FULL cell (the MID line, verbatim), the
       parker and [ic_open_out] by their FULL valid cell, the recycler by
       [ic_mid] (HELD parks it, exactly as PARKED does), and iget's arrival
       at a not-live slot by the identification ghost;
     * ...and HELD's own re-opener -- iput -- needs NO NEW TOKEN, which is
       why none was added (§13.13 wrote one down as an option; the compile
       settles it, and it is not needed).  Its credential is REF-1 PLUS THE
       PAYLOAD, and each part kills one arm: the authority half at count one
       against its own [iref_tok] kills OUT ([iref_tok_two_lookup], the line
       [ic_open_auth_ref] already uses) and is what makes the credential
       exclusive -- no second thread holds a reference to this slot at all;
       the PAYLOAD it is carrying kills PARKED and MID, because every payload
       owns this ENTRY's metadata cells and those are exclusive
       ([ic_payload_excl]; before §16.4 this went through the payload's
       [dinode_at], which the slimmed free arm no longer has -- and the cells
       are slot-keyed, so no [ic_id_agree] is needed to pin the inums first);
       and the table's [ic_id] half at [true] kills EMPTY.  REF-1
       rather than [ic_tok] is FORCED, not chosen: iput must also be able to
       UNDO the window at +0x44, when [ip->nlink] is nonzero and no
       [acquiresleep] has run.  Putting a
       fresh token in the four other arms instead would have forced
       [ic_mid_arm] to carry it, which is [ProofIget]'s inline arm
       construction at +0x72 and its destructuring at +0x7c -- i.e. it would
       have broken the "no proof file moves" requirement for the sake of a
       refutation that is already available.

   The ½-versus-FULL split of the inum cell IS the parked/mid
   discriminator, which is why §13.1b's identity re-budget in
   [IcacheInv.islot_rest] is not bookkeeping.  HELD shares that signature
   deliberately -- no opener has to tell HELD from MID except iput, which
   does it with the payload, and MID/HELD are told apart by [ic_mid]
   (HELD parks it, MID does not).

   ---- ONE DEVIATION FROM THE C3a BRIEF, RECORDED HERE ------------------

   The brief described [ic_swap_checkout] as splitting the winner's
   reference in half -- q/2 deposited into OUT, q/2 kept.  THAT IS NOT AN
   ENTAILMENT: [iref_tok k q] is [own icfg_iref (◯ {[k := (q,1)]})] and two
   half-fraction tokens compose to [{[k := (q,2)]}], a different element, so
   splitting a reference's FRACTION also splits its COUNT and needs the
   authority (that is exactly [iref_dup_step], which is idup's shape and
   needs a lock the winner does not hold).  §13.1c's arm table is what is
   transcribed instead, verbatim: OUT holds a WHOLE [inode_ref], the winner
   deposits its reference on checkout and gets it back at the park --
   BioInv's [escrow_swap_checkout] / [escrow_swap_park] exactly.  A winner
   that needs a reference fragment MID-CRITICAL-SECTION (iunlock's lock-free
   [ip->ref] read at its panic guard) borrows it from the arm through
   [ic_open_out], which is what that lemma is for.

   ---- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE ------------------------------------

   No function contract and no instruction step: iget / ilock / iunlock /
   iput are stated over this file, not in it.  The recycler's payload
   juggling (turning an evicted entry's parked payload back into a pool
   entry) is iget's obligation and is NOT baked into a swap lemma here --
   see the [ic_open_parked_free] / [ic_close_mid] comment.               *)

     (None, None) arm carries [false], the live arm carries [true]).

     It is NOT monotone (§13.9): iget's recycle flips it false->true and
     iput's LAST CLOSE flips it back, because a non-live slot's bundle goes
     home to the pool rather than staying cached.

     It exists for exactly one opener.  Every other refutation in this file
     is a cell fraction or an exclusive token that the opener already holds:
     a reference holder kills the empty arm with its DEV fraction against
     that arm's full cell, the parker kills it with its full valid cell, the
     recycler re-opening its window kills it with [ic_mid].  But the recycler
     ARRIVING at a non-live slot holds no dev fraction at all -- the empty
     arm owns the whole cell, which is the point -- and so cannot tell that
     arm from an ordinary parked one.  This is what it reads instead.

     It is not a lock: both halves live in resources their holders already
     own, and the two flips happen at the one opening where both are in one
     hand -- iget's recycle and iput's last close.  Not
     [lock_tok_excl] (FsCrash.v's route out of the same problem): BOTH sides
     must be able to READ the state, and an exclusive token can be held by
     only one of them. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* ONE UNCACHED INUM'S POOL BUNDLE (§13.3, slimmed by §16.4).  Two shapes,
     because free inodes exist: [inode_ok] demands a nonzero type, and a
     type-0 inode owns no blocks (itrunc returned them).

     THE FREE ARM IS NOW A BARE MARKER (§16.3/§16.4).  It used to carry the
     inum's [dinode_at]; ialloc cannot reach it there, because the pool is
     behind the itable spinlock and the claim is serialised by the BUFFER
     instead (§16.1/§16.2).  So a free inum's record fragment lives in
     [InodeRegion]'s invariant and what the pool holds is
     [InodeRegion.imark] -- the per-inum token whose other home is that same
     invariant's OUT arm.  It is not decoration: it is exactly what makes
     ilock's fill able to conclude that a nonzero type at a marker-parked
     entry means the fragment is still in the region
     ([InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw]).

     THE DIRECTORY-WF CONJUNCT (§15(a)).  The allocated arm also carries
     [DirView.dir_ok icfg_nib] -- if this inode is a DIRECTORY then every
     live record in it names an inum the inode region covers.  It rides
     beside [inode_ok] rather than inside it because [inode_ok]'s signature
     has no [nib] and its users are legion; [icfg_nib] is the ambient
     region size, capacity and not resource.  The FREE arm needs no such
     conjunct: it carries no data at all, and its type is 0.

     ...AND ITS RESOURCE TWIN (§20.3, stage B; since G6 the TYPE REGISTER).
     [dlinks] rides BESIDE [dir_ok], not inside it: one type-register
     fragment per live non-self record (fs-state.md §6½).  [dir_ok] says the
     named inum is IN RANGE; the twin says it is ALLOCATED and reveals its
     TYPE, which is a fact about another inum's REGION record and therefore
     cannot be a [Prop] over [data] (§20.1, §20.9(a)).  It is timeless, so
     the [Timeless] instance below survives verbatim.  (Through G5 the
     conjunct was the one the old flavoured link ledger carried
     beside it; G6 deleted the ledger.)

     ...AND THE ".." INDEX CLAUSE (fs-icache §20.17.4, fs-fragments R9).
     [DirView.dir_dots_ix]: a LIVE directory ([T_DIR] and [nlink <> 0]) has
     at least two records and its record 1 is the live [".."].  It is what
     lets S7 name the one entry unit at [dp] it must convert -- an entry's
     unit is keyed by record INDEX and is name-blind, so without it nothing
     says WHICH unit in a child's [dlinks] is the parent's.  It rides HERE,
     beside [dir_ok], for [dir_ok]'s own reason: it is a fact about this
     payload's bytes that no contract in the tree wants to carry, and the
     [Timeless] instances below are unaffected because it is pure.

     ...AND ITS COMPLEMENT, [DirView.dir_orphan_clean] (the STRONG isdirempty
     invariant, fs-fragments F1.5d's plank).  [dir_dots_ix] speaks only above
     [nlink <> 0]; this one speaks only at [nlink = 0], and between them the
     directory case is partitioned with no overlap and no gap: an ORPHANED
     directory's live records are exactly ["."] and [".."].  It is true of
     THIS binary because sys_link's orphan guard (xv6 f60ff58, ARM E2)
     refuses to [dirlink] into a directory whose count has already fallen to
     zero, and it carries three loads at once -- fs-icache §20.6's itrunc
     row, §20.17.5's residue, and [sys_unlink]'s own input premise, since a
     live NON-dot record under it forces the home's count nonzero, which is
     what [FsStateEra.ent_toks_era_unlink] needs of the home. *)
  (* ...AND ITS OWNERSHIP IS THE ERA BUNDLE (durable-disk 2b-inode-3).
     The three RESOURCE conjuncts [dinode_at] / [ind_res] / [inode_blocks]
     are gone; what stands in their place is
     [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era] at this arm's own node, which CONTAINS all
     three and carries the era's abstract value ([FsState.top_frag]) beside
     them.  [IcacheBoot.ipool_shape_alloc] assembles it and
     [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era_era_node_to] takes it apart, both off
     [inode_ok]'s own representational half ([FsStateEra.node_shape_ok]).

     [inode_ok] STAYS A PURE CONJUNCT, and that is a deliberate deviation
     from 2b-inode-2's plan (which had it derived on demand by
     [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era_era_node_ok], a fupd at [logN]).  It costs
     nothing -- every producer proved it before the flip and still does --
     and it is what keeps the flip from moving a single consumer's MASK:
     with it, [ic_loaded_open] is an ordinary entailment, so no walk has to
     find a [logN]-open window at the point where it unpacks its payload,
     and no arm that unpacks inside an [iInv] becomes unprovable.  The
     derivation is landed and is what an arm that would rather NOT maintain
     the coverage sweep or the injectivity uses. *)
  (* ---- THE LINKS CONJUNCT (durable-disk G6: THE OLD LEDGER IS GONE) --

     The payload's links half is the TYPE REGISTER's fragments
     ([FsStateInode.ent_toks] at this payload's own node; fs-state.md
     §6½): one per entry of this directory that names another inum, drawn
     out of that inum's region-side authority at the [iupdate] that raised
     its count.  Through 2b-inode-5..G5 it rode BESIDE the old flavoured
     flavoured link ledger, so that the ~forty payload sites which
     only pass the conjunct through never moved; G6 deleted that first
     conjunct and the payloads keep their arity again.

     The form is the DEPOSIT-TIME [FsStateInode.ent_toks_x]: the marker set
     is existential and the per-directory count is EXACT, which is where
     [ProofSysUnlinkPure]'s (D2) reads "a directory holding a live subdirectory
     record has at least two links".  A checked-out walk OPENS it --
     [dlinks_open] names the marker set -- moves entries and counts freely,
     and re-seals at [dlinks_intro] with the equation restored.  create's
     mkdir arm is exactly the window that needs the freedom: it appends
     [dp]'s record for the child and raises [dp->nlink] at two different
     instructions. *)

     its four parts in three hands:

       - the RECORD's bytes and this inum's link AUTHORITY are region-side
         ([InodeRegion.ireg_recs] at [FsStateInode.rec_owned_at],
         [InodeRegion.ireg_lnk_at] around [FsStateLink.link_auth]) and never

       - the DATA LEG -- [FsStateInode.inode_dat_q], which is [inode_phi]
         MINUS its record -- and this inode's entry TOKENS
         ([FsStateInode.ent_toks_x], the Φ-free half's other piece) are
         HERE, in whichever escrow arm or pool row owns the inum;
       - the era's own two, the record PROXY [dinode_at] and the abstract
         fragment [FsState.top_frag], ride with the leg and are RESIDUE to
         the collection, which consumes neither.

     So the pair is what every arm carries and what [ic_slot_cover]'s third

     it off a slot without re-associating anything.  The three readings

     [ic_inode_leg_owned] -- are the whole of the translation into the

  (* THE AWAIT ARM (iclaim-ledger.md §1.2/§1.3): the entry a FREER has parked
     on its way to the off-lock deposit.  It is the whole point of B2's
     resolution that it does NOT contain [dinode_at] -- the freer keeps the
     record, with its identity intact and no existential, all the way to
     [OFF.ip_free_offlock]'s entry.  What it carries instead is the escrow the
     freer minted ([EscrowInode.escA_alloc], mask-only) and that escrow's
     exclusive redemption ticket, i.e. exactly [pool_pending] MINUS the
     [committedA] the deposit has not yet produced.

     ...AND THE FREEZE, which §1.2 does not name and which is here for §1.3's
     sake.  §1.3 requires a pre-deposit consumer -- a fill or a recycle of
     THIS inum -- to be refutable, and the refutation the design gives is
     §2.6's exclusivity, not an arithmetic one.  Parking the freer's
     [ifreeze_post] here is what makes it a two-line refutation
     ([IcacheRef.ifreeze_excl]) against the "right to freeze" [ifreeze_off]
     that the consumer must present: one exclusive cell, two holders.  The
     cost is that §1.4's retire (f Some -> None) reads the token back out of
     the POOL at the await-redeem rather than out of the depositor's hand; the
     pin it carries ([FrzPost => icnt = 0], InodeRegion.ireg_frz_ok) is
     undisturbed across the wider window, because the inum is uncached
     throughout it.

     WHERE IT SITS, AND WHY THAT IS A DEVIATION FROM §1.2 (recorded).  §1.2
     puts the arm inside [ipool_shape_np].  It cannot go there: [escA_inv] is
     an [inv] and therefore not Timeless, [ipool_shape_np] is what
     [ic_unloaded] wraps, and [ic_unloaded_timeless] is what
     [ic_escrow_body_timeless] -- hence every [iInv "Hesc" as ">"] in the tree
     -- is built out of.  This is EscrowDefs' own trade, made there for the
     region and quoted at [region_pending]: "[esc_inv] (not Timeless) rides
     the POOL side, so this stays Timeless".  So the await arm rides the pool
     side too, beside [pool_pending], and §1.2's park at iput+0x70 needs a
     Timeless stand-in of its own (the A-walk's item, not this increment's). *)
  (* A⁗ (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16) DROPPED THE [ifreeze_post] CONJUNCT, and
     IIIa's DEVIATION 3 is superseded.  §1.3's original design put the
     refutation of a pre-deposit consumer on the CALLER's licence
     ([iname_not_frozen], landed IIIc) rather than on a token parked here,
     and that is now buildable -- while the token is NOT parkable any more:
     the phase fragment has to stay in the FREER's hand from the mint at
     +0x50 to the off-lock deposit at +0xba, because it is what decides the
     escrow arm's tail at +0x70 and +0x8a ([ic_payload_arm_decide_frz]) and
     what [IcacheInv.iref_close_last_freeze_store_au] consumes in between.
     One exclusive ledger cell cannot be in two places. *)

  (* the PENDING-capable pool shape -- lives ONLY at the itable free pool,
     which is LOCK-HELD (never [iInv .. as ">"], verified), so the non-Timeless
     [pool_pending] (an [esc_inv]) is fine here.  A pending entry has disk
     type=0 and is provably never filled ([ireg_withdraw] needs type<>0), hence
     never enters the escrow's [ipool_shape_np] side.  Since §1.2 the AWAIT arm
     rides here for the same reason and with the same consequence.

     ---- THE UNCACHED LEDGER RESOURCES (increment IIIa) ------------------

     THE COUNT HALF, at the bundle level and above the arms.  §2.2 puts one
     [icnt] half in [InodeRegion.ireg_slot] and the other wherever the inum's
     identity is parked; increment II proved the "not-cached arms" reading of
     that ruling FALSE at [islot_empty] (fifty slots, one key: fraction 25)
     and deferred the true home to here.  This IS the true home: the pool's
     domain is [region_inums nib ∖ ci_inums ci], i.e. exactly the complement
     of the live arms' inums, so one half per POOL ENTRY is one half per
     UNCACHED inum, which is what the fraction discipline demands.  The value
     is the literal 0: an inum in the free pool is, by the pool's own
     definition, in no [ci] entry, so its in-core count is zero.  It rides
     ABOVE the disjunction because all three arms are uncached and agree on
     it -- and because that keeps the two movers' peel one line long.

     THE FREEZE TOKEN, per ARM and NOT above them.  [ifreeze] is one
     exclusive ledger cell ([ifreeze_excl] refutes ANY two fragments at one
     inum, equal phases included), so a bundle-level copy beside
     [pool_await]'s [ifreeze_post] would make the await arm unreachable --
     which is exactly the arm §1.3 needs.  So: the two ORDINARY arms carry
     the unfrozen token [ifreeze_off], the "right to freeze" that
     [IcacheInv.iref_upgrade_store_au] demands of a recycler and that
     [InodeRegion.ireg_freeze_au] swaps for [ifreeze_pre]; the AWAIT arm
     carries the freer's [ifreeze_post] inside [pool_await], where increment
     II already filed it.  One token per inum on every arm, never two. *)
  (* THE FREEZE MIRROR's UNCACHED HALF (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16) rides both
     rows beside the count half, and for its reason verbatim: the pool's
     domain is the complement of the live arms' inums, so one half per pool
     entry is one half per uncached inum.  The value is the literal [false]
     on all three arms: [FrzOff] on the two ordinary ones and [FrzPost] on
     the await arm, and [ireg_frzm_ok] is down at both.

     THE PENDING ARM's TOKEN IS IN ITS ESCROW (A⁗, §3.16): the off-lock
     deposit hands the retired [ifreeze_off] to
     [EscrowInode.escA_deposit_acc], which parks it in the escrow's FILLED
     state, and [escA_redeem] gives it to whoever converts this entry to an
     [imark].  Two copies of one exclusive ledger cell is not a choice --
     and the placement is what lets the AWAIT arm carry the STANDING freeze
     in the same escrow, which is the refuter §1.3 always wanted.

     THE ERA'S ABSTRACT VALUE IS NOT ON EITHER ROW (durable-disk C-3c).
     A freed inum's fragment travels from iput's payload to the region
     through the ESCROW's own EMPTY arm ([EscrowInode.escA_body]), which is
     the one place both the +0x94 park and the +0xba deposit reach -- so
     neither in-transition arm carries it and the deposit parks it
     region-side ([InodeRegion.ireg_top_park]) at the corpse's bare
     record. *)

  (* A LOADED entry's parked content: the in-memory record [dn] in the five
     metadata cells and the block map in the thirteen addrs cells, with the
     file's blocks and the indirect block alongside.  The inum is a
     parameter, not existential: the arm's inum-cell half pins it (§13.1b).

     PARKED-MEANS-FLUSHED: the loaded arm's region record IS the
     in-memory record ([dinode_at] at [dn], no separate [dn0]).  Every
     writer in this kernel ends with iupdate (writei's tail, itrunc's
     tail), so a holder can always re-establish it at iunlock -- and
     WITHOUT it, iget's eviction could never conclude the pool's
     allocated shape (whose [inode_ok] is about the ON-DISK record)
     from the loaded arm's (which is about the in-memory one).  The
     stale-record freedom exists only INSIDE a critical section: the
     checked-out bundle's dinode_at may lag until the holder's iupdate
     retags it.  Design: fs-icache.md §13 (parked-clean).

     THE DIRECTORY-WF CONJUNCT (§15(a)), the twin of the pool row's: a
     parked DIRECTORY's live records all name inums the inode region
     covers.  This is what namex destructs out of ilock's postcondition,
     and it is the reason dirlookup's [dir_inums_ok] premise is
     dischargeable at a directory nobody named in advance.

     ...AND ITS RESOURCE TWIN (§20.3, stage B), the twin of [ipool_alloc]'s:
     [dlinks] over this record's own [data].  It is what dirlookup will hand
     [iget] as licence (a)/(b) in stage C, borrowed out of this payload at
     the matched index and returned before the holder's iunlock.  Every
     re-park in the landed tree carries it unchanged because none of them
     changes a DIRECTORY's bytes.

     ...AND THE ".." INDEX CLAUSE, the twin of [ipool_alloc]'s: see there.
     create is its sole PRODUCER (at [dirlink(ip, "..", dp->inum)]); every
     other re-park in the tree transfers it, and the ones that move the
     record discharge it from [DirView]'s five ways -- most often
     [dir_dots_ix_orphan], since a walk that zeroes [nlink] before parking
     is parking a directory the clause says nothing about.

     ...AND ITS COMPLEMENT [DirView.dir_orphan_clean], the twin of
     [ipool_alloc]'s: see there.  Where [dir_dots_ix] is transferred by the
     peels and discharged by [_orphan] at the walks that zero a count, this
     one is exactly the other way round -- [_live] at every live directory,
     [_not_dir] at every file, [_size_zero] at a claim box and a truncated
     corpse -- and its one PRODUCING site is create's [fail:] twin, which
     parks a child it has just orphaned. *)

     the only two callers of [ilock] that hold no transaction -- can never
     park a transaction share, because it has none.  So its withdrawal is a
     SHARE: it takes a quarter of the byte legs and of the abstract fragment
     and leaves the rest here, and the collection reads the residue off the

  (* THE PAYLOAD THE VALID WORD KEYS, AT THE SLOT'S GENERATION, AND THE
     GENERATION'S TYPE ONE-SHOT ON ITS TWO POLARITIES (design §17.3 (A) /
     §17.6, ratified §17.4 / §17.7).

     [ic_loaded] DOES NOT MOVE -- it is named in nineteen files and this is
     why none of them changed; the generation rides HERE, where three files
     name it, and so does the witness: [ity_shot g (di_type dn)] on the
     LOADED polarity, [ity_pending g] on the UNLOADED one.

     WHY THE PENDING RIDES HERE AND NOT ONE LEVEL DOWN.  §17.3 (B) put it
     with [ipool_shape_np]'s ALLOCATED disjunct, on the argument that "ilock's
     fill MUST take the allocated branch -- it is where [dinode_at] lives".
     §16.4's CLAIM BOX refutes that: [ProofIlock]'s fill also completes on
     the MARKER branch, through [InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw], whenever ialloc
     has retagged the inum to a [fresh_shape] record.  Putting it on BOTH
     pool disjuncts is what §17.3 (B) refuted from the other side.  And it
     may NOT go into [ic_unloaded] either: [ic_mid_arm] holds [ic_unloaded]
     DIRECTLY and is sealed at iget's +0x72 ([ic_mk_unloaded],
     [ProofIget.v:1167]), six instructions before the slot enters [M] and any
     unit is split -- there is no pending in existence to put there.

     On this polarity the obligation lands exactly at iget's +0x7c
     ([ic_close_mid_to_parked]), where the recycler is already carrying the
     token by hand.  Both conjuncts are TIMELESS, so [ic_payload_timeless]
     survives verbatim (§17.1 (iv), respected).

     A GENERATION THEREFORE SEES AT MOST ONE FILL, which is the invariant
     §17.5 proved necessary: the recycle mints a generation and its pending
     ([IcacheInv.live_slot_alloc]); the fill spends it; and iput's free path
     -- the second filler, via §17.6.1's reachable claim-and-hit sequence --
     RETIRES the generation at +0x54 ([IcacheInv.live_slot_regen]) before it
     re-parks UNLOADED with a fresh pending.  The pool row, [imark],
     [InodeRegion] and [ProofIalloc] are untouched, which is §16's standing

  (* ==================================================================== *)

  (*  A-custody's words are "the freeze token RIDES THE PAYLOAD ... exactly
      like [dinode_at]", and this is where that lands.  [ic_payload] is the
      payload as an ARM holds it; [ic_payload_np] is the same bundle MINUS
      the token, which is what the eviction lemmas below and iput's free
      path speak at.  The split costs no arity anywhere and no other file
      names [ic_payload_np].

      WHY HERE AND NOT IN [ic_loaded].  [ic_loaded] is named in forty-five
      files and destructured in a dozen; [ic_payload] is named in eight.
      Both would put the token on the same custody path -- pool bundle ->
      parked arm -> holder -> parked arm -> pool -- because [ic_parked]'s
      payload conjunct is exactly this predicate.  The cheaper one wins, and
      the expensive one would also have poisoned the FREE path's eviction,
      whose payload is the FREEZER's (its token is standing at [FrzPost],
      not [FrzOff]); with the split, those lemmas keep their exact
      signatures by speaking at [_np].

      WHY [FrzOff] AND NOT [(ifreeze_off ∨ ifreeze_pre)].  A-custody's
      PARKED row offers the disjunction so that the freezer's +0x70 mid-free
      park has somewhere to put its [FrzPre].  That park is [ProofIput]'s and
      [EscrowDeposit]'s -- both red by design in this increment -- and every
      LANDED path through the arms is [FrzOff]-only: the recycle peels
      [FrzOff] out of the pool ([ipool_shape_to_np]), the fill carries it
      [ic_unloaded] -> [ic_loaded], the checkout hands it to the holder, the
      park takes it back and the eviction returns it to the pool's
      [ifreeze_off] arm.  Stating the disjunction now would cost every one of
      those a refutation it cannot yet perform (TRIPWIRE t2's obligation) and
      would buy nothing green.  The widening is the iput integration's, at
      the same one line.

      WHAT IT BUYS, which is the whole point of RULING A-prime: [SpecIlock]'s
      post now hands the holder [ifreeze_off z] beside the payload, so
      create's fresh child (ProofCreate) and sys_link's [ip->nlink++]
      (ProofSysLink) can pay [wp_iupdate_link]'s freeze-pin premise with the

  (* ---- THE PARKED ARM's TAIL, WIDENED BY A⁗ (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16) ----

     DEVIATION 1 (§3.10/§3.14) made the parked arm's TOKEN slot a
     disjunction so that iput's +0x70 mid-free park -- which runs INSIDE the
     freeze window -- had somewhere to put the phase the mint left standing.
     A⁗ widens the same disjunction from the token to the WHOLE tail, and
     that is what dissolves B2 and the ½-parking problem at once:

       LEFT  (the ordinary parked arm) -- the payload, the inum's unfrozen
             token, and the arm's own liveness half at the payload's
             generation.  Byte-for-byte what the arm has always held; the
             [live_gen] conjunct simply moved INSIDE, so that the frozen
             alternative can omit it.
       RIGHT (THE FROZEN PARK, iput +0x5e..+0x8a) -- the freeze RECEIPT and
             NOTHING ELSE.  The freer keeps the payload in its own hand from
             the +0x5e window exit to the +0xa8 deposit ([inode_raw], the
             block resources and, crucially, [dinode_at] with its identity
             intact -- which is exactly B2's "one bundle, two consumers"
             dissolved: there is no bundle to share), and the arm's liveness
             half is parked in [IcacheInv.frz_park], inside [islot2]'s live
             arm, where a foreign [idup] collides with it (OPEN(2.6b)).

     THE DISJUNCTION IS DECIDABLE AT EVERY READER, and by ONE line:
       * at iput+0x70 and +0x8a the freer holds [ifreeze_pre] (kept in hand
         since the mint) and the LEFT arm's [ifreeze_off] dies on
         [IcacheRef.ifreeze_excl];
       * at a CHECKOUT ([ic_swap_checkout]) the holder owes the refutation of
         the RIGHT arm, and RULING R-e pays it from the INVARIANT: the arm
         carries a QUARTER of the slot's freeze selector, [live_slot]'s
         frozen alternative holds the slot's whole liveness unit beside the
         other half, and the deposit the checkout hands straight back carries
         the caller's own positive slice -- [IcacheInv.frz_slot_kill] in one
         line, with no licence and no region open (recorded at ProofIlock).
     Every LEFT-only consumer ([ic_payload], [ic_mk_parked], [ic_swap_park],
     the eviction family) keeps its exact signature. *)
  (* ---- THE LOCK-WINDOW PIN, PER ARM (durable-disk B''-tx5) ----

     [ic_slot_cover]'s alternative (d) was inhabited by iput's three windows,
     and what it cost the commit was a slot at which the escrow holds no
     bundle and says nothing.  Two of the three -- [ic_held] (+0x3c..+0x5e,
     which spans [acquiresleep]) and [ic_payload_arm]'s frozen alternative
     (the +0x70 mid-free park) -- carry no descriptor at all, so a share of
     the freeing transaction's token parked in them would come back at an
     EXISTENTIAL [(t, q)] and could not be rejoined with the residue iput's
     caller must get back.  [IcacheRef.hpn_h] is the pin that fixes it: the
     arm holds one half BESIDE the share and the walk the other, and
     [hpn_agree] re-identifies the pair at the exit.

     THE PIN SITS INSIDE THE ARMS, NOT BESIDE THE DISJUNCTION.  A body-level
     [ic_pin_rest k ∨ ic_pin_tx k] is refutable at an empty [ln_tx]
     authority too, but it says nothing about WHICH arm is standing, so it
     does not refute [ic_held].  Per-arm, LAST conjunct each, it does:
     [ic_pin_rest] in [ic_out] / [ic_mid_arm] / [ic_empty_arm] /
     [ic_payload_arm]'s LEFT, [ic_pin_tx] in [ic_held] and in
     [ic_payload_arm]'s FROZEN alternative.  [DepFrz] needs no pin at all --
     the DESCRIPTOR is in iput's hand across that window, so its [(t, qt)]
     are two more fields of the constructor and the share rides in
     [ic_out_frz], exactly as [DepTx]'s does in [ic_dep_own]. *)

  (* THE LOADED POLARITY AT A NAMED RECORD (design §20.13/§20.14's (R1)).

     [ic_payload]'s [true] branch binds the record EXISTENTIALLY, which is
     right for the arms -- an arm says "this slot is loaded", not "it is
     loaded at THIS record" -- and wrong for a thread that carries the
     bundle across a window it is going to re-enter.  [ProofIput] is that
     thread: it reads [ip->nlink] at +0x40 off the record it is holding,
     hands the bundle back into the escrow across [acquiresleep], and takes
     it out again at +0x54.  Through an existential the record that comes
     back is a FRESH one and [nlink == 0] does not travel with it -- which
     is precisely the fact the region's (L3) needs at the free (fs-sysfile
     S5f's knot; the missing fact is [di_nlink dn2 = 0]).

     So the window opener below is stated at THIS predicate: the same [dn]
     and [bm] go in and come out.  It is exactly xv6's own REF-1 argument
     -- the sole reference holder's record cannot move under it -- made
     available to the proof, and it costs no arity anywhere: [ic_payload]
     is unchanged, and every arm still binds the record existentially.

     Carrying [⌜di_nlink dn = 0⌝] in the PAYLOAD instead is dead for

  (* ---- THE OUT ARM AND ITS SECOND ALTERNATIVE (IVd, §3.16's item 7) ----

     iput's window exit at +0x5e must deposit NO live mass -- the mint at
     +0x50 has already parked its reference's live slice and the escrow arm's
     half in [islot2]'s frozen park ([IcacheInv.frz_park]), where they must
     stay for the whole lock-free span, because that is where a foreign [idup]
     collides with them.  So the tail is a DISJUNCTION:

       LEFT  (every ordinary checkout) -- [ic_dep_res], the descriptor's own
             credential and the arm's liveness half, byte-for-byte what OUT
             has always held;
       RIGHT (THE FROZEN WINDOW, iput +0x5e..+0x70) -- the reference's COUNT
             FRAGMENT, its IDENTITY fraction, and the freeze RECEIPT: exactly
             [ic_dep_own] MINUS the two live slices, which are in the frozen
             park instead.

     THE COUNT FRAGMENT IS NOT DECORATION: it is exactly what keeps
     [ic_open_auth_ref]'s and [ic_open_held]'s REF-1 refutations of this arm
     alive ([iref_frag_two_lookup] -- two fragments at a count of one).  With
     the live slices parked, the LEFT arm's own live-mass refutation is not
     available and the count is all there is.

     THE IDENTITY FRACTION IS NOT DECORATION EITHER: the +0x70 park has to
     pin the arm's existentially-bound [dev]/[inum] to the cells it is putting
     back, and on the LEFT that pin is [ic_dep_own_ident]'s.  Here it is this
     conjunct, read with [ctx_word4_pointsto_agree] exactly as there.  It is a
     FRACTION, not the ½ discriminator halves: itrunc keeps those.

     AND IT IS STATED AT THE DESCRIPTOR, exactly as [ic_dep_own] is.  The
     window deposits [Xv6Cameras.DepFrz q dev inum], and that buys two things
     at once:

       * every ORDINARY consumer refutes this alternative in ONE LINE.  A
         parker ([ic_swap_park_arm]) and a borrower ([ic_open_out]) both name
         a descriptor WITH a generation, [ic_deposit_agree] / [ic_dep_park]
         pins the arm's to it, and [ic_dep_gname (DepFrz …) = None] closes it
         by [discriminate].  ([ic_dep_res] is [False] at [DepFrz], so the LEFT
         alternative collapses for them at the same stroke.)
       * THE FRACTIONS ARE NAMED.  The +0x70 park takes the count fragment and
         the identity slice back and needs them at exactly the [q] it put in
         -- the eviction rebuilds [iref_tok k q] beside a sleeplock share
         releasesleep returned at [q], and [iref_frag] does not split.  An
         existential fraction in the arm can be pinned by no resource; the
         descriptor pins it.

     WHY THE ARM AND NOT [ic_parked]: this span is the one in which the FREER
     still holds the identity cells (itrunc reads [ip->dev]/[ip->inum] and
     writes [ip->addrs]/[ip->size]), and OUT is the only arm that keeps no
     cells at all.  [ic_parked]'s frozen alternative -- see [ic_payload_arm]
     -- is the +0x70..+0x8a park, where the cells go back, and the freer moves
     from this arm to that one with [ic_swap_park_frz]. *)

  (* THE FOUR WF CLAUSES (§13.2, §13.9 on why the first one is an
     EQUALITY after all, §13.11 for the fourth): [ci] records exactly the
     LIVE slots, at ONE device.

     §13.7 weakened this to [dom M ⊆ dom ci] so that iput's last close could
     leave a ref-0 entry CACHED, and §13.9 undid that: xv6's scan hit-test
     requires [ref > 0] and its recycle takes the FIRST ref-0 slot without
     ever consulting a ref-0 slot's identity, so a cached ref-0 entry for
     inum B does not stop a later [iget(B)] recycling a DIFFERENT slot for B
     -- ci-injectivity is then false, and two escrow arms hold B's bundle
     against [InodeRegion.dinode_at_excl].  Under the equality a non-live
     slot holds no payload at all (its arm is [ic_empty_arm]) and the
     bundle went back to the pool at iput's last close, where the flush
     semantics that justify the eviction actually hold.  §13.8's empty arm is
     what makes the equality satisfiable at boot, which is what §13.7 thought
     it was fixing.

     [ci] is INJECTIVE on inums (xv6's own guarantee -- iget recycles only
     after a full scan misses, and the scan's LIVE-slot loop invariant is
     exactly what proves it, now that live is all [ci] records); and every
     cached inum is inside the inode region, which is what makes
     [mword_of_int] faithful on the pool's keys.

     AND THE TABLE IS SINGLE-DEVICE (§13.11).  The region and the pool are
     inum-keyed -- [InodeRegion]'s map is one file system's, [dinode_at γi
     inum dn] names an inum and nothing else -- so "this inum is not
     cached" has to be decidable from the inums alone.  But xv6's scan
     hit-test is on the PAIR (`ip->dev == dev && ip->inum == inum`, and the
     dev compare at iget+0x4c short-circuits BEFORE the inum is ever
     loaded), so a scan that misses proves only that no live slot carries
     (dev, inum) -- and a live slot at (dev', inum) would leave iget's
     recycle with no bundle to withdraw, a second [dinode_at] for one inum
     against [InodeRegion.dinode_at_excl], and [ci]-injectivity broken.
     The two coincide exactly when every cached entry has the SAME device,
     which is what this clause says and what [BioInv]'s [bv_dev V] already
     says for the buffer cache.  [dv] is the table's device; iget and idup
     instantiate it at their own [dev] argument, so the clause is
     re-established by construction at the one place [ci] grows. *)

  (*       durable-fs-plan.md section 4, the commit's collection)          *)
  (* ==================================================================== *)

  (* ---- WHY THE POOL CANNOT SIMPLY MOVE INTO AN INVARIANT --------------
     (durable-fs-plan.md section 4: the commit has to collect the UNCACHED
     inodes' bundles too, and it cannot take the itable spinlock.)

     [inv N P] hands its opener [|> P].  Both of this pool's consumers --
     iget's miss (ProofIget, the withdraw at the +0x72 store) and iput's
     evictions (ProofIput's two deposits) -- spend the bundle inside a
     store's ATOMIC UPDATE, where there is no step left to absorb a later
     (this file's own note at the head of section 0), and this tree has no
     later credits ([RiscvPtsto.num_laters_per_step _ := 0]).  So an
     invariant-resident pool would have to be TIMELESS, and the full
     the pool row is not: its pending and await alternatives hold
     [EscrowInode.escA_inv], an [inv].  [ipool_no_timeless_check] below is
     that obstruction, checked.

     SO THE POOL SPLITS BY ARM.  [ipool_ord] -- the ORDINARY alternative,
     which is the only one carrying an [FsStateEra.inode_owned_era] at all,
     i.e. the only one the commit's collection wants -- IS timeless, and it
     goes into an Iris invariant at [ipoolN] ([iInv .. as ">"] keeps working
     at both consumers).  [ipool_ext] -- pending and await, the two
     in-transition arms a FREER parks -- stays under the itable lock, and
     the lock keeps the invariant's index set as the RESIDENCY KEY, one
     conjunct in [ipool]'s own position.  So neither [itable_res2]'s arity
     nor iget's scan-loop hypothesis list moves, and no consumer outside
     this file's two movers ([ipool_take], [ipool_put]) changes shape.

     A consumer that lands on a pending/await inum refutes or redeems it
     exactly where it does today -- [ipool_shape_to_np], the caller's
     licence and [IcacheRef.ifreeze_excl] -- because both movers hand out
     and take back the FULL pool row. *)

  (* ---- THE THREE MOVERS ----------------------------------------------
     [ipool_take_lend] and [ipool_evict_lend] are ACCESSORS and not plain
     fupds, and that shape is the whole of C-3b: the pool's quarter has to
     be in the caller's hand at the same ghost step as the escrow arm's
     half, because the flip needs the whole cell and the partition moves
     with it.  They hand out a HALF -- the pool's quarter joined to the
     table's -- so [ic_open_empty_free] and the eviction family are called
     UNCHANGED, and the wand takes the flipped half back and
     returns the table its quarter.

     [ipool_put] needs no identity at all: it moves an inum out of the
     in-transition index into the ordinary one (or leaves it there, if the
     row is a pending/await arm), and the fifty identities do not move. *)

  (* THE RECYCLE, AND IT PEELS THE ROW ITSELF (durable-disk C-3b, C-7).
     iget's +0x72: the row goes out, the inum leaves [O] or leaves [X], the
     pool lends its quarter of the slot's identity so the flip below has a
     whole unit, and the wand records the new identity.

     SINCE C-7 IT ALSO DOES [ipool_shape_to_np]'s WORK, and the merge is
     FORCED rather than tidy.  An [X] inum's [InodeRegion.imark] is in the
     CORPSE LEDGER, whose row can only be deleted with the ledger ELEMENT --
     and the only place that element can be found is the escrow's FILLED arm,
     which the peel is what opens.  Since the ledger's domain IS [X], the
     peel and the index move have to be the same ghost step.  What comes out
     is therefore an ORDINARY row's four pieces, on both branches.

     THE AWAIT ARM IS A REFUTATION, NOT A CONVERSION (iclaim-ledger.md 1.3,
     and 3.1's reshaping of its premise): before the deposit the escrow holds
     the STANDING freeze, and the caller's LICENCE refutes it at the region
     ([IgetLic.iname_freeze_off] -- 2.6's table, at whichever of the five
     licences the caller presented).  The licence is borrowed and comes back.
     After the deposit the escrow hands back the ledger element and the
     re-armed [ifreeze_off], which is exactly the ordinary arm's token. *)

  (* ---- THE POOL-SIDE TWIN OF [ic_escrow_body_cover] (durable-disk C-4) --
     (durable-fs-plan.md section 4; the shape B''-tx5's REMAINS forced)

     THE COMMIT'S DOOR AT QUIESCENCE, and the ONE thing it adds to
     [ipool_inv_acc] is that NOTHING IS IN TRANSIT.  The escrow's per-slot
     cover ([ic_escrow_body_cover_all]) says what each of the fifty slots is
     holding; this says what the POOL is, and together they exhaust
     [region_inums nib] -- which is the whole point of C-3b's partition.

     [T = ∅] is read off the parked shares ([TxPin.tx_pins_no_ops] at the
     transit ledger, which IS a [tx_pins]): a walk
     between an eviction's identity flip and its deposit is inside iput,
     hence inside its caller's transaction, and at a commit the WAL's
     [ln_tx] authority is empty.  So the row comes out in B''-join's own
     three-part shape, and the residue the collection still has to place is
     [X] alone -- the pending/await rows, whose region slot carries C-3c's
     [InodeRegion.ireg_top_park] on [ireg_slot]'s PENDING arm and whose
     bundle the collection therefore reads REGION-side through
     [FsCollect.col_free_slot_acc], owing the pool nothing.

     The [ln_tx] authority is BORROWED and comes straight back: the
     committer holds it inside [LogInv.log_res] and needs it there. *)

     the pool does not hold as an ordinary row and that is not in transit is
     CACHED, and this is how the collection reaches the slot that caches it
     -- it names the slot, reads the escrow's own identity half off the open
     body, and PINS it to that inum against the pool's quarter.  What the
     collection does next is [ic_escrow_body_cover] at that slot, whose four
     alternatives are all stated at this very [dev]/[inum] pair. *)

  (* the obstruction the split is FOR, checked: the in-transition row is not
     Timeless, so a pool shape carrying it could never have moved into an
     invariant whole. *)

End IcacheEscrow.

(* THE ICACHE INSTANCE OF THE TRANSIT BOX (endgame §4.2, R3; formerly
   IcacheBox.v, merged here at R3.3 so the instance and the escrow it
   replaces live in one module).  STATUS: PROVEN (no [Admitted]).  The
   second instantiation of CtxBox.v (the "rule of two"); bcache's is
   BioInv v6.

   WHAT THIS FILE PINS, so R3 does not re-derive it in prose:

   M-1' THE DEAD SLOT IS AN IDENTITY, NOT A SHAPE.  id := option (dev × inum);
        None is "never identified or evicted".  P_hdr None x forces x = IcRaw
        (a fixed raw header: cells at any value, no payload ghost), so the
        recycler's (a) at c = 0 KNOWS the shape from the register's identity
        -- no refutation of Unloaded/Loaded is needed.  The vetted M-1
        discharge ("the pool owns sr_ident's inum after eviction") does not
        hold once the evicted inum has been re-cached in another slot k' --
        k' 's box owns the inum's pool resource then, and the recycler of k
        cannot see it.  Encoding deadness in the identity avoids the
        discharge entirely, and the L1 row's tie ⌜sr_ident r = ci !! k⌝
        mirrors the table's identification map exactly (ic_id retires).

   M-3  X := IcRaw | IcUnloaded g | IcLoaded g dn bm.  The generation rides
        the shape (the vetting's addition).  P_hdr = i_valid (full) ∗ the
        identity halves ∗ i_nlink ∗ the payload GHOST at (inum, x) -- the
        loaded/unloaded ghost with its frozen alternative, exactly today's
        ic_payload_arm minus its two cell conjuncts; P_rest = the other four
        meta cells + addrs at x.  Regrouping lemma: ic_payload_regroup.

   M-4  The holder's handle row: ic_deposit at DepShr redefined as
        l2_hold at the SHARE SINGLETON {[(Some (dev,inum), t) := s]} (keys and
        mass pinned, R-1) ∗ the share's identity cells ∗ its liveness slice.

   M-5  THE STAMPS MASS: a whole reference carries mass 1; a share of
        identity fraction s carries mass s; a parent that has lent identity
        (qt − qi) carries mass 1 − (qt − qi).  Σ mass over a slot's
        references = the count, as CtxBox's row (Σ) requires.  The doc's
        "mass q / s" (identity fractions) would break (Σ): a whole reference
        holds identity q ≤ 1/2 but must weigh 1.

   M-6  L2 payload := CtxBox.l2_row at tok := ic_tok; L1 row := ic_slot_row.

   Names (F19): the four box gnames per slot become a FIELD of ic_names
   (icn_box : nat → box_names; six MkIcNames sites, the smaller sweep, and
   what lets [ic_deposit cn k d] keep its name and arity).  In this
   skeleton the record [ic_boxes] stands in for that field so the file is
   self-contained; every [b] below is [cn] at R3.

   AFTER REVIEWER 1's RULE-0 AUDIT (F14–F20, applied here):
   F14  the recycle and the eviction CHANGE the shape at (b): CtxBox gains
        box_deposit_L1_shape (target x1, client entailment P_rest x0 ⊢
        P_rest x1); ic_rest_raw_unloaded / ic_rest_to_raw are the icache's
        two entailments.
   F15  the holder has the share MINUS slh_tok (acquiresleep deposited it):
        (e)/(f) take and return [ic_body k d], the descriptor's cells and
        slice; the client re-forms inode_shr2 after releasesleep.
   F16  (tso-flip) iput's own (e)/(f) at mass 1 with the WHOLE unit and a
        [DepRef] descriptor: NOT on this branch (endgame F39) -- iput's free
        path is main's guard (a) at count 1 plus the (g) exchange to
        [DepFrz]; [DepRef] is deleted from [ic_dep].
   F17  ic_slot_row carries the cnt half (tied to M !! k's count, 0 at
        None); the table's dead row keeps [islot_free_at] as the
        complement of the dead header's identity halves.
   F18  ic_decr over any identity (the eviction's (d) is at None).
   F20  boot deposits ic_rest k IcRaw. *)

  (*  THE FREE PATH's FROZEN PARK (iclaim-ledger.md §3.16, RULING A⁗)     *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* (d') THE MID-FREE PARK, and the re-open the +0x70 store needs.

     Between iput's window exit at +0x5e and its last close at +0x8a the
     escrow sits on [ic_parked]'s FROZEN alternative: the cells, the recycle
     token, the identification ghost and the freeze RECEIPT -- no payload, no
     liveness half, no deposit.  That is what lets the freer

       * carry [dinode_at], the block resources and [inode_raw] in its own
         hand across [itrunc], the [ip->type = 0] store and [releasesleep]
         (B2 dissolved), and
       * leave the arm's liveness half and its own reference slice parked in
         [islot2]'s FROZEN PARK for the whole lock-free span (OPEN(2.6b)
         closed),

     and it costs the escrow's five-arm shape nothing: the alternative lives
     inside [ic_payload_arm], where the token slot's disjunction already was.

     THE ARM IS DECIDED BY [ifreeze_pre] AT EVERY READER, which is why the
     freer keeps that fragment in hand from the mint at +0x50 to the close at
     +0x8a and parks the receipt instead. *)

  (* ...and its opener.  The freer identifies the arm by the identity slice it
     kept when the window exit split [i_inum] three ways (its own [q], the
     arm's ½ and the table's ½ − q), refutes OUT with the sleeplock's own
     token, MID/HELD/EMPTY with the cells, and [ic_parked]'s ORDINARY
     alternative with the [ifreeze_pre] in its hand. *)

  (* (e) THE RECYCLER'S RE-OPEN AT ITS VALID STORE (iget, +0x7c)
     (BioInv.escrow_open_mid).

     Its recycle token refutes BOTH normal arms, so the body is the window
     it parked; the reclose is at a normal parked arm, which re-absorbs the
     token.  The valid cell comes out for the physical [sw zero,64(s3)], and
     the inum cell comes out FULL so that the closer can split ½ back to the
     table and leave ½ in the arm. *)

  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

  (* WHY A SECOND SHAPE AT ALL.  [ic_tx_dep]'s invariant is "the arm holds
     [q] and the holder holds [q] beside it", which forces [q = 1/2] for the
     two to rejoin into the whole element [LogInv.log_tx] closes -- so TWO of
     them at one transaction claim 2 and the pair is UNSATISFIABLE, a premise
     nobody can discharge.  [create] (parent + fresh child) and [sys_unlink]
     ([dp] + [ip]) each hold two write locks at once, so each needs the arms
     at a QUARTER: two arms of 1/4 and a residue of 1/2 rejoin to 1 exactly
     as one arm of 1/2 and a residue of 1/2 do.

     THE ID IS NAMED HERE and closed existentially only at a boundary.  Two
     arms of one transaction must be at the SAME [t] -- shares at different
     ghost-map keys never rejoin into a whole element -- and nothing about
     the escrow determines an id, so a walk that holds two locks binds [t]
     in its stage statement and
     spells each conjunct at [ic_tx_dep_at]'s own arity.  That is what keeps
     the sweep POSITION-STABLE: a stage's bare [ic_deposit cn k d]
     becomes [ic_tx_dep_at cn k .. t (1/4)] in place, its [log_tx g] (or its
     whole [log_op g u], which becomes [log_opb g u]) loses the residue the

  (* [IcacheInv.islot] with the identity VALUES pinned by [ci] rather than
     ∃-bound: that is what makes "the cached inums" a function of the pure
     state, which is what the pool's domain is stated against.

     FOUR arms, not three (§13.7).  The (Some, Some) and (None, None) arms
     are §13.2's; the (None, Some) arm is the CACHED, REF-0 entry iput's last
     close leaves behind -- identity still written, payload still parked in
     the escrow, so its inum must stay OUT of the pool, which is exactly what
     keeping it in [ci] does.  It holds the table's whole share of both
     identity cells (the escrow keeps the other half of each forever,
     §13.1e), i.e. [islot_free_at] at [ci]'s values, and no [iref_slots]:
     there is no outstanding reference to account for.  Only (Some, None) is
     [False], and [dom M ⊆ dom ci] is what makes it unreachable -- which is
     what lets a slot accessor read [ci !! k] off a live [M !! k]. *)
  (* THE TABLE'S SHARE OF A NOT-LIVE SLOT (§13.8/§13.9).  Half the inum
     cell and NOTHING of the dev cell: the escrow's empty arm holds that one
     whole, and that is what a reference holder refutes it with.  Plus the
     table's [false] half of the identification ghost, which is what the
     RECYCLER arriving here reads -- it has no dev fraction to reason with,
     by construction. *)
  (* R3 (M-1'/F17): a DEAD slot's table half is the identity halves
     complementary to the dead header's ([islot_free_at]); the LIVE/EMPTY
     agreement [ic_id] retired -- the box register's identity IS [ci !! k]
     ([ic_slot_row] below, in the ξ-row). *)
  (* THE SIXTH FINAL SHAPE (r25 shapes; found by the day-one type-check
     gate, reviewer 2's rule 0): itable.lock's payload took the DEFINER's
     ambient context beside its own [ξ] -- through this row's cells and
     [islot2]'s -- so the handle at one context named a different payload
     from the handle at another and could not morph.  The rows now take the
     payload's [ξ] explicitly; at the acquirer's context they unfold to what
     they were, so consumers change one token. *)

  (* THE COUNT COUPLING's SLOT HALF (iclaim-ledger.md §2.2) rides on the LIVE
     arm, at this slot's own count: [icnt_half (bv_unsigned inum)
     (Pos.to_nat n)].  It is what every count-move lemma takes as an argument
     and hands back moved ([IcacheInv]'s five [*_store_au]s), and it is
     lock-held for the reason the rest of this record is -- iput has to hold
     it across an [acquiresleep] and no invariant survives that.  The REGION
     holds the other half ([InodeRegion.ireg_slot]), which is why a count move
     needs an [↑iregN] open (the probe's structural mask verdict).

     THE NOT-LIVE ARM DOES NOT GAIN ONE, and that is a recorded DEVIATION
     from §2.2 ("[islot_empty] gains it at 0").  It cannot: [islot_empty]'s
     [inum] is the value of the slot's own inum CELL, and at boot every one of
     the fifty cells reads ZERO ([IcacheBoot.itable_boot]'s zeroed BSS), so
     §2.2's ruling asks for fifty copies of [icnt_half 0 0] -- fraction 25 at
     one key, i.e. FALSE, and [IcacheBoot] would not close.  The uncached
     inums' halves have exactly one coherent home, the free POOL (whose domain
     [region_inums nib ∖ ci_inums ci] is precisely the complement of the live
     arms' inums, so pool ⊎ live = every region inum, one half each); wiring
     it is the recycle/eviction increment's, together with the boot premise
     that supplies them. *)

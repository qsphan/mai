(* SpecInstallTrans.v -- the public interface of install_trans, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     static void install_trans(int recovering) {
       for (int tail = 0; tail < log.lh.n; tail++) {
         struct buf *lbuf = bread(log.dev, log.start + tail + 1);
         struct buf *dbuf = bread(log.dev, log.lh.block[tail]);
         memmove(dbuf->data, lbuf->data, BSIZE);
         bwrite(dbuf);

         brelse(lbuf);
         brelse(dbuf);
       }
     }

   (gcc hoisted the [log.lh.n] test ahead of the prologue: at n <= 0 the
   function returns from a bare [c.ret] at +0xca having built no frame at
   all, and the printk of the recovering arm is inside the loop body.)

   THE COMMITTER-ONLY HELPER, WITH ITS FLAG AS A GHOST ARGUMENT.
   install_trans is [static]; end_op's commit calls it with recovering = 0
   and initlog's recover_from_log with recovering = 1, and both callers are
   holding the checked-out [log_state] -- the "log" spinlock is NOT held.
   The [recovering] bool is a ghost argument pinning a0 (the [either_copy]
   precedent).

   THE CONTRACT COVERS BOTH ARMS (durable-disk stage D2; the stage-2
   restriction [recovering = false \/ n = 0] is gone):
     - recovering = false, any n -- end_op's commit-time install: the
       memmove is content-preserving (the home block already holds the
       logged content, per the pure premise), L is frozen, the dirty
       entries flip at each bunpin, and one pin unit per entry comes back;
     - recovering = true, any n -- initlog's crash recovery: the home
       block holds its OLD content, so L MOVES entry by entry to the
       slots' logged contents ([it_rec_L]), nothing is pinned (the bunpin
       is skipped -- no dirty movement, no extra units), and the printk
       arm inside the loop body runs (proved against the real printk
       contract; [panic_env] already carries everything it needs).

   WHAT IT TAKES, AND WHY.  install_trans breads both blocks itself, so per
   write-set entry it wants no handle; it wants the log copy's CLIENT half
   and the log side's DIRTY half of the home block:

     [∗ list] i |-> w in W,
        fs_chalf (log_slot_bno logstart i)   (Lw i) *   (* its log copy    *)
        (uint w) |->[fs_dirty]{1/2} true

   plus the PURE tie for the home side:

     forall i w, W !! i = Some w -> L !! uint w = Some (Lw i)

   A COMMITTER-SIDE CONTRACT WITNESSES HOME CONTENT THROUGH THE AUTHORITY IT
   HOLDS, NOT THROUGH A CLIENT HALF -- a home block's [fs_chalf] is
   UNOBTAINABLE here.  The home blocks' client halves belong to the FS layer
   above by construction (log_write hands each one back to its caller, and
   [log_state] retains only the log REGION's), so end_op -- the only caller
   with a non-empty write set -- could never discharge such a premise.  What
   the committer does hold is [ghost_map_auth_frac (fs_cache γfs) 1 L], and one
   [ghost_map_lookup] against the payload the bread returns pins the home
   block's bytes to [L !! uint w], which the pure premise identifies with
   [Lw i].  The log slot's client half stays a resource: it rides in
   [log_state], so the caller has it for free.

   Both sides therefore land at content [Lw i], which is the write_log
   invariant made a precondition: after write_log ran, log slot i holds
   exactly the logged content of W[i], and the committer's authority has
   FROZEN both ever since.  It is what makes the memmove a
   content-preserving copy and therefore makes the destination handle
   [bio_locked] again (bytes = the payload's index), which is what bwrite
   and brelse demand.  Nothing is assumed about the DISK content of either
   -- bwrite moves the home block's disk cell, which is the whole point of
   the pass.

   [ghost_map_auth_frac (fs_cache γfs) 1 L] rides through UNCHANGED: install writes
   the DISK, not the logical view (the memmove writes bytes already equal to
   the logged content).  [ghost_map_auth_frac (fs_dirty γfs) 1 D] does move: each
   entry's flip true -> false at its bunpin needs the authority plus both
   halves (the payload's, out of the handle, and the log side's, peeled out
   of the batch's big-op by the caller), and the post's authority is
   [dirty_clear D (map uint W)].

   SLOT ACCOUNTING.  install_trans holds two buffers at a time, so it takes
   [bslots 2]; it returns [bslots (2 + length W)].  The surplus is
   real: each entry's [bunpin] frees the pin unit that log_write's [bpin]
   absorbed, and this is where it re-enters circulation.  Its home is the
   POOL parked in [log_state] ([bslots ((LOGBLOCKS - n) + 2)]) -- the
   caller (end_op, or initlog with an empty log) deposits the surplus there
   when it re-forms the batch at n = 0, and the arithmetic is exact because
   length W = n.  Nothing of that shows here: this contract is stated in
   terms of its own two in-flight buffers and says only what it produces.

   install_trans sleeps (bread, bwrite, brelse), so it threads the full
   running-process bundle exactly as SpecBread.v does, plus the disk fabric;
   it enters and returns at noff 0.  It has no panic site of its own, but
   its callees' arms want them. *)

     the log-region mirror half, which is what tells a fupd that the on-disk
     header still names the block it is about to overwrite).  A big-op of
     independent permits could therefore never be supplied: there is one
     such resource, not [n] of them.  So the premise is a REUSABLE GENERATOR
     over the one threaded resource [R], persistent and instantiated at each
     entry in turn; [R] itself is opaque here, which keeps install_trans as
     crash-agnostic as the rest of the log proofs.
     Each generated permit is the SEQUENTIAL one (sector-atomic-disk.md
     §6e): a home block lands one 512-byte sector at a time, and the chain
     threads [R] from one landing to the next.
     THE GENERATOR IS CURSOR-INDEXED (durable-disk flip-B): entry [i]
     consumes [R i] and returns [R (S i)], because a VALUE-chained client
     -- end_op's committer, which carries a picture of the whole durable
     disk -- moves to a different resource at every entry
     ([FsCrash.fs_install_v_seq_permit] at
     [R i := log_mirror_half (Mi i)], the chained [lm_upd]s).  The
     at-form's single [R] is the constant family.  The bytes are NOT
     quantified either: install_trans writes exactly the log copy's
     content [Lw i] (the memmove is a copy of the slot), so naming them
     is what lets the client's [Q] mention them.  Its [▷] is what the
     bwrite's own [▷ Q] postcondition hands back, and a client whose [R]
     is timeless -- the mirror half is -- strips it inside the fupd.) *)

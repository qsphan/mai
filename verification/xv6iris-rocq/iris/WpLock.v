(* WpLock.v -- the standard CSL/Iris spin-lock invariant for xv6's
   [struct spinlock], mirroring iris_heap_lang/lib/spin_lock.v but over the
   PHYSICAL fields of the Sail RISC-V machine: the 4-byte lock word
   ([lk->locked] @ +0) AND the 8-byte owner word ([lk->cpu] @ +16).

     lock_inv      -- ∃ v st, lock word ↦ v ∗ lk_cpu_res st lk ∗ ghost st
                        ∗ (st free ∗ v = 0 ∗ frag ∗ R  ∨  st held ∗ v ≠ 0)
     lk_cpu_res    -- the owner field, WHOLE at 0 while the lock is free or
                      in a one-store window, and HALF at [cpus_ptr i] plus
                      the held-lock-set fragment [lk_in i lk] while hart [i]
                      holds it (the other half is in that hart's
                      [LockSet.cpu_locks]).  See the block at its definition.
     is_lock       -- lock_name ∗ inv lockN lock_inv   (persistent)
     locked γ i    -- the lock-HOLDER token: hart [i] holds the lock and
                      [lk->cpu] holds [cpus_ptr i] = &cpus[i]

   BOTH physical fields belong to the invariant: no proof threads either of
   them, and there is no per-caller [lk->cpu] cell to pass around (the shape
   that made the cpu word look like private state -- unsound as soon as two
   harts race for the same lock).  What a holder carries instead is
   [locked γ i], and that token PINS [lk->cpu = cpus_ptr i]: the state ghost
   mirrors the field and the holder's fragment agrees with the invariant's
   authority.  So [holding()] provably returns 1 for the holder, which is all
   [release] needs.  A NON-holder learns nothing about the field -- so
   holding() may answer either way for it, and acquire's
   [if(holding(lk)) panic] arm is discharged by panic's contract rather than
   shown dead (SpecAcquire.v).

   [lock_state] mirrors both fields as one value, including the one-store
   window inside acquire (word already taken, [lk->cpu] not yet written):

     None            -- free:               word = 0, lk->cpu = 0
     Some (i, false) -- held by i, lk->cpu = 0 (acquire's window; release's
                        window between its cpu clear and its word clear)
     Some (i, true)  -- held by i, lk->cpu = cpus_ptr i                     *)

  (* >>> §0.34′ LANDS ON ITS SOUND AXIS (A6.119; §0.35′'s ξ-relativity, and
     A6.89's refutation SHARPENED rather than reversed).

     THE PRECISE BOUNDARY, because the earlier note read as a blanket warning
     and is not one:

       - A HART-INDEXED carrier is REFUTED.  The experiment was
         [locked `{CID : CpuId} γ i := lock_frag γ (Some (i,true)) ∗
         ⌜cpu_id = i⌝].  It dies at the first CONSUMER: every lock leaf hands
         the token THROUGH its instruction step, and the continuation's
         [locked γ i] is elaborated at the [CpuId] the [wp_next] lambda
         binds -- the RESUMING hart -- while the one in hand is at the entry
         hart.  The two print identically and do not unify (A6.63''/§0.20′'s
         re-park hazard, inside the token).

       - A ξ-INDEXED conjunct is LICENSED, and by the very fact that killed
         the other one: [CpuId] REBINDS at [wp_next]; [cur_ctx] DOES NOT.
         [SpecAcquire]'s own note says it -- "[cur_ctx] is bound OUTSIDE the
         [wp_next] binder, so the facts a thread wins are its own even if the
         prologue migrated".  So the token may carry ξ-indexed facts exactly
         where it may not carry hart-indexed ones.

     WHAT IT NOW CARRIES, and why: the ACQUIRE POSITION's floor.  The word's
     value-set pin (A6.119, §0.35′(iv) case 2) is minted at the AMO at that
     position, and [holding()]'s read needs [view_lb] at it -- a receipt only
     the acquirer ever had, at an instruction long past by the time the read
     runs.  The token is the one thing the holder holds across that gap.
     [lock_pos_agree] ties the token's [B] to the invariant's.

     ARITY UNCHANGED and ξ AMBIENT, so no consumer's spelling moves -- the
     same treatment [is_lock] took under §0.35′, and the 69 files that
     mention [locked] are the verification, not the cost. <<< *)

        [is_lock] is a CLOSED TERM; the ambient index falsified that
        outright, and no payload conversion could have repaired it.  The ∃
        closes the term again, and it is also the TRUE statement: the word
        belongs to whichever hart last stored it.
     2. RAW WAS CONSIDERED AND IS WRONG.  The lock word is only ever READ
        exclusively (acquire's [amoswap.w.aq] takes the machine's exclusive
        arm), so a raw cell would discharge every load -- but release's word
        clear is a STORE, and a store owes [Wobl_ram], whose γts update
        needs the cell's timestamp element.  A cell with no ledger residue
        cannot be stored to (A6.16).  So the residue stays.

     THE CLIENT-FACING SPELLINGS DO NOT MOVE: the creators still take, and
     the destroyers still hand back, [lk ↦₄ 0] at the caller's own context,
     and [lock_word_intro] is that bridge.

     >>> AND THE ELIMINATION DIRECTION IS NOT A LEMMA HERE.  Main states
     [lock_word_acc] as a [⊣⊢] and proves the ∃-elimination with
     [TsoCtxShim.ctx_word4_{to,of}_mem] -- sound at SC, where [ctx] is
     degenerate, and FALSE at this machine: a cell at an unknown ξ licenses
     no load at ours.  That direction is the M4 racy-owner-cell entry
     ([WpSconfLock]'s [wp_ld_lkcpu_lockopen_gen] is its twin one field
     over), and it is deliberately absent until the M4 memo lands. <<< *)
  (* >>> A6.84: THE ∃ IS GONE, AND WHAT REPLACED IT IS BETTER.  The ∃ξ
     closed [is_lock]'s term at the cost of an existential nothing could
     eliminate -- "a cell at an unknown ξ licenses no load at ours" -- so
     the two lock leaves that READ the word were unprovable.  At the
     LEDGER tier the cell has no ξ AT ALL: [phys_ledger_word4] is the
     eight-byte carrier's four-byte twin, ξ-free BY CONSTRUCTION, and the
     store gates over it are context-free ([ledger_store_win_at_ok]), so
     release's clear and the AMO's write need no [own_context] either.
     [is_lock] is a closed term for the reason §0.19′ wanted and with no
     residual existential.

     WHAT IT COSTS is the address's MAPPING, which a ledger cell does not
     carry: the invariant keeps the two [lk_addr_claim]s instead.  They
     are PERSISTENT and about the ADDRESS, not the value, so one peek
     serves every leaf ([WpSconfLock.lock_claims]).  <<< *)
  Definition lock_word (lk : mword 64) (v : mword 32) : iProp Σ :=
    TsoCtx.phys_ledger_word4 lk (DfracOwn 1) v.

  (* >>> A6.88: THE WORD'S HELD ARM CARRIES THE HOLDER'S OWN-WRITE RECEIPT,
     and it is [lk_cpu_cell_ex]'s shape one field over.  [holding()] reads
     BOTH lock fields and the holder's read of each must be EXACT; A6.78
     §(2) named the asymmetry for the owner CELL and A6.84 implemented it
     there, and the word wants it for the identical reason -- the invariant
     knows the CURRENT value, and under TSO a load may return an older one
     unless the reader can point at its own write.

     The state SELECTS the arm, exactly as [lk_cpu_cell_ex] does: a free
     lock's word is nobody's own write and carries no receipt; a held one
     is the holder's AMO and carries its message fragment. <<< *)
  (* >>> A6.119: THE WORD'S RACY KIT, AND IT IS THE PIN -- the fourth and, by
     measurement, final shape for this word.

     A6.92 refuted the AUTHORSHIP arm ([lock_word_ex] indexed by the holder):
     `amoswap` writes UNCONDITIONALLY, so a spinner that finds the lock held
     still stores, and after a failed acquire the word is the SPINNER's own
     write while the state still names the holder.  The plain word was then
     measured too weak at exactly one read -- [holding()]'s, which must
     conclude the word is nonzero and has nothing to conclude it from.  What
     is left is the VALUE-SET form, which is §0.35'(iv) case 2's own
     prescription: read the locked word against a value set on the racy kit.

     THE INSTRUMENT NOTE, since this word disambiguated the two racy kits:
     PIN for same-value-many-writers, TsWin for distinct-values-per-writer.
     [TsoCtx.ledger_read_pin_ok] concludes VALUE-SET MEMBERSHIP and its store
     gate's premise is "the stored value stays in the set" -- the spinner
     argument verbatim.  [ledger_read_racy_word_ok] concludes a NEGATIVE off
     per-agent-DISTINCT words: exactly the cpu cell's structure (each hart
     writes its own [cpus_ptr]) and exactly not this word's, where every
     agent writes the same 1 and the injectivity premise is unprovable.

     ARM-SHAPED BY THE STATE, [st = None] vs [st <> None]: the word is 1 from
     the WINNING amoswap until release's `sw x0`, spanning both
     [Some (i,false)] and [Some (i,true)] -- which is [lk_wex]'s domain used
     as the pure state function it was demoted to.  The free arm carries no
     pin: the free-path word read owns nothing and concludes nothing, and the
     only write to a free word is the winning AMO, which flips the state. <<< *)

  (* ===================================================================
     THE OWNER FIELD, AND THE HELD-SET FRAGMENT BESIDE IT.

     [lk->cpu] ([LockSet.lock_cpu], the 8-byte word at +16) is owned WHOLE by
     the invariant in every state.  What varies is what sits beside it: while
     hart [i] holds the lock, the invariant also keeps the held-set fragment
     [lk_in i r] at this lock's NAME (its rank orders it, but the set holds
     the name -- see LockRank.v's [locks_below]).  So
     the two readings of "this lock is held by hart i" -- the C field and the
     ghost set -- are one resource, and neither can drift from the other:

       - RELEASE's [lk->cpu = 0] retires the fragment, which is exactly the
         licence to take the name out of the hart's set
         ([LockSet.cpu_locks_delete]).
       - ACQUIRE's [lk->cpu = mycpu()] mints it, which needs [r ∉ S] -- and
         that is supplied by the caller's ORDER PREMISE
         ([LockRank.locks_below S r]), not read off the machine.
       - a hart whose set omits [r] therefore CANNOT be the holder, so
         [holding(lk)] is provably 0 and acquire's [if(holding(lk)) panic()]
         arm is DEAD rather than discharged by a panic credential.

     WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY THE SIMPLIFICATION IS THE ORDER'S DOING.
     Before the lock order existed, acquire had no premise to lean on, so
     [r ∉ S] had to be DERIVED: the hart co-owned HALF of every held lock's
     cpu cell (pinned at [cpus_ptr i]) and freshness fell out of the cell
     disagreeing at 0 in acquire's one-store window.  That forced a
     state-dependent sibling ([lk_cpu_half] / [lk_cpu_rest]), a fixed 1/2
     fraction the two READ leaves had to be blind to -- because
     [WpSconfMem.wp_load_s_sconf_au] fixes its [dqm] OUTSIDE the fupd that
     opens the invariant, where [st] is still existential -- and an EXCHANGE
     wand in each of the two cpu-word STORE leaves.  With the premise
     supplying freshness, all of it goes: the cell is [DfracOwn 1] in every
     state, the read leaves are state-blind for free, and the stores are
     ordinary stores. *)

  (* THE OWNER CELL'S CONTEXT IS ∃-QUANTIFIED, not ambient: [lk_cpu_res]
     sits inside [lock_inv] under the invariant, so an ambient index here
     would drag a context into [is_lock] -- the persistent HANDLE -- and a
     handle minted at boot could not be stated at another thread.  ∃ is
     also the true statement: the cell belongs to whichever hart last
     stored it.  The window lemmas below keep the ∃ ([lk_cpu_cell]); the
     SC-era trade for the acting hart's ambient form died with the shim,

     bytes are [TsoCtx.mem_free], and [mem_free] is the kmap claim over the
     visibility-free byte.  Both readings are here because the producer has
     both for free: every creator pays this claim off a CTX WORD it still
     holds, and a ctx word is ctx BYTES, each carrying its own mapping.

  (* THE PAYLOAD IS A FUNCTION OF THE CONTEXT (tso-port M3).  A lock's
     facts belong, at any moment, to a THREAD OF CONTROL: the depositor's

     acquirer's after its AMO.  A fixed [iProp] payload cannot say that --
     whichever context its facts were elaborated at, every OTHER thread's
     acquire would receive them at the wrong index.  So [R : CtxId →

     AT SC the parked payload is the ∃-closure below: the index is
     phantom under the seal, so "some context's facts" is as strong as

  (* >>> A6.105: THE FLOOR RIDES WITH THE CELL, and that is what keeps the

     to have passed that floor -- and no client ever names the floor itself.
     So they travel bundled, existentially, exactly as [lo] travels inside
     [is_lock]: every spec that said [lk_cpu_fresh lk] says [lk_cpu_ready lk]
     and keeps its arity, and [newlock] takes this in place of the cell plus
     a separate [ctx_floor] premise.

     belong in the arity. <<< *)
  (* >>> A6.105: THE FLOOR CERTIFICATE HAS TWO ARMS, and the second is the
     one a CREATOR can actually buy.

     Ruling §0.35'(i) puts [ctx_floor ξ lo] inside the handle so that every
     read can discharge its floor against [own_context].  That arm is free at
     [lo = 0] -- a boot lock's cell is an era-image cell -- but at a DYNAMIC
     lock it is unbuyable, and for the same reason A6.101 gave one level
     down: the creator's own [sd] is BUFFERED, so the store that made the
     floor never advances the storer's own view, and no fence or AMO stands
     between [initlock]'s store and the handle's construction.  Measured,
     not guessed: [ctx_bound_raise] wants [hart_view_lb lo] and the creator
     has no receipt at [lo].

     The right arm is what it DOES have: "[lo] is a real log position"
     ([TsoGhost.llb loglen_name lo], handed out by the store leaf beside the
     window).  Paired with an AMO's log-top view it yields the left arm on
     the spot -- [TsoCtxLedger.hart_view_lb_get] then [ctx_bound_raise] -- which is
     ruling §0.35'(iii)'s ABSORB, verbatim, at the first acquire.  So the
     floor is bought by the READER that needs it exact, not by the writer
     that cannot.

     The handle stays ξ-indexed (the left arm names [cur_ctx]), so §0.16''s
     crossing discipline is unchanged; what moves is WHERE the purchase
     happens. <<< *)
  (* >>> A6.120: THE RIGHT ARM IS THE OWN-WRITE WITNESS, not a bare log
     position.  §0.38′'s reading -- "you received this handle, or you wrote
     this lock" -- is now spelled with the ctx tower's own dirty witness
     ([TsoCtx.ctx_wrote]: the floor message is a dirty key of the creating
     context), which the read cashes against the running token on EITHER
     arm ([lk_floor_vis]).  A6.113 had measured that the bare [llb] cannot
     be cashed at a read at all (a view and a log position compare only at
     an AMO) -- which is what made the crossing upgrade look universal and
     left the creator's own first acquire (kinit's kfree, printfinit's
     printf) with no route.  The [llb] stays beside the witness: it is what

       D -- the DISPOSAL certificate.  Surrendering it destroys the invariant
            instead of closing it, and the opener keeps the contents.

     Two instances, and they are the whole point:

       inv lockN (lock_inv γ lk s R)              -- any T, D := False
            anyone may open, nobody may destroy: a static kernel lock, and
            exactly today's behaviour
       inv lockN (lock_inv γ lk s R ∨ D)          -- any T that REFUTES D
            the object may die: the invariant degenerates into a husk holding
            [D], and whoever can produce [D] puts it there and walks off with
            the memory.  [T] is whatever proves the object is not dead yet.

     A lock's storage is reclaimable exactly when the right to touch it is a
     resource rather than free knowledge -- which is the real xv6 rule for a
     kalloc'd object: you may take [pi->lock] only while you hold a reference
     to it, OR while you hold the lock.  Both are legitimate credentials, and
     BOTH are needed: the last holder to let go of a reference has already
     given it back by the time it calls release, and what licenses release's
     own three opens is the lock it is still holding.  That is why [T] is a
     parameter and not a fixed token -- see [lock_openable_holder].

     The mask is universally quantified so this file needs no [minstretN]; the
     leaves instantiate it at [⊤ ∖ ↑minstretN]. *)

     strictly more: [lkcpu_read_not_mine] wants the floor's visibility, and

  (* ---- THE FINISHING INTERFACE ---------------------------------------

     The other half: what the CALLER of release's word clear supplies to
     decide the invariant's fate.  At that instant the store has happened and
     the state ghost is back at [None], so the two zeroed words, the ghost
     state and [R] are all in hand at once -- which is why the choice has to
     be made HERE and not one instruction later.  The finisher is handed the
     close-or-destroy choice at mask [E] and the contents in PIECES, and
     produces the leaf's output resource [Out].

     Pieces, not a reassembled [lock_inv]: a destroying caller needs the ghost
     state (that is what it turns into a certificate) and a closing one can
     rebuild the body from them.  The two canonical instances are below. *)
  (* §0.35′(i) / A6.97 §(2): the floor is ∀-QUANTIFIED INSIDE the wand, not
     added to the arity -- the finisher is handed whichever [lo] the leaf's
     open produced, and no consumer of [lock_finisher] names it. *)
  (* THE FINISHER IS TWO-PART -- a PRELUDE and a BODY at the store -- because
     its two arms want the payload in two different shapes:
       close   : the invariant's free arm is the lock's stamped context with
                 the payload in it, so the payload must be MOVED there and
                 the context stamped ([lock_pay_intro]), which needs the
                 running token -- borrowable from [sie_cap] in straight-line
                 code (SieCapCtx) and NOT at the store, where the step engine
                 holds it inside its atomic update -- and the lock's parked
                 context, which the cpu clear hands back out of [locked];
       destroy : the caller's completion wand speaks at [cur_ctx]; the lock's
                 context dies with the lock.
     So the finisher CHOOSES the shape [Pay]: the prelude produces it with the
     token and the parked context in hand, the body consumes it at the store.
     [lock_finisher_body] is what the word-clear leaf takes; nothing outside

  (* [newlock] with the two halves SEPARATED: the ghost name is chosen first
     and the resource is supplied afterwards, so [R] may mention the name -- or,
     which is what forced this lemma, the whole LIST of names an ARRAY of locks
     is being built with.  [SchedCtx.proc_lock_res] is indexed by the [γs] of
     all NPROC proc locks (through [p_sched]), so allocating the 64 locks with
     [newlock] is circular and [SpecProcinit.procs_inv_alloc] runs this instead:
     one pass to pick the 64 names, then one pass to pay each lock its
     resource.  [newlock_d] is the same trick for a lock whose resource
     mentions its own cancel gname; the difference is that this one lands on a
     plain [is_lock] rather than the [∨ D] body. *)

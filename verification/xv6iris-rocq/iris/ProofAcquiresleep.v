      while (slk->locked) {

        release(&slk->lk);       /* +0x22 mv a0,s2  ; +0x24 jal  */
        sleep();                 /* +0x28 jal                    */

      }

   over the inner spinlock, then slk->locked:=1, slk->pid:=myproc()->pid,
   release(&slk->lk), epilogue.

   THE SLEEP PROTOCOL IS SPLIT (SpecSleep.v's header): the caller registers
   its channel under [sleep_prepare], drops the condition lock ITSELF, parks
   in the parameterless [sleep], and re-takes the lock ITSELF.  So the body of
   one iteration now contains four calls rather than one, and the trip through
   [release] .. [acquire] is the stretch where the resource index is [eb]
   rather than the literal [false]: the loop invariant carries [trap_csrs] and
   [cpu_claim pj] index-free, [arm_pay_ext_split] hands the pay half to the
   interior release and the [_ext] complement to sleep (which is exactly the
   pair sleep's contract asks for), and [arm_pay_ext_join] puts them back
   together after the re-acquire.

   The retry loop is UNBOUNDED (sleep may never see the lock free), so it is
   proved by iLöb over a loop lemma whose back edge (the c.bnez after the
   post-sleep reload) closes against the later-handing taken leaf
   [wp_cbnez_taken_s_sconf].  The two [lw]/branch sites (+0x18 beqz at entry,
   +0x32 bnez in-loop) both destruct [sl_res]: the FREE arm exits (beqz taken /
   bnez falls through), the HELD arm loops (beqz falls / bnez taken).

   sleep_prepare's "chan <> 0" premise is discharged INSIDE the loop, not
   demanded of acquiresleep's caller: the invariant owns the sleeplock's own
   word cell [slk ↦₄ _], and a [↦ₘ] byte carries [addr_is_ram] of its
   address, which is [0x80000000 <= slk] ([asl_word4_nonzero] below).

   THE HART-GENERIC PROTOCOL, IN THE [wp_next] FORM.  Every leaf and every
   callee hands its continuation back through [wp_next b p (fun CID => ...)],
   so the resumed hart arrives as an ordinary binder and every resource in the
   continuation is automatically about it -- no [(CID := h)] annotations and,
   since the SIE ghost went canonical per hart, no [g] to thread at all.  What
   is left to think about is WHERE the hart can actually move:

     * the entry index is DERIVABLY [true] ([CpuOwn.cpu_own_forces_on]: level 0
       with an enabled base has no [b = false] instance), so the prologue, the
       acquire crossing, the post-release epilogue and acquiresleep's own
       [wp_next] obligation are all hart-GENERIC;
     * from acquire's return to release's call the lock is HELD, i.e. the index
       is the literal [false], so every leaf in that stretch is a plain
       [rewrite wp_next_off] and the hart is pinned -- that is most of the
       function;
     * the genuine hart changes inside the wait loop are the interior
       release (whose exit index is [eb], because it pops back to level 0)
       and the park: [sleep]'s
       crossing index is the literal [true] because a [swtch] moves the hart
       with interrupts off.  Because the park is INSIDE the retry loop, it is
       the LOOP INVARIANT that has to survive a hart change.

   [asl_loop] / [asl_exit] are therefore themselves [wp_next]s, anchored at the
   whole function's entry hart [CID0] (the shape the porting guide recommends
   for a loop): forwarding one across an iteration is the identity, and only a
   USE costs a [wp_next_chain].  The three straight-line stretches stay their
   own lemmas -- [asl_exit_body] (+0x36..ret), [asl_post_sleep_body]
   (+0x32..the branch) and [asl_loop_body] (+0x1c..the sleep call) -- each with
   its OWN ambient [`{GEN : GenId} `{CID : CpuId} `{XI : CurCtx}] plus the anchor [CID0] and the one chained
   equality that links them.  The anchor is taken at type [CPU] rather than
   [CpuId] on purpose: it must NOT be an instance candidate, or it would
   compete with the lemma's ambient hart.

     * [asl_regs] is now hart-FREE: [HartTp.tp_pin] pins tp to the hart that
       owns the register file, so no map ever observes its tp slot and the
       old [cid_word_of h] conjunct (and with it the [callee_saved_notp]
       family) is gone.  A same-hart hop and a parking hop are the same
       [callee_saved] transport, [asl_regs_cs].
     * the trap CSRs ride the loop: acquire(&slk->lk) mints
       [arm_pay 0 eb _], sleep carries it across the park and hands it
       back, and the final release(&slk->lk) spends it.  acquiresleep is
       therefore trap-CSR-balanced and its own contract does not mention them.
     * the parked-scheduler record is NOT threaded here at all.  It lives in
       the running proc's own [p->lock] ([SchedCtx.run_slot]), which sleep
       reaches by holding that lock; acquiresleep never parks itself and so
       never names it.
     * The panic credentials are what acquire and sleep take; acquiresleep has no
       panic arm of its own after the park.

   THE HOLDER DEPOSIT, AND THE THREE PIECES THE FILE IS NOW IN.
   [SleepLock.sl_res_gen]'s HELD arm holds a resource the acquirer brought --
   [H q], the deposit -- because nothing weaker can ever be refuted from
   outside (SleepLock.v's header carries the frame argument).  So every
   stretch that can reach the [locked := 1] store threads [H q], the wait
   loop carries both it and the lock's own [sl_dep], and the exit stretch
   re-targets the free arm's junk fraction to the caller's [q]
   ([sl_free_retarget]) so that what stays in the lock is pinned to the token
   the call walks away with.

   That let the NESTED body be split so a contract can REFUTE its wait loop
   instead of proving it:

     * [asl_nested_core] -- everything but the wait loop, with the
       LOCKED arm handed off to whatever [asl_nloop] the caller supplies.
       Nothing in it reaches [sleep_prepare], so its held-set premise is down
       to FRESHNESS ("sleep lock" ∉ lks) -- no rank bound anywhere.
     * [wp_acquiresleep_nb_sconf] over it, which supplies a REFUTATION of
       the loop out of the caller's [slh_auth γt None].  There is no longer
       a BLOCKING nested contract to supply the loop itself: it reached
       [sleep] at noff >= 2, where sched panics, and iput -- its only
       consumer -- takes the non-blocking one now.  So the only acquiresleep
       that can sleep is the level-0 one, at [cpu_own 0].

   [asl_nexit] / [asl_nloop] carry a ROUTED resource [X], and it is not
   decoration: the entry test picks exactly one arm, and the non-blocking
   instance needs its counting authority on BOTH -- to refute the locked arm,
   and to hand back on the free one.  A static split is impossible, so the
   core takes [X] and routes it.

  (*  ROUTE B (3): THE NESTED acquiresleep, at [cpu_own (S n) eb pj C false]. *)
  (* ===================================================================== *)
  (* iput calls acquiresleep(&ip->lock) while HOLDING itable.lock (fs.c:348,
     the kernel's only nested acquiresleep).  The ordinary contract demands
     [cpu_own 0], because everything below it sleeps.  Design fs-icache.md
     13.12 rules that the sleeping branch DIVERGES instead -- sleep at
     noff >= 2 reaches sched's panic("sched locks") -- so the nested
     contract is the ordinary one restricted to the FREE branch, and it
     returns holding the sleeplock's resource exactly as the ordinary one
     delivers it.

     Three things fall out and none of them is a choice:
       - the resource index is the LITERAL [false] ([cpu_own]'s enabled arm
         demands noff = 0, which [S n] refutes), so there is no [b] binder,
         no [cpu_own_eb_agree] step and no [cpu_own_transport];
       - there is NO [eb = true] parking premise: the returning path never
         parks, and the branch that would has no postcondition to state;
       - the crossing index is [false] as well, so every leaf -- including
         the epilogue after release, which at level 0 exits at [outb = eb]
         and is therefore hart-generic there -- collapses through
         [wp_next_off_intro], and the whole function is ONE straight-line
         lemma.  In particular the [asl_loop] iLob invariant and its
         [asl_exit] anchor are NOT needed: the wait loop is entered only
         from the locked branch, which diverges before it can go round. *)

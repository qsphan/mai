   Design: claude-notes/design/fs-bitmap.md.

   ---- THE GEOMETRY, read off balloc/bfree ---------------------------

     BPB = BSIZE * 8 = 8192 bits per bitmap block
     BBLOCK(b, sb) = b / BPB + sb.bmapstart

   balloc's [sraiw a1,s5,0xd] / [lw a5,28(s6)] / [addw] pair is what pins
   BPB = 2^13 and puts [bmapstart] at [sb + 28]; bfree's [srliw a5,a1,0xd]
   / [lw a1,-1246(a1)] (= sb + 0x1c) says the same.  [sb.size] is at
   [sb + 4] ([lw a5,-1370(a5)] = sb + 0x4, and [lw a5,4(s6)] with
   [s6 = &sb]).

   FSSIZE = 2000 < BPB, so there is exactly ONE bitmap block and balloc's
   outer loop runs a single iteration.  That is why [size <= BPB] is a
   PREMISE of every contract here and the resource is keyed at the single
   block number [bmapstart] rather than at a family of them: a two-level
   induction for a case the mkfs image cannot reach would be structure
   nobody can exercise.

   ---- THE RESOURCE --------------------------------------------------

   [bitmap_res gfs bmapstart size used] IS [FsStateBitmap.free_bitmap_at],
   the design's free-space predicate (fs-state.md section 2), instantiated
   at the LOGGED view: [Gamma_L.fsPhi a v := a ↪[fs_bytes gfs] v], which is
   [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L].  It is two things and no more:

     - the bitmap block itself, at [BitmapEnc.bm_bytes] of the pure set
       [used] -- the block content is always in the IMAGE of an encoding
       over a pure index set, so setting a bit is [used ∪ {[bi]}] and the
       byte level is only ever read back;
     - THE FREE POOL: for every block below [size] whose bit is CLEAR,
       THE BLOCK ITSELF, at content nobody has committed to.

   THERE IS NO PURE CLAUSE.  [bitmap_ok] ("every clear bit below [size]
   names a covered home block, outside the log's own storage") used to be a
   conjunct of the resource -- a MAINTAINED statement about the whole used
   set, which is exactly what fs-state.md section 0 forbids.  It is still
   stated, and every reader still gets it, but it is now DERIVED at each
   read rather than carried: HOLDING A BLOCK'S BYTE RUN IS BEING A HOME
   BLOCK ([FsBlocks.fsblock_home]), and the pool holds the run of every
   clear bit, so [bitmap_pool_home] reads the whole of [bitmap_ok] off the
   pool's OWNERSHIP against [bytes_dom].  Nothing establishes it, nothing
   preserves it, and no boot client owes it -- fs-state.md section 0's "a
   consequence of the [∗]", not a clause.  [x <> 0] still comes free from
   [cov_ok] at the caller.

   ---- WHY THE HANDSHAKE IS SOUND -------------------------------------

   Exclusivity of the byte run, and nothing else.  There is no per-block
   ownership token any more (durable-disk 2b; [FsBlocks.blk_own] is gone):

     - balloc hands out the block's EXCLUSIVE run, so a caller that keeps
       one per block its own structures name concludes the new block is
       none of them ([FsBlocks.fsblock_excl]) -- the fact that
       re-establishes [InodeInv.blkmap_wf]'s injectivity;
     - bfree's [panic("freeing free block")] is DEAD, and
       [FsStateBitmap.free_pool_used] is the proof: the caller arrives
       holding the block's run, so if the bit were CLEAR the pool would
       hold a SECOND run at the same block, and two owners of one block's
       bytes is [False].  Refuting that panic is the main thing this
       invariant has to buy.

   ---- WHO OWNS [bitmap_res] BETWEEN CALLS ----------------------------

   Nobody outside this file: it is exclusive and there is one per file
   system, so threading it through contracts would serialize every
   allocator and freer in the kernel.  It lives in the Iris invariant
   [bitmap_inv], at an EXISTENTIAL set no contract names.                *)

  (*  THE INVARIANT: who owns [bitmap_res] between calls                *)
  (* ================================================================== *)

  (* [bitmap_res] is EXCLUSIVE and there is one per file system, so it
     cannot be threaded through contracts: a holder of it would serialize
     every allocator and every freer in the kernel -- and a process carrying
     it across user mode would serialize user mode itself.  It lives here,
     in an Iris invariant, at an EXISTENTIAL set: nobody outside this file
     ever names the current [used], and no contract above balloc/bfree says
     anything about it.

     The shape is [InodeRegion]'s, verbatim, one layer over: the block's
     byte run never leaves the invariant except at log_write's own ghost
     step.  A caller between bread and brelse holds the block's MACHINERY
     half in its handle, and that half against the parked run is what tells
     it the bytes it read are [bitmap_bytes used] for SOME [used] --
     [bitmap_read] below.  The one moment the run is withdrawn is
     [SpecLogWrite.wp_log_write_au]'s fupd, and the two suppliers of that
     fupd are [bitmap_alloc_au] (set a bit, take the block out of the pool)
     and [bitmap_free_au] (clear a bit, put the block back).  Both re-park
     the block at the written bytes in the same opening, so the invariant is
     never open across an instruction.

     WHY THE SUPPLIERS ARE STATED AT THE CALLER'S SET.  The caller learned
     [bsl = bitmap_bytes u0] at its bread; by the time its log_write fires,
     the invariant parks SOME [u1] with [bitmap_bytes u1 = bsl] -- the
     machinery half in the handle froze the BYTES, not the set.  The two
     need not be equal as sets (only below [BPB] do the bytes see them),
     and nothing downstream cares: [bitmap_bytes_eq_bit] transfers the one
     bit the caller tested, and [bitmap_bytes_ext] transfers the written
     image.  So each supplier takes the caller's [u0] and the caller's bit,
     and the [u1]-side bookkeeping stays inside this file. *)

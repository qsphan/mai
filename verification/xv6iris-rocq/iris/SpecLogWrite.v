(* SpecLogWrite.v -- the public interface of log_write, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

     void log_write(struct buf *b) {
       int i;
       acquire(&log.lock);
       if (log.lh.n >= LOGBLOCKS)      panic("too big a transaction");
       if (log.outstanding < 1)        panic("log_write outside of trans");
       for (i = 0; i < log.lh.n; i++)
         if (log.lh.block[i] == b->blockno) break;   // log absorption
       log.lh.block[i] = b->blockno;
       if (i == log.lh.n) { bpin(b); log.lh.n++; }
       release(&log.lock);
     }

   log_write does NOT sleep -- it takes only the "log" SPINLOCK and calls
   bpin (which takes the bcache spinlock) -- so it threads no running-process
   bundle: [cpu_own n eb p C b] at the caller's own nesting level, exactly
   like SpecBpin.v.  Both of its own panic arms
   are DEAD (see below), but acquire's own holding-check arm wants a panic
   contract regardless.

   THE CONTRACT (claude-notes/design/fs-log.md, "log_write(b)").  The caller
   arrives holding a buffer it has typically EDITED, so its handle is
   [bio_held] with the traveling bytes [bs] and the payload still indexed at
   the block's old logical content [bsl] -- not [bio_locked], which is
   precisely why it cannot brelse the buffer yet.  log_write moves the
   logged view L(bno) from [bsl] to [bs] (the log lock's authority plus the
   caller's [fs_chalf] half plus the handle's payload half), so the handle
   comes back RE-INDEXED and DIRTY: [bio_locked ... bs bsd true], which is
   what brelse will accept.

   [d] is the incoming payload polarity, and it decides which path runs:
     d = false -- the first log_write of this block in the current batch.
                  The block is appended to lh.block[], lh.n++, and [bpin]
                  mints the pin that keeps the buffer un-evictable until
                  install_trans installs it.
     d = true  -- log ABSORPTION: the block is already in lh.block[] (its
                  dirty payload carries the earlier bpin's reference), so no
                  bpin runs at all.
   NEITHER PATH COSTS THE CALLER A SLOT UNIT: [bslot] goes in and comes
   back out, unconditionally.  On the absorb path it is simply never spent;
   on the append path [bpin] absorbs it and the n++ releases one unit of the
   POOL parked in [log_state] ([bslots ((LOGBLOCKS - n) + 2)]) to replace
   it -- pool + n is invariant, and install_trans's bunpins refill it.  A
   conditional refund would poison every caller proof, which is exactly the
   argument the design doc's decision record makes about the budget unit.

   The BUDGET unit, by contrast, IS spent unconditionally on both paths
   ([log_op (S u)] in, [log_op u] out) -- always-consume is the C code's own
   worst-case MAXOPBLOCKS accounting (design doc, decision record).

   BOTH PANICS ARE DEAD, and the two ledger facts are what kill them:
     "too big a transaction"     -- a unit in hand forces lh.n < LOGBLOCKS
                                    (log_res's sum tie n + op_sum <= 30).
     "log_write outside of trans"-- an op token against the ledger authority
                                    forces log.outstanding >= 1
                                    (LogInv.log_op_positive). *)

(* THE ATOMIC-UPDATE FORM (claude-notes/design/fs-icache.md, §12): the
   caller's byte run arrives through a fupd fired at log_write's own ghost
   step instead of sitting in its hands for the whole call.

   WHY THIS EXISTS.  A dinode block's client half lives in the inode
   REGION's invariant (InodeRegion.v) and can never sit in a caller's
   hands across a call: iupdate's own log_write footprint holds every
   per-block exclusive resource, so a §11.4-style checkout window has
   nothing to deposit and is unstatable.  The only sound moment for the
   half to leave the region is the single ghost step where the logged
   view actually moves -- ProofLogWrite's [fsblock_update], a ghost
   moment between two instruction dispatches, at the AU's own mask.  This premise
   opens the caller's invariant exactly there:

   - the fupd surrenders the half at WHATEVER content the invariant
     parked ([bsl'], existential);
   - [fsblock_update]'s own agreement against the handle's payload half
     is what pins [bsl' = bsl] -- the caller never has to know the
     invariant's content in advance;
   - the closing fupd takes the half back at the WRITTEN bytes and pays
     out [Φfsb], the caller's chosen receipt (for iupdate: the retagged
     [dinode_at], via InodeRegion.ireg_write_au).

   A caller that HOLDS the run is the degenerate instance: [Efs := ⊤],
   [Φfsb := fsblock (fs_bytes γfs) (uint bno) bs], and the fupd is two iModIntros --
   that is [wp_log_write_gen] below, derived, so no existing caller
   moves. *)

     [LogInv.log_credit] admits the two ways of knowing that:
       - [uint bno ∈ Sb] -- this op appended it itself (the pure premise this
         used to be, now one disjunct; [LogInv.log_credit_own] is the
         one-step conversion every landed credited caller uses);
       - [logged_at γ e (uint bno)] with [e0 <= e] -- SOMEBODY appended it
         this batch, which is the case the kernel's absorption scan actually
         implements and the model used to under-claim (§G.1).
     The group form is what forces [e0] into the open: it must be ordered
     against the CALLER'S OWN birth epoch, so the ledger premise below is
     [log_opSe] (the epoch named) rather than [log_opS] (it buried).  A

     IT CARRIES ITS OWN ANCHOR, AND TAKES THE COMPARISON BACK (fs-log.md
     §G.17, blocker 4; fs-icache.md §20.18's C4).  The fupd surrenders a
     lower bound [log_epoch_lb γ v] BESIDE the half, and the closing wand
     is handed [logged_at γ e0 (uint bno)] and [⌜v <= e0⌝] as inputs.  Two
     things force that shape rather than the outer [vlb] premise's:

     - the anchor of the ONE writer that owes a receipt
       ([InodeRegion.ireg_write_unlink]) is the per-inum observation
       counter, which is INSIDE the invariant the fupd opens -- so its
       value is not nameable at the call site, only under this fupd;
     - the comparison [v <= e0] is unprovable anywhere but the ghost step,
       where the [ln_ep] auth is open (§G.14: two lower bounds on one
       counter are incomparable), and it is free THERE.

     A caller with no receipt to build takes [v := 0] and drops both wand
     inputs -- that is [lw_au_lb0] below, one line, so every landed AU
     supplier is unchanged.  The outer [log_epoch_lb γ vlb] premise and the
     [log_opSwe] post are untouched: they are the DEPOSITOR's tier (a
     receipt ordered against an anchor the caller can name), and this is
     the WRITER's. *)
  (* NOTHING OF THE FILE SYSTEM CROSSES THE AU (plan sections 3 and 8).  A
     [log_write] proves nothing about the file system: the client's closing
     wand hands back its own byte run and its own receipt, and the log's
     lock resource carries no client proposition to lend it. *)

(* THE EPOCH-EXPOSED GENERAL FORM (fs-log.md §G.20, the epoch tier).
   [wp_log_write_gen] with the birth epoch left OPEN on both sides: the
   ledger premise is [log_opSe] rather than [log_opS], the credit is the
   RESOURCE [log_credit] rather than the pure own-set claim, and the post
   hands the entry back AT THE SAME [e0].

   WHY BOTH SIDES.  A credit is a claim at a NAMED epoch -- its group
   disjunct is [∃ e, logged_at γ e b ∗ ⌜e0 <= e⌝] -- so a caller in the
   middle of a walk that means to spend one later must still be holding the
   entry at the [e0] its observation was ordered against.  [wp_log_write_gen]
   closes that existential on the way out, and once closed it cannot be
   recovered: a re-opened entry yields SOME [e1], and although [e1 = e0] is
   true (the ghost steps update the entry in place, and the epoch's only
   transition is the commit bump, which runs with no live entry), NOTHING in
   the logic relates two lower bounds on one counter (§G.14, §G.20).  So the
   epoch is threaded SYNTACTICALLY, from the observer down to the log_write
   that claims the credit, and this is the bottom of that thread.

   The witness comes out too, at the same epoch: it is free (the atomic-update
   form already mints it on both arms) and it is exactly what makes a SECOND
   write of this block by this op creditable.  A caller that wants neither
   applies [LogInv.log_opSe_opS] and is [wp_log_write_gen] again -- which is
   how that contract is derived, so no landed caller moves. *)

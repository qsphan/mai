(* SpecPrputc.v -- the public interface of Prputc, stated independently of its
   proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function proof
   file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     static void prputc(int c) { uartputc_sync(1, c); }

   NEW AT XV6_REV 163d39b, and it is the whole reason printk's cone changed.
   xv6 drives two 16550s: the console on UART0 and the diagnostic printer on
   UART1, and [prputc] is the one-line adapter that sends printk/printint/
   printptr's bytes to the SECOND port.  It replaces [consputc] as printk's
   character sink -- consputc is still the console's own path (console.c), and
   [SpecConsputc.v] is still its contract; nothing here supersedes that file.

   Twelve bytes of code: the standard 16-byte / 2-slot frame, [c.mv a1,a0]
   (the byte moves to uartputc_sync's second argument), [c.li a0,1] (the PORT
   INDEX -- [UartsFields.uart_index Uart1]) and one [jal].  It is exactly
   consputc's non-BACKSPACE arm with the port pinned to 1, so [ProofConsputc.v]
   is the shape to read.

   *** THE SECOND PORT'S WIRE IS DELIBERATELY UNCONSTRAINED. ***
   THE OWNER'S RULING (claude-notes/projects/xv6-bump-163d39b.md, "THE OWNER'S
   RULING: UART1's output is unconstrained"): nothing in the system tracks what
   printk or panic put on that wire, so this contract owes NO [uart_sent], no
   ledger, no trace obligation -- only that its store goes through.  Three
   consequences, and they are what make this file short:

     - NO TRACE PARAMETER and NO TRACE POSTCONDITION.  consputc's contract
       asks its caller for a JUSTIFICATION CHAIN over the bytes it pushes, and
       [SpecConsputc.v] even names WHICH bytes, because the console's echo has
       to be matched to the byte it echoes.  There is no such obligation at the
       second port: [WpUart.chist_at Uart1] is [emp], so the chain
       uartputc_sync still asks for is built inside the proof out of the
       payload itself ([WpUart.out_chain_triv]) and the payload it returns is
       dropped.

     - NO [dev_inv].  [WpUart.dev_inv] is the CONSOLE BUNDLE -- it names
       [uart_inv Uart0], the PLIC and the disk -- so it cannot even be STATED
       about this port, and widening it would put a resource nobody uses into
       the ~140 specs that name it.  What this cone needs is the second port's
       own ordinary invariant, [uart_inv Uart1].

     - THE GHOST NAMES ARE EXISTENTIAL ([prputc_env] below).  They occur
       nowhere else in the contract -- there being no postcondition about the
       port -- so binding them costs nothing and keeps every caller above
       (printint, printk, panic, and the ninety specs that thread
       [SpecPanic.panic_env]) free of a UART1 parameter.  Same argument, and
       the same physical pinning, as [SpecPanic.v]'s note on its own
       existentials. *)

  (* THE SECOND PORT, AS ONE PERSISTENT CREDENTIAL.  Three conjuncts, all of
     them the ordinary port-indexed forms, and all of them hart-free:

       [uart_inv Uart1 γ1]        -- the port's own device invariant.  NOT
                                     [dev_inv], which is the console bundle
                                     (see the header).
       [is_txlock_at Uart1 γl1 γ1] -- `&uarts[1].tx_lock` under the name
                                     `uartinit` gave it ([UartTxInv]), and it
                                     carries the frozen [uart_dlab_off γ1]
                                     the THR store needs.
       [uart_base_word Uart1]     -- what `uarts[1].base` HOLDS.  The MMIO
                                     address is a LOADED value now
                                     ([UartsFields.v]), so a store proof needs
                                     the .data word's persistent snapshot.

     NOTHING ABOUT THE BYTES.  That is the owner's ruling, and this is the
     credential where its absence shows: a holder of [prputc_env] can print,
     and can say nothing whatever about what came out.

     The names are EXISTENTIAL because they occur nowhere else in any contract
     above this one; see the header. *)

(* SpecIunlock.v -- the public interface of iunlock, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void iunlock(struct inode *ip) {
       if (ip == 0 || !holdingsleep(&ip->lock) || ip->ref < 1)
         panic("iunlock");
       releasesleep(&ip->lock);
     }

   64 bytes, 25 instructions: guard, then release.  ilock's inverse, and the
   PARK half of the icache seam.

   ---- WHAT IT CONSUMES AND WHAT IT GIVES BACK -------------------------

   It consumes exactly what SpecIlock v3 produced -- the checked-out bundle,
   at whatever [(dn', bm')] the holder ended with (a writei between the two
   moves them) -- and it PARKS it, handing the entry sleeplock's variable
   back whole inside releasesleep.  What comes out is the caller's SHARE,
   entire: §13.1d's deposit run backwards, over §14.6's share layer.

   NOTHING IS EXISTENTIAL ANY MORE (v3, design §14.8).  v2 returned
   [∃ q, inode_ref …] -- [ic_swap_park] pinned the arm's [dev] and [inum] off
   the identity halves the holder handed back (§13.1e) but could say nothing
   about the fraction, exactly as [BioInv]'s brelse cannot.  Under the
   checkout DESCRIPTOR the holder carries [IcacheEscrow.ic_deposit fsc_ic k d]
   across its critical section, and one
   [ghost_var_agree] at the park pins the kind, the fraction AND the identity
   at once.  That half is a PREMISE here, and it is not bookkeeping: it is
   what tells this parker's arm from iput's window-exit parker's, which holds
   an otherwise identical bundle (§14.8's two-parkers problem).

   PARKED-MEANS-FLUSHED is the one obligation this contract adds over v1's:
   [ic_loaded] carries [InodeRegion.dinode_at γi inum dn'] at the SAME [dn']
   as the metadata cells, i.e. "park only with the region record retagged to
   the record you are parking" (§13.1d).  Every writer in this kernel ends
   with iupdate -- writei's tail, itrunc's tail -- so a holder can always
   re-establish it, and WITHOUT it iget's eviction could never conclude the
   pool's allocated shape (whose [inode_ok] is about the ON-DISK record)
   from the parked arm's (about the in-memory one).  A reader that never
   writes, like fileread, gets it straight out of ilock (§13.6).

   THE THREE PANIC TESTS ARE ALL DEAD.  [ip == 0] because the entry is slot
   [k] and [IcacheRefDefs.ientry_unsigned] says its address is
   [itable + 24 + 136k]; [ip->ref < 1] by [IcacheInv.iref_live_load_au]
   against [itable_inv], over a LIVENESS SLICE borrowed from the escrow's
   checked-out arm for the duration of that one atomic update ([ic_open_out]
   -- the holder's FULL valid cell is what refutes the other two arms,
   §13.1d), since after ilock's deposit the holder owns nothing of its own.
   v2 borrowed the arm's whole reference; under the descriptor the arm may
   hold only a share, which has no count fragment at all -- but both shapes
   carry a liveness slice, and a slice is all the guard ever needed
   (§14.6);
   [!holdingsleep(&ip->lock)] because the holder's bundle -- the token, the
   lock's pid field and the caller's own pid cell agreeing -- is exactly what
   makes holdingsleep return 1 (SpecHoldingsleep.v is stated in that
   HOLDER's form for this reason).

   iunlock does NOT sleep, so it threads no parking bundle -- but
   releasesleep WAKES every process sleeping on the lock, so wakeup's
   resources ([procs_inv]) are threaded through, exactly as SpecBrelse.v
   does for the same call. *)

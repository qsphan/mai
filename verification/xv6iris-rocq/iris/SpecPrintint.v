(* SpecPrintint.v -- the public interface of Printint, stated independently of
   its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     static void printint(long long xx, int base, int sign) {
       char buf[20]; int i; unsigned long long x;
       if (sign && (sign = (xx < 0))) x = -xx; else x = xx;
       i = 0;
       do { buf[i++] = digits[x % base]; } while ((x /= base) != 0);
       if (sign) buf[i++] = '-';
       while (--i >= 0) prputc(buf[i]);
     }

   THE POST SAYS NOTHING AT ALL ABOUT THE OUTPUT, and at XV6_REV 163d39b that
   is not a weakening for convenience but the ruling.  printint's character
   sink is [prputc] now, not [consputc]: the digits go to the SECOND 16550,
   whose wire nothing in the system tracks (claude-notes/projects/
   xv6-bump-163d39b.md, "THE OWNER'S RULING: UART1's output is
   unconstrained"), so there is no trace to extend and no [bs] to thread.
   What used to be here -- a sublist trace claim in, its extension out
   -- was already existential in [cs] for a separate reason (a digit-accurate
   post would have to name the base-[base] representation of [xx] and thread
   it up through printk's format recursion, for no consumer); the ruling
   removes even the existential.

   THE ONE PRECONDITION THAT IS NOT BOILERPLATE is the range of [base]:

       10 <= uint base <= 16

   and both ends are load-bearing, not defensive:

   - the UPPER bound is what makes [digits[x % base]] a legal read.  [digits] is
     a 16-byte table, and the code indexes it by [x % base] with no check; a
     [base] above 16 would index off the end.
   - the LOWER bound is what makes [buf] big enough.  The do-while writes one
     byte per base-[base] digit of [x] and [buf] holds 20; a 64-bit [x] has at
     most 20 digits once [base >= 10], and in the negative case at most 19 plus
     the '-'.  With [base = 2] the same code would write 64 bytes and run off
     the frame, so this is a genuine caller obligation, and printk (which calls
     only with 10 and 16) discharges it.

   [kernel_data] supplies the [digits] table itself.

   THE PANIC PATH IS GONE, and with it everything this contract used to carry
   because of it: printk.c's [panicking]/[panicked] globals are deleted, so
   there are no flag cells and no [eq_vec]/[neq_vec] refutation premises.  What
   arrives in their place is what every printed byte costs -- a [tx_lock]
   acquire/release round trip per byte, at the SECOND port's lock -- so
   printint threads the ordinary spinlock-caller accounting ([cpu_own]
   net-zero, the [noff] transient bound) and brings ONE persistent credential,
   [SpecPrputc.prputc_env]: the second port's invariant, its transmit lock and
   the .data word its MMIO base is loaded from, with the ghost names
   existentially bound.  The transmitter token itself is never threaded -- it
   lives under that lock. *)

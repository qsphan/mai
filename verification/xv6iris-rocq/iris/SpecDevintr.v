   -- never a whole-function proof file.

     int devintr(void) {
       uint64 scause = r_scause();
       if (scause == 0x8000000000000009L) {          // supervisor external, via PLIC
         int irq = plic_claim();

       } else return 0;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.devintr, 134 bytes, 52 instructions, a 32-byte frame
   (ra/s0 always, s1 SHRINK-WRAPPED into the PLIC arm).

   THIS IS THE MACHINE'S INTERRUPT DEMULTIPLEXER, and the contract is
   correspondingly the point at which the whole device complement becomes ONE
   object.  Every credential devintr needs is PERSISTENT, so they are bundled
   as [devintr_caps] rather than listed: a caller threads one hypothesis, and
   adding a device to the machine changes the bundle rather than every
   contract on the trap path.

   THE RETURN VALUE IS A FUNCTION OF scause, and the spec says so
   ([devintr_ret]).  That is why the [scause] cell is threaded EXPLICITLY and
   at a PINNED value rather than taken from [IntrDefs.trap_csrs], whose scause
   is existential: a caller receiving only "the result is 0, 1 or 2" could not
   tell which, and the three-way branch is the entire content of the function.
   The cell comes back untouched (nothing devintr calls owns it, and with
   interrupts off no trap rewrites it).  [dq] is any fraction: the read pins
   the value and does not need the cell exclusively.

   THE printk ARM IS STILL DEAD, and the second UART did not weaken the
   argument -- [PlicPlan.plic_claim_ret_ok] stays CLOSED, it merely gained an
   arm: a claim returns 0, [uart_irq_id Uart0], [uart_irq_id Uart1] or
   [virtio_irq_id].  So there are now THREE [beq]s above it, they are
   exhaustive on the nonzero cases, and the [c.bnez a4] at +0x48 provably
   falls through.  Nothing on this path calls printk -- which matters, because
   only printk's PANIC path is proved.

   INTERRUPTS ARE OFF ([b = false]), and not as a convenience: plic_claim,
   plic_complete and clockintr are each [false]-ONLY (they call cpuid()
   unbracketed, and cpuid reads tp mid-body), and clockintr's [tick_keeper] is
   hart-indexed.  xv6 agrees -- devintr runs only from usertrap()/kerneltrap(),
   the latter of which PANICS if it finds interrupts enabled.  So the contract
   carries no [wp_next] wrapper ([wp_next_off] would collapse it anyway).

   WHAT THE CONTRACT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY: anything about what the
   handlers did.  A completion reaches the process that was waiting for it
   through [disk_res] / [tx_res] / the proc array, never through devintr's
   postcondition -- so the post is just "callee-saved registers preserved, a0
   = [devintr_ret scause], everything handed back". *)

  (* THE SECOND PORT, AS ONE ROW WITH ITS GHOST NAME BURIED.              *)
  (* ------------------------------------------------------------------ *)
  (* [irq == UART1_IRQ] calls the SAME uartintr at [Uart1], and that
     contract is stated port-generically, so devintr owes four things it
     did not owe before:

       [uart_inv Uart1 γ1]   the second port's own invariant.  The console
                             bundle [dev_inv] deliberately does not contain
                             it (WpUart.v: "the bundle is the console
                             port's");
       [plic_inv γu γ1]      the PLIC at a NAMED second bundle.  [dev_inv]
                             does carry the PLIC, but at an EXISTENTIAL
                             second name -- which is all a client that only
                             claims and completes needs, and is what keeps
                             the console bundle at arity 2.  devintr needs
                             more: it CONSUMES source 12's payload at a
                             named [γ1] and hands it to uartintr;
       [uart_inited γ1]      the second port's one-shot, PAST its deposit.
                             Port 1 has a real pre-state -- uartinitone
                             threads [uart_rx_tok γ1] through its FCR flush
                             and deposits it (SpecUartinit.v) -- so
                             [plic_slots_claim] has to refute that arm at
                             source 12 exactly as it does at source 10
                             before it can hand the payload out.  Hence a
                             witness per port, not one;
       [uart_dlab_off γ1]    DLAB IS OFF AT THE SECOND PORT.  uartintr's RHR
                             pop reads offset 0, which is the divisor latch
                             while DLAB is set, and it pops at BOTH ports.
                             At the console the fact rides inside
                             [SpecConsoleintr.console_caps]'s [is_txlock];
                             port 1 has no such bundle here, so it is a row
                             of its own.  [uartinit] freezes it at both
                             ports and hands both out ([SpecUartinit.v]).

     WHAT LEFT THIS BUNDLE, and where it went.  It used to carry
     [UartsFields.uarts_pinned] -- the two immutable `uarts[]` fields at the
     RAW PHYSICAL tier -- because uartintr took that form.  It does not any
     more: an S-mode load leaf consumes the CONTEXT tier and no law crosses
     the two ([SpecUartintr.v]), so the credential a driver must be handed
     is the VA-tier [SpecUartPutc.uarts_words].  That row is
     CONTEXT-RELATIVE, and this bundle may not hold one: it is rebuilt at a
     foreign context by [UsertrapRes.ut_caps_of_park], which holds no
     domination and can transport nothing.  So all four words -- BOTH ports'
     -- ride [SpecConsoleintr.console_caps], which the resumer's
     [park_globals] supplies at its own context, and this bundle stays
     entirely ξ-free.  The [Uart1] arm of [ProofDevintr] projects port 1's
     pair out of the console bundle it is holding anyway.

     THE NAME IS EXISTENTIAL HERE FOR THE SAME REASON IT IS IN [dev_inv].
     devintr's postcondition says nothing whatever about the second port --
     the owner's ruling is that UART1's output is unconstrained -- so no
     caller ever has to agree with devintr about WHICH bundle it is; the
     function only needs the invariant and the payload to be at the same
     one.  Burying it is what keeps this an ADDITIVE row: [devintr_caps],
     [UsertrapRes.devintr_caps_any], [SpecKerneltrap], [SpecKernelvec] and
     [SpecUserinit] all keep their arity, and the five construction sites
     gain one row instead of a parameter each.  A reader of the [Uart1] arm
     still sees exactly which resource paid for it, which is the test that
     distinguishes bundling from burying. *)

  (* Everything the five handlers ask of a caller, in the order the branches
     reach them:

       [dev_inv]      the memory-mapped device invariant (UART + PLIC +
                      virtio-mmio), which plic_claim/plic_complete open around
                      their MMIO transactions and which the UART leaves need.
                      IT IS ALSO ALL uartintr ITSELF WANTS: ae96fd0's handler
                      takes no lock and moves no device ghost;
       [console_caps]  what uartintr PASSES ON.  consoleintr is proven now, and
                      its proof cannot be silent about the echo: it takes
                      cons.lock and, through consputc, tx_lock.  So the two
                      lock credentials come back into this bundle -- bundled,
                      with both ghost names existential, so this is one
                      conjunct and no parameter (SpecConsoleintr.v).  NOTHING

                      hart 0 does (a disjunction the other harts discharge for
                      free);

(* A6.139: THE BUNDLE CROSSES CONTEXTS -- every ξ-relative member is a lock
   handle ([CtxMorph] via [SchedCtx.is_lock_morph]) and the rest are
   context-free.  This is what funds [SpecKernelvec.kernelvec_env]'s packed
   crossing witness.  Stated after the section so the bundle's context is
   explicit (SchedCtx's A6.129 pattern): the transport class names no hart,
   while the bundle's hart is a PARAMETER of the payload -- a parked world's
   credentials stay at the parked hart while the mover runs wherever it
   runs.  [disk_geom] is carried by [DiskInv.disk_geom_morph]; the console
   bundle's own name is qualified because [SpecMainSecondary] states the

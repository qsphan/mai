(* WpSconfMem.v -- the SIE-AGNOSTIC data-leaf layer (interrupt-sweep
   stage 5): the [sconf]+[sie_cap] twins of the width-8 RVC LOAD/STORE
   exemplars (WpSmodePtLeaves.v's [wp_cld_s_pt]/[wp_csd_s_pt]), over the
   agnostic funnel [wp_instr_s_sconf].

   The data-side translation runs through the regime-blind absorption
   [sr_absorb strans_regime] INSIDE the funnel's σf-callback: the
   callback threads the FOLDED translation slot [strans_inv] (as "Htr")
   through [strans_regime] with NO skolem-root open, effective-address
   transform comes from [sr_transform strans_regime], and the post-
   translate PMP/PMA facts come from [sr_absorb]'s [pmp_grant_facts]
   conclusion (mirroring the R-generic `_r` data leaves).  The config
   facts (MPRV/SXL/MXR/PMM) come from [sconf]'s bundled fact sets
   instead of eight per-call premises.  Spec cleanups made in this pass:
     - the redundant [let ea := .. let a8 := ea let pa := a8] alias
       chain collapses to a single binder -- named [ea], because it is
       the EFFECTIVE (pre-translation, VIRTUAL) address: the physical one
       is [pa_of ppn ea], formed separately inside the proof.  (Every leaf
       in this file that ABSORBS a translation now spells it [ea]; the
       thin wrappers below, and WpSconfLock.v's leaves, still say [pa] --
       same misnomer, renamed as they are next touched.  The binder is a
       [let] inside the statement, so the rename is invisible to callers.)
     - ALL config premises are gone (SIE is decided by the ghost, the
       rest ride in [sconf_ms_facts]/the menvcfg conjunct);
     - the STORE needs no rd-premises at all (it writes no register,
       so [sie_cap] is not even retargeted); the LOAD keeps
       [uint rd <> 0] and [rd_ok rd] (the latter replaces the old
       [rd <> csp_rs1] IN THE SAME SLOT: it also rules out tp, which the
       register file pins -- HartTp.v).
   The address / stored-value operands are read with [rget m rs]
   (correct at tp too) and stay OUTSIDE the [wp_next] lambda as [let]s:
   they are words computed from the ENTRY map, at the hart we came from,
   while every resource inside the lambda is about the hart we resume on.
   The remaining WpSmodePtMem widths (4/1, base widths) follow this
   template mechanically.                                                *)

  (* A6.58: THE LEDGER APPEND, at the generic width.  Two things changed
     under this wrapper and neither is a repair:

       - [wordw_pointsto]'s bytes ARE the context-indexed bytes already
         (A6.18's payoff, the definition three screens up), so the shim
         crossings the SC text had around the write ([ctx_buf_of_mem] /
         [ctx_buf_to_mem]) were IDENTITIES at this site and are simply
         gone -- which is A6.57's "identities now" theory holding exactly
         where the tier already moved, and nowhere else;

       - [SmodeCorePt.s_win_write] is GONE (A6.33): a store is one APPEND,
         so no value-changing law may move [gen_heap_interp] without
         [tso_interp_of] and the writer's [own_context] beside it.  Its
         successor [wordw_win_store_c] has exactly this shape, and
         [HartSMem.Wobl_ram] is what HANDS the bundle to the write node,
         so nothing new is demanded of the leaf's caller. *)
  (* A6.63'' THE CpuId RE-PARK (tso-port.md §0.20′, found by the M-leg lane

     [own_context] is CpuId-INDEXED, and this helper's callers run INSIDE
     [rename CID into CID0; iIntros (CID Hs)] -- the instruction obligation
     binds a FRESH CpuId and the capability's token is at THAT one, while
     typeclass resolution inside the section silently finds the SECTION
     instance [CID].  A section variable cannot be instantiated from inside
     its own section, so the helper takes its own binder.
     POST-FLIP IT IS NEEDED TWICE: it names the token's hart AND the
     appended message's AUTHOR ([hart_agent cpu_id]).  The failure mode is
     [iExact] refusing two terms that PRINT IDENTICALLY; only
     [Local Set Printing All] shows [@own_context Σ _ CID …] vs [… CID0 …]. *)

         and comes back inside the leaf's payload; [sie_cap] is rebuilt

      (* A6.64 THIS SENTENCE ONCE DID NOT ELABORATE AT ALL.  KEEP THE
         THREE PAYLOAD SPELLINGS BELOW IN AGREEMENT.

         History, because the fix is not what it looks like: this [iApply]
         was killed at 35, 60 and 57 minutes across three sessions, while
         the 195 sentences before it cost 4.57 s in total.  Two diagnoses
         were wrong -- it is NOT that the payload was a duplicated lambda
         (naming it changed nothing), and NOT that the name had to be rigid
         ([clearbody] changed nothing; the RSS plateau matched the
         transparent run to 0.016%).

         THE ACTUAL CAUSE: the payload was spelled DIFFERENTLY at three
         positions of the same forty-argument application --
           * the leaf's [R]           : [Psic] (= own_context ∗ Ψ bs)
           * the obligation argument  : [Mobl_ram_ex … Psic]
           * the NODE argument        : [swp_read_ram_node_w_ex … Ψ]
         The node still handed the PRE-FLIP payload, so unification had to
         discover the relation between [Ψ] and [own_context ∗ Ψ] through
         forty arguments, and diverged.  With the three in agreement the
         application elaborates in 0.042 s and the file compiles in 4.74 s.

         THE RULE: when threading the token into a leaf, move the NODE
         argument too.  A6.58's recipe does not say so, so every S-mode
         leaf that took the token carries this hazard until its node is
         checked.

         The [set] below is kept because it makes the three spellings easy
         to compare by eye -- not because naming is the fix.  The
         [iPoseProof]/[iApply] split is kept for the same reason: it bills
         elaboration separately from goal unification, which is the only
         thing that localises this failure. *)

  (* THE SIDE CONDITION ARRIVES BY INSTANCE RESOLUTION, NOT AS A PREMISE.
     [rget m rs2] is a lookup in [tp_pin m], so the stored value as spelled
     here depends on the ambient hart at exactly one register, rs2 = tp.  Once
     the funnel's σ-callback moves inside [wp_next] the obligation arrives at
     the hart the trap returned TO, while this statement was elaborated at the
     hart we came FROM, and the two agree only away from tp.  This leaf has no
     [rd_ok]/[ops_ok] slot to widen -- a c.sdsp writes no register, so it has
     no pure premises at all -- and it is referenced ~640 times, so an ordinary
     premise would move every one of those call sites.  [IntrDefs.SrcOk] is
     that same side condition delivered as an IMPLICIT class argument: it
     occupies no positional slot, so no call site changes.

     THE STORED VALUE STAYS SPELLED [rget m rs2], at the ENTRY hart, and that
     is deliberate -- see this file's header.  The tempting alternative, making
     the statement literally hart-free as [m !!! Regidx rs2], was MEASURED and
     rejected: it breaks 99 consumer files, because a caller normalises the
     value it gets back with an [iEval (rgne)] / [rewrite H] whose LHS is a
     [rget], and those have nothing to match once the [rget] is gone.  So the
     class carries the side condition and the SPELLING does not move.

     LANDED AHEAD OF ITS CONSUMER, exactly as [IntrDefs.src_ok] was, and for
     the same reason: nothing here needs the reconciliation until the funnel's
     σ-callback moves inside [wp_next] and the obligation starts arriving at
     the rebound hart.  What the class buys is proved, not asserted -- see
     [IntrDefs.src_ok_rget_all] / [src_ok_rget_indep] -- and the point of
     landing it now is that adding it costs ZERO of this leaf's 672 references,
     so the funnel change is not entangled with a 672-site sweep. *)

  (* >>> A6.104: THE FLOOR-FRAMING TWIN OF THE STORE-THEN-MINT GATE.
     [word_pointsto_wpay_mint_c] takes a ctx word and MINTS the racy window
     at its own store's position; this one takes a window that is ALREADY
     minted and gives it back AT THE SAME FLOOR, with only [own] moved.

     That is the whole difference the floor-0 route turns on (A6.101): a
     `.bss` lock's owner field is an era-image cell, so its window can be
     minted at 0 BEFORE [initlock] runs, and [initlock]'s `sd x0` must then
     FRAME that floor rather than set a new one -- which is what makes
     [ctx_floor ξ 0] free at every boot-static handle and breaks the
     bootstrap (the first acquire of the first lock cannot buy its floor).

     NOTHING NEW UNDERNEATH.  [TsoCtxLedger.ledger_store_win_wpay_ok] is the gate
     and it has been in the tree since the M4 unit with NO CLIENT -- its two
     arms were written for exactly these two stores ([initlock]'s and
     release's clear-write take the first; acquire's [lk->cpu = mycpu()]
     takes the second).  All this wrapper adds is the interp bookkeeping
     [lock_word_store_plain] (A6.89) already spells: the pin, the [gs_of]
     bridge, and the [vstep] monotonicity triple. <<< *)

(* KernelDataInv.v -- the kernel global-DATA image resource [kernel_data], the
   read-only analogue of [kernel_text] (KernelText.v).

   [kernel_text] resides the kernel's instruction bytes at their physical
   addresses as persistent code (`↦ₓ□`) points-to facts so that any fetch can
   extract a code window without borrow/return.  [kernel_data] does the same
   for the kernel's initialized global-data image (KernelData.kernel_data, the
   ELF `.data` section): a persistent per-byte resource from which a data load
   extracts a word window, exactly as fetch extracts a code window from
   [kernel_text].  It is the intended mechanism for reading read-only kernel
   globals in a whole-function WP (rather than threading raw `↦₄` hypotheses).

   Like [kernel_text] this is a build LEAF -- importing it gives the data image
   + the word-window lemma without any WP-stack dependency. *)

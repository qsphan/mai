(* SpecUartwrite.v -- the public interface of uartwrite, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a whole-function
   proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in parallel.

     void uartwrite(int uid, char buf[], int n);

   uartwrite is xv6's INTERRUPT-DRIVEN UART output path (the one write() uses,
   as opposed to printk's spinning uartputc_sync).  At XV6_REV 163d39b it
   gained a PORT INDEX: the two 16550s share one `struct uart uarts[2]`, so
   the lock it takes is the FIELD `&uarts[uid].tx_lock`, the channel it parks
   on is the ELEMENT `&uarts[uid]`, and the MMIO window is the word
   `uarts[uid].base` -- LOADED, not a compile-time constant.  It pushes
   [buf[0..n)] into port [i]'s THR one byte at a time, taking and releasing
   that port's tx_lock around each LSR-check/THR-write and sleeping outside it
   whenever the transmitter is busy.

   ONE CONTRACT, PARAMETRIC IN THE PORT.  Nothing here is the console's: the
   registers move (a0 = uid, a1 = buf, a2 = n), the three addresses are
   [UartsFields]'s [uart_f_lock i] / [uart_f_chan i] / [uart_f_base i], and
   the device premise is the BARE [uart_inv i gu] rather than the [dev_inv]
   bundle -- which is also strictly easier for a console caller, who projects
   it with [WpUart.dev_inv_uart].  ONE CONTRACT AT BOTH PORTS: the owner's
   ruling is that nothing has to TRACK port 1's output, not that the THR write
   stops landing, and [WpUart.chist_at Uart1] is [emp] -- so the
   justification premise below is a real obligation at [Uart0] and free at
   [Uart1] ([WpUart.out_chain_triv]), and neither port costs this contract a
   binder of its own.

   @ KernelSyms.uartwrite, 142 bytes, 54 instructions, a 64-byte frame.
   EVERYTHING IS SHRINK-WRAPPED ONTO THE n > 0 PATH now: the `blez a2` is the first
   instruction, before the prologue, so the [n = 0] arm is a bare `ret` that
   touches no stack at all and the eight callee-saved spills (ra, s0-s6) all
   happen on the other side of it.

   THE ALTITUDE is port [i]'s tx_lock ([UartTxInv.is_txlock_at i], over
   [UartTxInv]'s payload).  It is persistent and is the entire credential: it
   carries both the lock (whose resource is the EXCLUSIVE TRANSMITTER TOKEN)
   and the frozen [uart_dlab_off].  Nothing about the transmitter is threaded
   by the caller -- which is forced, not chosen: the token has to be reachable
   by uartintr as well, and the two meet only under the lock.  See UartTxInv.v
   for why the lock is a spinlock again and what a driver that re-acquires per
   byte may claim.

   WHAT THE CONTRACT ASKS ABOUT THE OUTPUT, since lane OUT-FUPD.  Not a
   receipt but a JUSTIFICATION, and a per-BYTE one: uartwrite SLEEPS between
   bytes, and while it sleeps any other hart may push its own (uartputc_sync
   takes the same lock but not for the whole run), so a single view shift over
   the message would be unsound.  The premise is

       WpUart.out_chain i (S gen_id) (f <$> seq 0 n) Phi

   -- one link per byte of the buffer, in order -- and the post is the
   payload [Phi].  The loop carries [drop k] of the chain as its invariant.

   THE BUFFER is taken at an arbitrary [dq] and handed back untouched
   (uartwrite only reads it), named by [f] in strlen's vocabulary.  [n] is a
   [nat]: a caller with a non-positive count has nothing to say and nothing to
   pass, and the C's [n <= 0] guard then IS the [n = 0] arm.

   INTERRUPT LEVEL IS PINNED AT 0, as in pipewrite: sleep parks through
   sched(), whose invariant demands noff = 1 -- tx_lock and nothing else -- so
   uartwrite must be entered with no lock held.  The running-thread bundle
   ([own_ctx] + sched_vc + [procs_inv], SpecSleep.v's shape) rides along for
   the same reason.

(* PORT [i]'s TRANSMIT LOCK is [UartTxInv.is_txlock_at i] -- the same payload
   ([tx_res] + the frozen [uart_dlab_off], both keyed on the ghost bundle and
   neither of them port-dependent) at the lock FIELD `uarts + 40*uid + 16`,
   under the name [uart_lock_name i] that `uartinit` initialised it with.  A
   console caller holding the old [is_txlock] has [is_txlock_at Uart0] by
   definition. *)

(* uartwrite's own frame is 8 slots ([c.addi16sp sp,-64] at the prologue), and
   the deepest callee is [sleep] at 20 (sleep_prepare 14, acquire and release
   10 apiece) -- so the body's first call needs [20 <= av - 8], i.e.
   [av >= 28], and the bound is exactly tight.

   IT WAS 30, over a TEN-slot frame.  163d39b's uartwrite keeps its port
   pointer, its lock pointer and its base pointer in callee-saved registers
   instead of recomputing them, which costs one more spill and saves two
   slots' worth of scratch: the frame is 64 bytes now, so the number drops by
   two.  Before that it was 34, the sleeplock era's figure ([acquiresleep] at
   26 dominated); `d80e61c5` parks OUTSIDE the lock, so [sleep] is the floor.
   Nothing downstream constrains this constant: consolewrite, uartwrite's only
   caller, is unproven. *)

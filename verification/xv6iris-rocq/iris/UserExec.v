(* UserExec.v -- the WP for ARBITRARY user-mode execution: the abstract
   invariant of a valid user-mode machine, the trapped-to-kernel frame, and
   the Löb capstone [wp_user_exec].

   This is the WP that belongs in [wp_userret]'s continuation (WpUserretAll.v):
   once userret sret's to User with the user page table live, the machine may
   keep executing WHATEVER user code the mapped pages hold, forever, with the
   only exit a synchronous trap into the kernel's handler at stvec (uservec).

     [user_inv]        the loop invariant: privilege User, an ARBITRARY pc,
                       ARBITRARY registers, arbitrary trap CSRs, over the
                       user page table bundle [user_pt_any] (UserPtTree.v --
                       owns the PT slots and the process's whole memory
                       [umem_own P M]; [M] -- the abstract state -- is
                       QUANTIFIED here, since arbitrary user code may write
                       arbitrary bytes into its own pages, while its DOMAIN
                       is pinned by the table) and the config [user_cfg].
     [user_trap_frame] the frame handed to the kernel re-entry continuation:
                       privilege Supervisor, pc at stvec's direct base, the
                       trap CSRs written, everything else as in [user_inv].
     [stvec_handler_wp] the assumed kernel re-entry contract: from
                       [user_trap_frame], the kernel handler runs safely.
     [user_step_obligation] ONE machine step from [user_inv] either retires
                       (re-establishing [user_inv]) or traps (producing
                       [user_trap_frame]), both continuations under a later.
     [wp_user_exec]    the Löb induction: step obligation + invariant +
                       handler contract ⊢ WP Loop.

   The step obligation is where all the real work lands; it is discharged by
   the per-step case analysis (interrupt dispatch x fetch trichotomy x decode
   totality [DecodeTotalU/DecodeSetU] x per-family execute outcomes).
   Everything a step can do falls in one of the two continuations:
     - retire: compute/branch/jump (register file changes), loads/stores/AMOs
       to mapped pages (the memory [M] is quantified in [user_pt_any], so a
       store re-establishes it at a new [M]), TLB fills and Svadu A/D write-backs (absorbed by [utlb_inv_pt]);
     - trap TO STVEC: a pending delegated INTERRUPT (see below), ecall/ebreak,
       illegal (incl. all privileged instructions), fetch/load/store page
       faults (unmapped or permission-denied or A/D-update-needed pages),
       misaligned accesses.
   INTERRUPTS CAN PREEMPT ANY STEP: at User privilege the effective SIE is
   architecturally true (unmaskable), and the wire thread (PlicLoop's wire
   step) may raise the external-interrupt wire [sig_seip] concurrently at
   any time.  So the user frame does NOT own the wire cells -- and under
   per-node semantics it does not have to BORROW them either: the dispatch
   reads [sig_meip]/[sig_seip] as forall-BOUND reads
   ([WpMmodeCsrSwp.swp_read_reg_any], which needs no ownership at all), so
   the wire value simply lives in the payload of the dispatch's answer.
   THE TWO PLIC WIRES ARE THE ONLY REGISTERS A USER CYCLE READS THAT THE
   HART DOES NOT OWN (the enumeration is section 1.4 of the port plan);
   everything else -- mip, mcycle, mtime and minstret included -- is owned
   outright by [user_regs] through [MinstretInv.clock_res]/[minstret_res].
   Consequently the user tier needs NEITHER [WireInv.wire_inv] NOR
   [MinstretInv.clock_inv], and every invariant borrow this file used to
   carry is gone.  Each step case-splits on the dispatch decision
   ([u_dispatch], UserStep.v): pending-and-enabled delegated interrupt ->
   the interrupt trap to stvec (Supervisor), which is just another producer
   of [user_trap_frame]; none -> fetch/execute.  [uc_mm] (mie & ~mideleg =
   0, a boot constant) only rules out M-DESTINED interrupts, so every
   dispatched interrupt goes to Supervisor.                                *)

     now owns minstret/minstret_increment/mcycle/mtime/mip outright: there is
     no clock invariant left to borrow mip from, and the reservation frag is
     what [HartMemRun.swp_hmrun_of_exec] consumes and hands back at every
     model call.  Their values are existential per step, which is exactly
     what [clock_res]/[minstret_res] say, so nothing in this file's
     statements has to name them.
     WHY NOT [pc_is]: [InstrBytes.pc_is x] bundles the same three riders but
     FORCES PC = nextPC, and the WAITING hart decouples them (the enter-wait
     step skips the tick).  [UserFrame.u_regs_pc_is] is the bridge back for
     the two boundaries that still speak [pc_is]. *)

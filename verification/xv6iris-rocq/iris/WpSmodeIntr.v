(* WpSmodeIntr.v -- the SIE=1 instruction step engine and the SIE-AGNOSTIC
   funnel over [sconf] + [sie_cap], at the PER-NODE layer.

   LAYER 1 [wp_instr_s_intr] IS [WpIntrInv.wp_exec_step_intr] VERBATIM.  The
   engine already speaks the bundle, so the wrapper is one [exact]; it is kept
   as a name because [wp_instr_s_sconf]'s '1' arm and 68 call sites use it.

   LAYER 2 [wp_instr_s_sconf]: THE SIE-AGNOSTIC FUNNEL.  It cases on the
   capability's SIE INDEX [b] -- an index, not an internal disjunction, so a
   caller can say which arm it is in -- and BOTH arms present the SAME
   leaf-facing obligation [sconf_step_obl], which is why everything above this
   file is SIE-blind:
     - [b = true]: [wp_instr_s_intr].  The sret-target premise is DERIVED from
       [instr_bytes]' 2-alignment ([update_bit0_zero_of_aligned2]), so no call
       site carries it;
     - [b = false]: [wp_instr_s_sconf_off_clock], which inlines the cycle
       ([HartSwp.swp_loop] + [HartMCycle.swp_tick_wrap_ex]) so that the
       callback's outermost [▷] is stripped BEFORE the body is supplied,
       runs [WpIntrInv.swp_run_hart_active_instr_S_res] at the regime
       residue, and refutes the dispatch from the capability's SIE ghost.
       See the note at the lemma for why it is not
       [SmodeCorePt.wp_instr_s_config_regime] instead.

   WHAT THE PER-NODE PORT CHANGED IN THE SHAPES, and why:
     - the leaf hands the bundles BACK inside the [swp (execute i)]
       postcondition, and its continuation is a separate rider-indexed
       premise.  The wrapper needs [sconf]'s and [sie_cap]'s CELLS for the
       cycle's own boundary / prelude / tick, so the leaf borrows them for the
       instruction rather than keeping them;
     - the whole callback sits under ONE outermost [▷].  The cycle offers
       exactly one later ([HartMCycle.wp_loop_cycle_ex]'s body) and only what
       is in the context when that [iNext] runs can be stripped; a [▷] inside
       the callback would arrive through the rider, after it.  Outermost is
       also the WEAKEST premise ([P ⊢ ▷ P]), so no caller pays for the move;
     - the leaf is given [resv_any cpu_id], not [resv_frag cpu_id None]: the
       walking fetch's PTE read is EXCLUSIVE and supersedes the boundary's
       clear.

   AND ONE PREMISE CHANGE, in [wp_gpr_write_s_sconf] / [_base]: the
   [forall s_pc, <lookups> -> exec (execute base) s_pc = ...] premise became a
   [swp] obligation.  It had to.  An [exec] fact constrains the START state
   only, while a per-node walk may be interfered with BETWEEN nodes, so
   nothing bridges the two -- and the exec premise cannot be re-derived,
   because a footprint walker cannot run an instruction at a SYMBOLIC register
   index, which is what [rd] / [rsa] / [rsb] are here.  Every other statement
   in the file is byte-identical, [wp_cli_s_sconf] included.

   The bundle owns [gpr_file (tp_pin m)] (HartTp.v), so the engines below are
   fed [tp_pin m] as THEIR map; [sie_cap] stays stated at [m] (it depends on
   it only through sp, which the pin does not move).  All the leaves hand
   their continuation back through [wp_next b] -- with interrupts enabled the
   instruction can be trapped and the thread resumed on a DIFFERENT hart, and
   the rebound [CID] binder makes every resource about that hart.  That is
   also why the READ side of [ops_ok] exists, and why the instruction's own
   obligation is ∀-quantified over the hart: [tp_pin] is hart-indexed.

   TWO CpuId INSTANCES IN ONE CONTEXT IS A REAL HAZARD, and it is what the
   [rename CID into CID0] dance leaves behind.  After the rename BOTH harts
   are ordinary context entries of class [CpuId], and resolution for a lemma
   or a term written by HAND may pick either -- the failure is an [iApply]
   that "cannot apply" a goal printing identically to the one it was given.
   Terms coming from a STATEMENT are fine (they were elaborated at the right
   hart); anything spelled out after the rename takes an explicit
   [(CID := ...)], including inside its arguments ([tp_pin (CID := CID) m]). *)

  (* THE SIE=0 ARM, PROVED HERE RATHER THAN ON [SmodeCorePt]'s WRAPPER.
     The wrapper ([wp_instr_s_config_regime]) now has everything this arm
     needs on the leaf side -- the borrowed [clock_res] and an existential
     post mstatus/mideleg, which this funnel cannot do without (csrci/csrsi
     sstatus and sret MOVE SIE, and at [b = false] moving it IS the
     [b' = true] transition) -- but not the LATER.  This funnel takes its
     callback under one outermost [▷], because the cycle offers exactly one
     and a [▷] inside the callback would arrive through the rider, after it;
     the wrapper takes its leaf obligation with no [▷] at all, and the only
     later in the whole chain ([HartSwp.swp_loop]'s) is stripped three
     layers inside it -- i.e. after the obligation has had to be handed
     over.  [▷ (swp e Φ) ⊢ swp e Φ] does not hold, so there is no way to
     supply it from outside.

     So this arm INLINES [HartMCycle.wp_loop_cycle_ex]'s own two lines
     ([swp_loop] then [swp_tick_wrap_ex]) and takes that later HERE.  The
     rest is the SIE=1 engine's plumbing with the trap arm deleted:
       - the bundle opens into the cells ([WpIntrInv.sconf_to_cells] and
         [WpIntrInv.sie_cap_frame_acc]).  The SLOT is where the two
         translation arms are told apart, and this is the only funnel that
         has to: the accessor hands out [s_tlb_at SD] rather than the tlb
         cell, so the Bare slot before kvminithart need not fund one;
       - SIE=0 is read off the capability's ghost quarter, which is what
         the index [b = false] MEANS, and it makes [s_dispatch] [None] --
         so the run rule's trap payload is instantiated at [False];
       - the body is [WpIntrInv.swp_run_hart_active_instr_S_res] at the KPT
         arm and [_res_b] at the Bare one -- two CONCRETE branches, because
         a write set in a parameter position makes the [iApply] diverge --
         and the rider is [WpIntrInv.intr_ret] with the slot's closer
         beside it ([off_ret]): the frames go back at the landing tower and
         the non-cell residue rides beside them. *)

(* PipeReg.v -- THE REGISTRY: a pipe row's exit payment as a PERSISTENT
   handle, so a verified program may hold a pipe without the taint.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-pipe.md SS2 ("A verified
   program holds a pipe: the REGISTRY replaces the taint"), which closes
   the two items claude-notes/completed/pipe-queue.md left under "Open,
   recorded".

   THE WALL IT REMOVES.  kexit closes every descriptor a dying process
   holds, so exit(2)'s bundle row is [SpecFileclose.fileclose_cpays] of the
   key's whole table -- and at a PIPE row that payment is
   [PipeQueue.pipe_cpay], a close LINK (buildable only by the holder of the
   pipe's exclusive queue fragment) or the TAINT.  Until now the only
   PERSISTENT way to answer was the taint, so a program that called pipe(2)
   gave up being verified-and-untainted ([UkRunSys.wp_uk_ecall_pipe] took
   [app_taint] as a premise).  Two things made the fragment itself
   unusable there: it is exclusive, while the exit row is a [∗ list] of
   INDEPENDENT payments (sh holds BOTH ends right after pipe(2), so two
   rows name one pipe), and it cannot cross exec.

   THE READING THAT PAYS.  What a run carries per row is not the fragment
   but a [□]-guarded payment at EITHER END -- the registry.  Being under a
   [□] it is buildable any number of times, which is exactly what two rows
   on one pipe, a dup'd row and a forked child's copy of the table all
   need; and holding one says nothing about where the fragment lives, which
   is the application's business (lane PIPE-PROTO puts it in a per-pipe
   invariant and derives the registry from the invariant's handle).

   WHERE IT IS SPENT: [UexecExecInst.xv6_sbundle_exit_regs] mints exit's
   bundle row from one instance of each row's registry, and
   [UexecSG.srow_reg] is the CLASS FIELD through which [UkRun.urun_nopipe]
   -- which lives below every pipe ghost -- names it.  See this lane's
   finding in claude-notes/projects/app-pipe.md for why the field exists.

   VACUITY, FIRST (durable-notes.md, "Vacuity").  [pipe_reg] must not be
   free, or the wall would have been an illusion and every exit row would
   be paid by nothing.  It is not free, and the argument is mechanised
   below as [pipe_reg_not_free]: firing a close link moves the pipe's
   AUTHORITY, and a link at the trivial payload gives nothing back, so a
   link conjured from [emp] would move the authority away from a fragment
   that did not move -- which [PipeQueue.pipe_queue_agree] refutes at any
   state whose flag the close actually clears.  The two real sources are
   therefore the ones named here ([pipe_reg_of_taint]) and in lane
   PIPE-PROTO ([pipe_reg_of_inv]).  What CANNOT be mechanised in Rocq is
   the statement "[⊢ pipe_reg γp] is not derivable" itself -- it is a
   meta-level claim about the logic, not a proposition of it -- so the
   refutation is stated at the one step the derivation would have to take.

   NOT TIMELESS, and deliberately so: [pipe_cpay] is a disjunction whose
   left arm is a fupd-producing wand, and no [□] makes that timeless.  No
   consumer of [UkRun.urun_nopipe] strips a later off it (this lane
   checked every site), so nothing asks for it. *)

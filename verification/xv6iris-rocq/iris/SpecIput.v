   ONE module type, [IPUT], proven by [ProofIput.v] and instantiated with no
   axiom at all by [LinkIput.v].  (Until C6b there were two: an older
   [emp]-shaped statement written when there was no inode model, bridged to
   the callers by an [Axiom] in [LinkIputCompat.v].  Both are gone -- the
   callers now carry real references, so the frozen statement had no
   consumers left.  git history has it if it is ever wanted.)

   ==== WHAT THE CONTRACT SAYS ==========================================

   iput DESTROYS one inode reference: [IcacheRef.inode_ref k q
   dev inum] goes in and nothing comes back but one [iref_slot], the
   ledger unit that makes iget/iput a matched pair against the fixed
   IREFSLOTS supply.  On the last close of an unlinked inode it also
   TRUNCATES -- which is why the whole log/bitmap/inode-region environment
   is here (the bitmap itself is the persistent [BitmapInv.bitmap_inv]:
   the truncate arm frees into it and says nothing), and why the
   budget clause is a spend-at-most interval: [log_op] moves only through
   [LogInv.log_spend_step] against the ledger authority inside log.lock,
   and iput never takes that lock, so it cannot hand a surplus back.

   iput SLEEPS -- acquiresleep on the inode, and bread underneath itrunc /
   iupdate -- so it threads the running-process bundle exactly as
   SpecBalloc.v / SpecIupdate.v do: procs_inv / p_pid, the disk fabric,
   three buffer slots, and the parking premise [eb = true].  The bundle is
   UNCONDITIONAL: xv6's iput always MAY truncate and no caller can know in
   advance which arm runs.  It enters and returns at noff 0.

   Two below-icache blockers were found by tracing the proof forward and
   both are ruled on (design §13.12):

     (B1) iput calls acquiresleep at noff = 1 (itable.lock held), and the
          blocking [SpecAcquiresleep] demands [cpu_own 0 ...].  SETTLED, and
          not by the route this note first took: the truncate arm calls
          [wp_acquiresleep_nb_sconf], the NON-BLOCKING contract, which never
          reaches the sleeping branch at all -- REF-1 says no share of the
          entry's "may hold" right exists, so nobody holds the lock
          (claude-notes/projects/iput-acquiresleep.md).  The earlier plan
          leaned on the sleeping branch being panic("sched locks"); that
          contract is gone, because nothing that CAN sleep may be entered at
          noff != 0.  NOTHING in this statement changes because of it.

     (B2) SpecItrunc's [forall i < MAXFILE, length (data i) = BSIZE] is not
          derivable: [data] is EXISTENTIAL inside [ic_loaded], and
          [inode_ok] pinned lengths only at HOLES ([blk_holes_zero]).
          FIXED AND LANDED (a791194a): [InodeInv.inode_sized] IS
          [inode_ok]'s seventh conjunct, so iput derives the premise from
          the checked-out bundle at the call site.  NO premise appears
          below for it, and SpecItrunc is unchanged.                      *)

   [bmapstart ∈ Sb'], because spending that unit and logging that block are
   one event.  A walker needs exactly this pairing: [crb] tells level i+1
   nothing unless level i reported whether it paid.  At [crb = true] the
   report is always [false] (itrunc's paid disjunct pins the level), so a
   credited caller never sees its own credit spent back at it. *)

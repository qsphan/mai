(* UartTxInv.v -- the UART transmitter's software side: what serializes the
   writers, and the two trace lemmas a driver needs to read the accepted-byte
   history out of [dev_inv].

   Geometry (uart.c's two remaining file-static objects):

     a_tx_lock   -- &tx_lock   (a struct SPINLOCK; it serializes every THR
                                write -- uartwrite's and uartputc_sync's)
     a_tx_chan   -- &tx_chan   (int: its ADDRESS is the sleep channel; the
                                cell itself is never read or written, so
                                nothing here owns it)

   WHAT THE LOCK PROTECTS ([tx_res]) IS NOW ONE THING: the EXCLUSIVE
   TRANSMITTER TOKEN [uart_tx_own γu l] (WpUart.v) -- the right to push a byte
   into THR, and the statement that the accepted trace is exactly [l].

   THE CERTIFICATE THAT USED TO LIVE HERE IS GONE, and that is the whole
   change.  The old uart.c drove the transmitter by BEING TOLD it was idle:
   uartintr checked LSR.THRE and cleared a [tx_busy] flag, and uartwrite's THR
   store was licensed by the lock invariant's implication "tx_busy == 0 ⟹
   everything accepted has been transmitted" -- the software's record of
   somebody else's THRE observation.  That is what forced the token into a
   lock shared with the interrupt handler, and it is what this file existed to
   state.

   The new uart.c POLLS THRE ITSELF, immediately before every byte:

       sleep_prepare(&tx_chan);
       if (ReadReg(LSR) & LSR_TX_IDLE) { WriteReg(THR, buf[i]); i += 1; }
       else                            { sleep(); }

   so the store is licensed by [uart_tx_poll_thre] applied to the writer's own
   LSR read -- uartputc_sync's route -- and needs no invariant at all.  With
   the certificate goes the flag ([tx_busy] no longer exists), and with the
   flag goes the reason uartintr had to reach the token: the handler now only
   observes LSR and calls wakeup(&tx_chan), which moves no device ghost.  The
   two functions no longer meet in a shared resource; they meet in the sleep
   channel.

   *** THE D2 OBSTRUCTION IS GONE. ***  This paragraph used to say [is_txlock]
   was not constructible at boot: `ae96fd0` made tx_lock a sleeplock and
   deleted uartinit's [initlock(&tx_lock,"uart")] without replacing it, so the
   zeroed [name] fields were NULL POINTERS and no address in this model's
   memory map could satisfy [lock_name] (kernel-defects.md D2, which we
   reported).  Upstream fixed it -- `b7c25cf` added [initsleeplock], and
   `d80e61c5` settled on [initlock(&tx_lock, "uart")] with tx_lock back to a
   spinlock -- so the name is written and [lock_name] is satisfiable.

   The boot chain now carries the storage end to end: [main_locks_raw] hands
   [lk_raw a_tx_lock] down through consoleinit into uartinit, which returns
   [lk_fresh a_tx_lock "uart"], and [newlock] turns that into the [is_lock]
   half of [is_txlock] below.  What is still owed is only the boot ASSEMBLY
   that runs that step -- a [WpLock.newlock] -- and the resource it
   must supply, [tx_res], which is the printk cone's business now that
   [SpecPrintk.pr_res] no longer holds the transmitter. *)

  (* [tx_lock] and [tx_chan] LEFT THE SYMBOL TABLE at 163d39b: the kernel's
     two UARTs share one `struct uart uarts[2]` in .data, so the lock is a
     FIELD of the element (`&uarts[uid].tx_lock` = `uarts + 40*uid + 16`) and
     the sleep channel is the ELEMENT ITSELF (`sleep_prepare(u)` with
     `u = &uarts[uid]`).  The stride and the field offset are read off
     [uartputc_sync]'s own arithmetic -- `((uid*4 + uid) << 3) + 16 + uarts`
     for the lock, and `uartinit` passing `uarts + 0x28` for `&uarts[1]`.
     This file is the CONSOLE port's; the second port's pair is the same
     arithmetic at uid = 1, and everything below is stated at both ([_at]
     forms) with the console port's spelling kept as the abbreviation.

     AND THE LOCK'S NAME MOVED WITH IT.  [uartinit] now calls
     [initlock(&u->tx_lock, name)] with the literals "uart0"/"uart1"; the
     old single "uart" is gone from `.rodata`.  So [is_txlock]'s name is
     [uart_lock_name Uart0] = "uart0".  [LockRank.v]'s rank table and every
     [locks_below lks "uart"] premise in the printk / uartwrite /
     uartputc_sync cones name the OLD string and are a separate lane's to
     rename -- nothing here can do it without touching those files. *)

     persistent and survives the release. *)

  Proof using . iIntros "H". by iExists l. Qed.

  (* ---- the lock.  [uart_dlab_off] rides along because it is persistent and
     every THR write needs it: offset 0 is the divisor latch, not THR, while
     DLAB is set, so "the byte was transmitted" is false without it.  A client
     that holds the lock therefore holds everything the store leaf wants.

     A SPINLOCK AGAIN, and the reason the sleeplock existed is gone.  It was a
     sleeplock because the old uartwrite parked BETWEEN bytes while holding the
     transmitter, which a spinlock cannot do (sched() demands noff = 1).  The
     `verified` branch's uartwrite takes and releases the lock AROUND EACH
     LSR-check/THR-write pair and parks outside it:

         sleep_prepare(&tx_chan);
         acquire(&tx_lock);
         if (LSR & TX_IDLE) { WriteReg(THR, buf[i]); release(...); i++; }
         else               { release(...); sleep(); }

     so nothing is held across the park and one ghost suffices.  uartputc_sync
     takes the same lock, which is what makes the two transmit paths agree --
     and is why [SpecPrintk.pr_res] no longer needs the transmitter at all.

     THE COST IS BORNE BY THE CALLERS' TRACE CLAIM, not by this predicate:
     a driver that re-acquires per byte cannot claim a CONTIGUOUS
     [uart_sent], because another hart may interleave between two of its
     bytes.  That is what [WpUart.out_chain] is for (lane OUT-FUPD). *)

  (* THE SUBLIST CLAIM IS RETIRED (lane OUT-FUPD, F4).  It said --
     "these bytes went out, in order, possibly interleaved with another

     uartputc_sync, consputc, uartwrite, consolewrite and filewrite handed
     back.  Under the owner's redesign a writer does not RECEIVE a claim
     about what came out, it BRINGS the justification for putting it out
     ([WpUart.out_link] / [WpUart.out_chain], one link per byte, invoked at
     the store), and the consequence lives in the console UART's own
     invariant.  Nothing above the driver reads a trace any more, so the
     definition, its free unit and its snoc step are gone with it.

     WHAT STAYS is [uart_sent] itself, just below: the device's own
     monotone record of the accepted sequence, which the THR leaf's ghost
     step still produces and [UartAccepted]/[SystemUartAccepted] still read
     at the ledger.

     ...AND ITS FREE UNIT COMES HERE, from the retired [UartSentLoc.v]: the

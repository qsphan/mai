       sz = p->sz;
       if (n > 0) {

   @ KernelSyms.growproc = 0x80001c0a, 37 instructions / 98 bytes; a 32-byte
   frame with all four slots used (ra / s0 / s1 = n / s2 = p).

   THE ALTITUDE.  growproc is a [proc_priv] consumer whose body is two calls
   stated one tier DOWN, over the bare [p->sz] / [p->pagetable] cells plus
   [ProcPtOwn.proc_pt] (SpecUvmalloc.v / SpecUvmdealloc.v).
   [ProcInv.proc_priv_addrspace] is that bridge, and unlike fetchaddr's
   [proc_priv_copy] BOTH halves move: growproc is the function that writes
   [p->sz], and the invariant tying the size to the map has to be
   re-established at the new pair.

   WHY THIS FUNCTION HAS NO PREMISE ABOUT ITS ARGUMENT, AND NONE ABOUT THE
   TABLE.  Both are consequences of [proc_priv]'s two size conjuncts
   (ProcInv.v), and neither could have been a premise -- a caller at this
   altitude holds nothing else:

   - [uvmalloc] must be told the run [PGROUNDUP(sz) .. sz+n) is FRESH (else
     mappages panics on a remap, and the OOM rollback is not exact).
     growproc pays that out of [um_below (pv_sz V)]: nothing is mapped at or
     above [p->sz], and the run starts at PGROUNDUP(p->sz).  This is the
     invariant the whole coherence apparatus exists for.
   - [n] is unconstrained.  Every arm is total in it, including the one
     where [sz + n] WRAPS ([sbrk(-1)] on a zero-sized process computes
     2^64 - 1): the C reaches uvmdealloc with that value and uvmdealloc
     returns [oldsz] unchanged, which is exactly what [uvmd_np]'s guard
     makes the contract say.

   THE POSTCONDITION IS THE C's FOUR PATHS, and the return value determines
   which: -1 means NOTHING moved (both failure arms roll back exactly, the
   second because uvmalloc's own contract does), 0 means the size moved to
   [szv'] and the table with it.  The three 0-arms are distinguished by the
   sign of [n] and are mutually exclusive, so a caller reads off exactly one.

   AMBIGUITY THE MACHINE HAS AND THE CONTRACT DOES NOT.  The C tests
   uvmalloc's result against 0, which is also what uvmalloc returns on a
   zero-length SUCCESS -- but not here: on this arm [n > 0] and
   [p->sz <= TRAPFRAME], so the new size is strictly positive and [beqz] can
   only mean failure.  The contract states the unambiguous reading. *)

(* growproc's own frame is 4 slots; uvmalloc wants 42 below it (mappages 32,

(*   [szv] / [P] are the size and descriptor on entry, [szv'] / [P'] the
   ones on exit, and [r] the returned a0.  Four arms, one per path through
   the C; the [P' = P] ones say the table is untouched down to the
   descriptor RECORD, not merely up to [proc_pt].

   THE IMAGE, [M] IN AND [M'] OUT, IS A FUNCTION OF THE SIZE CHANGE ALONE.
   At the LAZY [proc_ptm] view (ProcDefs.v's "THE MEMORY CONJUNCT IS THE
   LAZY VIEW": a page the process has not faulted in yet already reads as
   zero in [M], so no kalloc'd page ever shows through, and vmfault is a
   noop on [M]) growproc's whole effect on memory is [p->sz] moving:
   growth exposes more already-zero bytes ([UserPtTree.umem_grow], the same
   equation [SpecUvmalloc.wp_uvmalloc_mem_sconf] states at [uvmalloc]'s own
   altitude), a shrink drops the run above [PGROUNDUP(sz+n)]
   ([UserPtTree.umem_del], [SpecUvmdealloc.wp_uvmdealloc_mem_sconf]'s own
   equation), and the failed and unchanged arms move nothing.  So each of
   the four arms below pins [M'] exactly as it already pins [P'] and
   [szv']. *)

  (* (2) GREW -- n > 0 and the new size fits under TRAPFRAME.  The map
     gained precisely the run [PGROUNDUP(sz) .. sz+n); which pages kalloc
     returned is not determined, so [P'] is pinned by extension + domain,
     exactly as uvmalloc's own success arm pins it.  The image gained
     exactly the zeros that became readable at the new size.

     THE EXTENSION IS [uptd_ext_sz], not bare [uptd_ext], and the size
     ordering is stated beside it.  Both are for sbrk's caller: the
     dispatcher's row ([SpecSyscall.sysc_sbrk_ok]) says the address space
     went UP, and the U tier's permission row needs to know that every leaf
     the map GAINED is vmfault's own RW-user leaf inside the new size --
     which is exactly what uvmalloc guarantees (growproc passes PTE_W, so
     the leaf is [uvm_pte 22 _]) and what
     [UserPerm.perm_of_uptd_ext_sz] consumes.  A bare [uptd_ext] cannot get
     there: [upt_acc_wf] permits R+X user leaves. *)

     the old size -- one disjunct, and the only place [n]'s unboundedness

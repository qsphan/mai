(* FsAbsDefs.v -- THE PURE LAYER OF FsAbs.v, HOISTED.

   This file is FsAbs.v's sections 1-2 and section 3a's [abs_view], moved
   here VERBATIM on 2026-09-04 (a pure hoist: no statement changed, no proof
   touched).  FsAbs.v does [Require Export FsAbsDefs], so every consumer of
   FsAbs sees the same names bound to the same constants; nothing landed
   moved (R10).

   WHY A SEPARATE FILE.  Everything below is pure -- [absnode]/[anode]/
   [aview], [abs_of] as a reading of [FsStateInode]'s readings, the bridge
   to [FsTree.fsnode], the hop-by-hop lookup [apath_at], the visited-inum
   run [arun], and [abs_view] (the raw γtop map read through [abs_of]).
   None of it mentions a ghost, Σ, or an iProp; FsAbs.v's sections 3-5 do.

   THE VIEW IS OVER LIVE ROWS ONLY (lane E2-V, 2026-09-05, owner's ruling
   Q-a of claude-notes/projects/app-round-e2.md; sharpened by lane E2-V2 the
   same day, ruling Q-d): [abs_of : fs_node -> option anode] is [None] at a
   FREE inode ([fn_type n = 0]) AND at an inode with NO LINKS
   ([fn_nlink n = 0]), and [Some (abs_row n)] otherwise; [abs_view I :=
   omap abs_of I] -- so fs-syscall-specs section 4's [∃ i ∉ dom av] is
   statable, δ_free is [delete], and iput's free / ialloc's claim are
   VIEW-PRESERVING (the row is absent on both sides).  The filter is on the
   TYPE AND THE COUNT: an unlinked-but-open inode is no longer part of the
   file system a user can name, so it has no row; what an fd-holder still
   sees of it is the fd row's business, not the view's (Q-d's accepted
   cost: the read/write/open observations state their row CONDITIONALLY on
   the count, [arow_at]).  [abs_row] is the total typed reading the fires
   and pins name as an [anode] term.
   Files BELOW [ProcInv] that must STATE something over [aview]/[abs_view]
   -- FsAbsInv's application license, FsAbsDelta's write deltas -- can now
   require this file alone instead of FsAbs's ghost cone.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/fs-syscall-specs.md sections 1-3
   (v3).  The prose that belongs to each definition travelled with it; the
   file-level history (why [abs_view] is over the RAW map, why [apath_at]
   is not spelled [path_at], what the seam attempt found) is in FsAbs.v's
   header, which remains the design's home.

   REQUIRES: FsAbs.v's block minus [Xv6Cameras] (only the ghost sections
   need the camera classes).  [FsState] stays an Export, as in FsAbs.v:
   the readings this file packages ([fn_is_dir], [dir_entries],
   [fn_file_bytes], [fn_nlink]) are FsStateInode's. *)

   arm, an unlinked-but-open file, a removed directory that is still
   someone's cwd.  So fs-syscall-specs section 4's [∃ i ∉ dom av] is

   2a.  THE RUN: a walk's answer, index by index

   [apath_at] is the ANSWER; a pinned walk needs the inums it VISITS, one
   per hop, because the client's shares are per-inum and the walk's hop
   family is indexed by hop number ([SpecNameiTr.nx_hops_from] is a
   [big_sepL] over the path elements).  [arun av d ps ds] is exactly that
   list: [ds] is [d] followed by each hop's answer, so [length ds =
   S (length ps)] and [ds !!! length ps] is [apath_at]'s answer.

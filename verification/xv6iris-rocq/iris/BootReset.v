(* THE GOAL SHAPE: "running [P] from register file [rs] lands in SOME file

   IT IS AN INDUCTIVE, NOT A [Definition] OVER [ex], AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.
   With a transparent definition, an [apply] whose constructor does not match
   does not just fail: the unifier unfolds the definition, meets
   [exec P <the state>], and starts EVALUATING the interpreter over the write
   tower -- minutes per step, no error, and (worse) it can succeed with the
   state argument instantiated to a half-reduced [set_reg] tower, after which
   every later step is off the rails.  An inductive head cannot be unfolded, so
   a wrong step fails immediately. *)

   flagged at 6fe694ea (both `peel.`: exec_config_is_valid, 15.06s CI / 20.2s
   isolated here; exec_init_model's first peel, 3.9s).  On
   exec_config_is_valid, with [phnf] tried before the named-blocker checks,
   roughly HALF of [phnf]'s own time was calls that made NO PROGRESS -- the
   goal was already in whnf (a [to_bits_checked]/[eq_vec] blocker sitting at
   the surface with nothing left to unfold), so [hnf] spent several seconds
   walking the term only to discover that and fall through to
   [pcrack]/[pvm_named] anyway, which then closed it in under 5ms every time.
   [pcrack]/[pvm_named]/[punfold] are a syntactic [match goal with
   context[...]] against a handful of NAMED heads, not a search over the
   whole context (playbook shape #6's `set_solver`-in-a-wide-context trap does
   not apply here), so trying them before [phnf] costs ~0 when they don't
   apply and skips the expensive failed [hnf] entirely when they do.

   actually drives most steps.  Result: exec_config_is_valid's [peel.]

   noise): re-run with the same per-branch [time] instrumentation, its [phnf]
   calls succeed 42 times out of 43 -- there is no wasted branch here to
   reorder away.  That peel's cost is instead ~141 [pdispatch] calls into
   [lkres], each walking a [register_set] nest that is one layer deeper than
   the last (this phase's own writes stack on top of [board_init]'s ten), so
   the per-lookup cost grows with how many prior writes a miss has to skip --
   exactly the "OPEN base" tower cost this file's header says the kit cannot
   avoid, just not yet doubled into an unresolved-read explosion.  Left as
   is: not a [pstep]-ordering problem, and reshaping [regstate]/[lkres] to

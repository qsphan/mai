(* SpecVirtioDiskRw.v -- the public interface of virtio_disk_rw, stated
   independently of its proof.

   virtio_disk_rw(b, write) moves ONE 1024-byte block between the caller's
   buffer cache entry [b] and the disk.  The headline of the spec is the
   DISK POINTS-TO exchange:

     write = 0 (READ):   { disk_block bno data }  ->  { disk_block bno data
                            ∗ b->data holds data }
     write ≠ 0 (WRITE):  { disk_block bno old ∗ b->data holds new }
                         ->  { disk_block bno new ∗ b->data still new }

   Concurrency is entirely inside the two shared structures the spec merely
   references: the vdisk_lock's resource [disk_res] (DiskInv.v) and the
   device invariant [dev_inv] whose [virtio_proto] half carries the DMA
   lease and the per-request protocol (VirtioProto.v).  Nothing about other
   requests appears here.

   The function sleeps twice (descriptor exhaustion; completion), so it
   threads the full sleep/wakeup plumbing of SpecSleep.v: the process
   identity (γs, j), procs_inv, the running-thread bundle.
   It enters at noff 0 (acquire raises to 1, which is what sleep demands)
   and returns at noff 0. *)

  (* THE CRASH PERMIT (claude-notes/design/fs-log.md stage 4; PermInv.v).
     The caller supplies its own logically-atomic view shift over the crash
     predicate, curried with the write's identity and its own ghosts; the
     driver deposits it in the permit channel at the publish, and the DMA
     COMPLETION -- the instant this request's bytes reach the durable image
     -- runs it.  [Q] is the caller's RECEIPT, and it comes back below.
     THE PERMIT IS INDEXED BY THIS REQUEST'S WRITE (phase C2a): a READ moves
     no disk byte, so its index is [None] and [disk_write_permit_trivial]
     still proves it for an ARBITRARY crash predicate -- every read caller is
     unchanged.  A WRITE's index is the block this call is about
     ([1024 * bno], BSIZE bytes), which is what lets the caller's fupd be
     about its OWN block and what the DMA completion discharges from the
     published slot ([VirtioQueue.vs_wr]).  A caller with no durability
     obligation instantiates the pair trivially and its statement is
     unchanged in meaning. *)
  (* ONE SEQUENTIAL PERMIT (claude-notes/completed/sector-atomic-disk.md §6e).
     A 512-byte SECTOR is atomic and a 1024-byte BLOCK is not, so this request
     has one linearization point per sector -- but the caller owes ONE object,
     not a bag of independent view shifts: a conjunction over the sectors
     still to land, each branch's receipt being the residual obligation for
     the rest, and the leaf (the completion, which moves no disk byte) the
     identity permit delivering [Q].  The device picks the order, so the [∧]
     is what the caller proves from the SAME resources; whatever a later
     sector needs travels down the chain.  A READ has no sectors, so
     [disk_seq_permit gen_id None Q] IS [disk_write_permit gen_id None Q]
     ([disk_seq_permit_none]) and every read caller is textually unchanged --
     [disk_write_permit_trivial] still proves it for an ARBITRARY crash
     predicate. *)

(* SpecIunlockput.v -- the public interface of iunlockput.

     void iunlockput(struct inode *ip) {
       iunlock(ip);
       iput(ip);
     }

   32 bytes, 14 instructions: a 4-slot frame, [s1 := a0], two [jal]s, the
   epilogue.  NO branch, NO panic, NO memory access of its own -- the whole
   contract is the COMPOSITION of SpecIunlock's and SpecIput's, and the only
   thing this file has to get right is the seam between them.

   ---- THE SEAM: A SHARE COMES BACK, A REFERENCE GOES IN ----------------

   iunlock (v3) returns the caller's SHARE -- [IcacheRef.inode_shr k s dev
   inum] -- because that is what ilock deposited.  iput spends a canonical
   REFERENCE -- [IcacheRef.inode_ref k q dev inum], all three fractions
   equal (design §14.6(1)).  A share is deliberately not spendable, so the
   two do NOT compose on their own.

   What closes the gap is the PARENT the caller kept back when it carved the
   share off for ilock: [IcacheRef.inode_ref_short k (qi + s) qi dev inum].
   [IcacheRef.inode_ref_gather] puts the two halves together into
   [inode_ref k (qi + s) dev inum] at exactly the instruction between the two
   calls, and that is the reference iput consumes.  So the precondition here
   is

     SpecIunlock's precondition  ∗  the retained short parent
                                 ∗  SpecIput's environment,

   and the postcondition is SpecIput's verbatim -- one [iref_slot] back, the
   bitmap possibly smaller, the budget spent-at-most, and NOTHING inode-shaped
   at all: the reference is gone and the caller's pointer is dead.

   This is the shape every namex-style caller has: it ilocks a directory it
   holds a reference to (carving a share), looks a name up, and iunlockputs.
   The carve is [IcacheRef.inode_ref_shed] (or [inode_ref_carve] at a chosen
   fraction); the gather happens INSIDE this function, so a caller never has
   to name [inode_ref_short] again after the call.

   ---- WHAT IS INHERITED VERBATIM ---------------------------------------

   Every premise below is one of the two callees'.  In particular:

   - [trap_csrs_ext eb] / [cpu_claim_ext eb pj] (iput's complement,
     UNCONDITIONAL: iput may truncate and no caller can know in advance
     which arm runs -- see claude-notes/completed/eb-generic-sweep.md);
   - the whole disk/log/bitmap environment, because iput's last-close arm
     truncates;
   - the budget interval [(n - iput_units) <= n' <= n], spend-at-most,
     because iput never holds log.lock;
   - the panic credentials, which BOTH callees carry -- iunlock's three panic tests
     are dead but SpecIunlock still takes the resource, and iput's
     "sched locks" arm diverges through it (design §13.12, Route B).

   iunlockput itself adds nothing: it has no panic, no lock, no memory
   access outside its own frame.  Its stack need is 4 slots on top of iput's
   ([K_iunlockput = 64 = K_iput + 4]; iunlock's 26 is dominated). *)

(* ---- THE PARK'S OWN ARM, AS A PURE READING (durable-disk B''-tx5) ------

   iput's three windows -- [IcacheEscrow]'s [DepFrz], its mid-free park and
   its authority-side [ic_held] -- each park a SHARE of the freeing
   transaction's [LogDefs.ln_tx] element, which is what lets a commit refute
   them at an empty authority; [SpecIput.wp_iput_gen_body] therefore takes
   one.  iunlockput needs no caller to supply it: it is [iunlock] then
   [iput], and the share the WRITE ARM parked comes home at the first of the
   two ([IcacheEscrow.ic_dep_side]).  That observation is a pure equation on
   the descriptor, so the two generic bodies below can name the [(t, q)]
   without destructing anything -- and since rank 5 it is not this file's:
   [IcacheEscrow.ic_dep_side_tx] IS [ic_dep_side]'s own [TxPin.tx_pin_o]
   index, and [IcacheEscrow.ic_dep_side_of_tx] is its reading.  The two
   contracts below keep the premise at the same spelling. *)

(* iunlockput's own frame is 32 bytes (4 slots: ra@24 s0@16 s1@8, one hole);
   its deepest callee is iput (78).  iunlock wants 26.

   The walk calls iput at [K - 4], so [K_iput <= K - 4] is what fixes this
   number (SpecIput.v's note).  All eleven iunlockput call sites have slack;
   the tightest are ProofCreate / ProofSysUnlinkPure, at [K - 10] / [K - 30]
   of budgets that are themselves well above this. *)

   is for iunlock.  Every published reading below is an instance of one of
   them, so the retirement side of a write lock never leaves a bundleless
   out-state standing across a program step: the descriptor is retired in
   the ghost step that parks the payload
   ([IcacheEscrow.ic_swap_park_dep]).  What the arm parked comes back in the

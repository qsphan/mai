(* SpecFreeproc.v -- the public interface of freeproc() (kernel/proc.c),
   stated independently of its proof.

     static void freeproc(struct proc *p) {
       if (p->trapframe) kfree(p->trapframe);
       p->trapframe = 0;
       if (p->pagetable) proc_freepagetable(p->pagetable, p->sz);
       p->pagetable = 0;
       p->sz = 0;

       p->pid = 0;
       release(&pid_lock);
       p->name[0] = 0;
       p->chan = 0;
       p->killed = 0;
       p->xstate = 0;
       p->state = UNUSED;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.freeproc, thirty-three instructions: a 32-byte ra/s0/s1
   frame (slot 0 unused), the two guarded frees, nine zeroing stores, and
   -- since upstream ded23f2 -- an acquire/release of <pid_lock> around the
   one that clears p->pid.  Both callers already hold p->lock; the pid lock
   is the only lock it takes itself (see PidLock.v for why the cell needs
   it), so the contract's order floor is "nextpid" and it carries the
   lock's handle.  Returns nothing.

   THIS IS THE INVERSE OF allocproc: it turns a slot that owns an address
   space back into a [ProcInv.proc_dormant] at UNUSED, which is exactly the
   shape the lock invariant parks.  Both of its transitions are real moves,
   not recasts: the trapframe page goes to kfree and the user table goes to
   proc_freepagetable, so the postcondition owes the caller nothing but the
   emptied block.

   THE PRECONDITION IS NOT [proc_dormant _ ZOMBIE], AND CANNOT BE.  The two
   address-space cells have to be INDEPENDENTLY optional, because allocproc's
   two failure tails -- the reason this contract is being written now -- reach
   freeproc in states [proc_dormant] cannot name:

     tail at +0x86  kalloc failed: p->trapframe = 0, p->pagetable = 0
     tail at +0x96  proc_pagetable failed: p->trapframe is a LIVE page,
                    p->pagetable = 0

   [proc_dormant]'s address-space disjunct is keyed on [st] and moves BOTH
   cells together (ZOMBIE owns a table and a page; UNUSED owns neither), so
   the second of those is not a [proc_dormant] at any state.  Hence [fp_pt] /
   [fp_tf] below: one option apiece, and the runtime branch this function
   actually takes is the same branch the contract splits on.  The four
   combinations are all stated even though (live table, no trapframe) never
   occurs -- refusing it would cost a premise and buy nothing.

   WHAT THE CALLER MUST STILL PROVE.  [fp_pt]'s [Some] arm carries
   [um_below sz um] and [uint sz <= uvm_maxsz] -- proc_freepagetable's two
   size premises, pulled up one level, and both of them facts a ZOMBIE's
   [ProcInv.proc_dormant] now records.  It carries NO [page_valid]: the
   trapframe page's comes out of [proc_pt_wf] and the root's out of the
   tree's own node claim ([ProcPtOwn.proc_pt_root_valid]), which is what the
   [c.beqz] at +0x1a is refuted from.  [fp_of_dormant_zombie] below is the
   bridge kwait() reclaims a child through; it has no side condition. *)

   [IntrDefs.cpu_hart] -- i.e. with the running kernel thread while interrupts
   are off, and inside [sie_arm true] while they are on -- and a HELD lock's
   invariant keeps the matching [gset_disj] fragment, which is what makes
   "[lk->cpu] is set to hart i" and "a lock of this rank is in i's held set"
   one fact rather than two.

   [gset_disj] rather than a plain [gset]: the fragment must be EXCLUSIVE (so
   release, holding it, can retire the element) and it must be UNFORGEABLE (so
   the tie means something).  What that costs is that minting one needs
   [r ∉ S] -- which is exactly what acquire's order premise
   [LockRank.locks_below S r] supplies, via [locks_below_not_elem].

   RANKS, NOT ADDRESSES, and the element type is where all the ergonomics
   live.  An address set would have to carry a rank alongside each element for
   acquire's premise to be statable at all, and the address half would then
   never be read -- xv6 never holds two locks of the same family, so the order
   is total on every pair it can actually hold (LockRank.v).  Keying on [nat]
   also means the element type takes stdpp's own instances: no [EqDecision] /
   [Countable] pinning is needed (contrast [riscvF_kmapGS] below), and
   [set_solver] WORKS -- over [gset (mword n)] it fails with "No matching

   of ghost state, to be reallocated fresh at each power-on so that a new
   boot's memory/register resources are independent of the previous

   fixed class below needs its [ghost_varG]: both sit under every FS file.
   It carries no FS CONSTANT; it is one total block view -- the era's
   picture of every durable block's contents, homes included.  The crash
   layer's custody arm ([FsCrash.fs_custody]) pins it to the physical disk
   pointwise ([FsCrash.log_mirror_ok]), which is what lets a WAL write's
   ∅-mask permit know the committed state BY VALUE: the WAL's own writes
   are the only writes to the durable extent, so every permit re-establishes
   the picture at the post-write image.  Derived readings (the header's

     mints the PERSISTENT certificate [IntrDefs.kpt_on].  The three faces
     are [strans_pending_at] / [strans_kpt_at] / [kpt_on_at] below; the

     there is only one in a [riscvFixedGS] context, which is exactly why
     those three are definitions).  Monotone, hence safely persistent WITHIN
     an era: kexec starts a new era with a fresh name.
     PER-HART, like [cpu_reg_name]: satp and tlb are per-hart registers, so
     which arm a hart's translation slot is in is a per-hart fact, and the
     shared-kernel-table sweep (claude-notes/completed/kpt-share.md) needs
     every hart to shoot its own at its own kvminithart. *)
  era_strans_name : CPU -> gname;
  (* the SIE ghost, CANONICALLY per hart -- the same shape as [strans_name],
     and for the same reason: mstatus.SIE is a per-hart register, so which
     value a hart's SIE choreography (1/2 live-bit tie + 1/4 kernel-code token
     + 1/4 invariant, IntrDefs.v §2) is at is a per-hart fact.

     Making the name CANONICAL rather than an explicit parameter is what lets
     the whole sconf tier -- [sconf] / [sie_cap] / [sie_cap_gpr] / [sie_arm] /
     [intr_count] / [intr_off_tok] / [intr_inv] / [intr_handler_avail] -- drop
     its [γ] argument entirely: the hart determines the ghost.  In particular a
     step's continuation then quantifies only the HART (WpNext.v), and every
     parking contract's [∀ h g] collapses to [∀ h].

     NOT canonical, and deliberately so: the per-trap ghost [ProofKernelvec.v]
     mints for the handler's own SIE tie.  During a trap the live bit is 0
     while the interrupted thread's half still reads 1, so those two cannot
     share a name; [wp_kernelvec] takes a raw [ghost_var_frac γ (1/2) _] and stays
     parameterized.  The functor instance comes from [sieG] at the use sites,
     for the same reason spelled out for [strans_name] above. *)
  era_sie_name : CPU -> gname;
  (* mstatus.SPP's ghost MIRROR, canonically per hart -- the same shape as
     [sie_name], and needed for a reason the other trap-scribbled state does
     not have.  A trap writes sepc / scause / stval AND mstatus.SPP; the
     first three are whole registers, so ownership of them moves by moving
     the cell (they sit in [IntrDefs.trap_csrs], inside [sie_arm true] while
     interrupts are enabled and in the code's hands while they are off).
     SPP is a BIT INSIDE mstatus, and mstatus cannot leave [sconf] -- SIE
     lives there too, and so do the well-formedness facts -- so its
     ownership has to move as a ghost instead.

     Hence TWO halves, exactly as SIE has: one TIED inside [sconf] to
     [_get_Mstatus_SPP ms], and one that travels with [trap_csrs], held at
     an EXISTENTIAL value by the enabled arm (a trap can rewrite SPP between
     any two instructions) and at a PINNED value by interrupts-off code.
     That is what lets a trap handler entered from S-mode still know, four
     instructions later, that SPP = 1 -- the fact the funnel's [exists ms]
     would otherwise destroy.

     The [ghost_varG Σ (mword 1)] functor instance comes from [sieG] at the
     use sites, NOT from a field here, for the same reason spelled out for
     [strans_name]: a second instance of that class would make resolution
     ambiguous.  SPP is one bit, so [sieG]'s instance already fits. *)
  era_spp_name : CPU -> gname;
  (* mstatus.SPIE's mirror, the twin of [spp_name] and travelling with it.
     SPIE is the OTHER bit an [sret] reads (it restores SIE from it), it is
     written by the same trap, and it is preserved by the same SIE flips --
     so it obeys the identical discipline and the two are always held
     together, as [IntrDefs.sret_bits].  Two names rather than one ghost over
     a pair only because [sieG]'s [ghost_varG (mword 1)] then serves both
     with no new class. *)
  era_spie_name : CPU -> gname;
  (* THE HART TAG, CANONICALLY per proc slot.  One [ghost_var_frac CPU] per entry
     of the proc[] array, naming the hart that a RUNNING proc is running on.
     Two halves: while the proc is RUNNING one sits in its [p->lock]'s
     running arm ([SchedCtx.run_slot]) and the other rides the running
     thread's [IntrDefs.cpu_claim]; otherwise both sit whole in the lock
     ([SchedCtx.proc_slots]) and the value is meaningless.

     KEYED BY THE PROC, NOT BY THE HART: that is what makes the entitlement
     HART-FREE, so a thread carries it across a migration as a plain frame
     (a per-hart receipt would be exactly the kind of stranded resource the
     explicit-cpuid refactor exists to remove).

     CANONICAL rather than an explicit [γk : list gname] parameter, for
     precisely the reason spelled out for [sie_name] and [kmap_name] above:
     the receipt is named inside [SchedCtx.proc_lock_res], hence inside
     [procs_inv], and a parameter there would have to be threaded through
     every one of the ~50 files that mention [procs_inv].  The function is
     total; only indices below [NPROC] are ever owned. *)
  era_park_name : nat -> gname;
  (* THE PER-PROC STATE MIRROR (design/proc-struct.md, the state ghost).
     Two halves of a [ghost_var_frac] carrying [p->state]'s value: the proc lock
     invariant owns one, tied to the cell, and the other is lock-resident
     except at the two states where a THREAD has claimed the proc (RUNNING,
     USED).  Since a ghost_var_frac cannot move on half alone and the cell cannot
     move without the ghost, the right to WRITE [p->state] is exactly
     ownership of the second half.

     Canonical for the same reason as [era_park_name] directly above: it is
     named inside [SchedCtx.proc_lock_res], hence inside [procs_inv]. *)
  era_pstate_name : nat -> gname;
  (* THE DISK IMAGE MAP (claude-notes/design/crash.md, design/fs-log.md
     stage 4): a byte-granularity ghost map mirroring [v_disk], tied to the
     state by [disk_dur_interp] below -- ONE conjunct of this era's
     [era_interp], hence gone when the era is.

     PER-ERA, deliberately.  The image itself survives a power cycle (it is
     the one machine component that does), but its GHOST mirror must not:
     client-visible fragments -- bio's pool/escrow, the log's block views --
     park in era invariants, and a FIXED map could never re-mint them at the
     next boot ([ghost_map] cannot re-create an existing key, and auth-side
     forgetting needs the element, which is exactly what is stranded), so a
     fixed map cannot boot twice once the FS layer holds fragments.  A fresh
     map per era, allocated at the PRESERVED content and handed out WHOLE
     ([RiscvAdequacy.power_boot_res]'s boot mint), has no such problem: the
     dead era's fragments are abandoned with everything else it owned.

     The class typing it stays FIXED-layer ([riscvF_diskGS], from DiskImg.v):
     it is the unique source of the [ghost_mapG Σ Z (bv 8)] instance in a
     [riscvGS] context, and a second one could not interact with it. *)
  era_disk_name : gname;
  (* THE FS LOG-REGION MIRROR (claude-notes/design/fs-log.md stage 4 phase
     C2b/D1): this era's [ghost_var_frac] over the physical log region's picture,
     split 1/2 - 1/2 between the log layer ([LogInv]'s batch/lock resource)
     and [P_fs]'s CHECKED-OUT arm.  It is what carries the WAL's physical
     phase ACROSS bwrite calls -- "the on-disk header is clean", "the log
     slots hold the logged values", "the header is the (n, W) I just wrote"
     -- none of which any single call site can re-derive at its own call.

     PER-ERA for exactly the reason [era_disk_name] is: the log layer's half
     dies with the era, and a FIXED gname's stranded half could never be
     re-paired at the next boot.  Identification of the arm's gname with the
     AMBIENT era's is by the swap counter ([riscv_swap_name] below), squeezed
     against the started-generations auth the DMA completion threads in. *)
  era_mirror_name : gname;
  (* THE HELD-LOCK SET, CANONICALLY per hart (design/kernel-proofs.md): the
     authority of [LockSet.cpu_locks], naming the spinlocks this hart holds.

     PER-HART, like [sie_name] and [strans_name]: which locks are held is a
     property of the HART (xv6 records it in [lk->cpu], a [struct cpu]
     pointer), not of the thread -- and a lock is taken and given back with
     interrupts off, so it never crosses a migration.

     CANONICAL rather than a parameter, for the reason spelled out at
     [era_sie_name]: the authority lives inside [IntrDefs.cpu_hart], hence
     inside [cpu_own] / [sie_arm] / every whole-function contract in the
     sconf tier, and an explicit [γ] there would have to be threaded through
     all ~312 files that name [cpu_own].  The [inG Σ lockSetR] instance is
     [riscvF_lockSetGS] below, not a separate class, for the same reason. *)

     the [era_reg_name]-style function of names, because the auth is a single
     map and every rule that touches it touches exactly one key.

     Why the logic needs it: at its conditional write an RMW hart opens its
     invariant, sees [x |-> v'], and must know [v'] is the value it READ -- an
     acquire cannot take [R] without knowing the write is 0->1.  Physically
     true (every competing writer was blocked) but no invariant carries it

(* WHY A MASK-[∅] FUPD AND NOT A BASIC UPDATE.  A client whose crash
   predicate is TIMELESS -- [FsCrash.P_fs_any] is, every conjunct of it is a
   [ghost_map]/[mono_nat]/[own] over a discrete cmra -- has to STRIP the [▷]
   this type hands it before it can update the record's ghosts, and a basic
   update cannot do that: [◇] is not absorbed by [|==>] (there is no
   [▷ |==> P ⊢ |==> ▷ P] in Iris either).  A fupd at ANY mask absorbs [◇], so
   [∅] is the right choice: it is the weakest thing to PROVE (no invariant is
   open inside it -- a crash permit never opens one, it is handed the
   predicate directly), and the consumer runs it under whatever mask it holds
   via [fupd_mask_subseteq].  Nothing else about the seam changes. *)

(* WHY THE PERMIT NAMES ITS AUTHOR'S GENERATION [gd] (phase C2b/D1).  A crash
   permit is a STATELESS view shift: it runs at the DMA completion with only
   what its author curried at enqueue.  But the facts a WAL write's fupd needs
   about the PHYSICAL log region are chain facts -- established by the
   PREVIOUS writes -- so they have to be read out of a mirror the ERA holds a
   half of, and the crash predicate's own half of that mirror sits under an
   EXISTENTIAL (the mirror gname is per-era, because a fixed one could never
   be re-paired after a crash).  Matching the two halves therefore needs the
   fupd to know that the recorded custodian IS the ambient era.

   THE AUTHOR'S OWN GENERATION IS THE ONLY WORKABLE INDEX, and an earlier
   draft that quantified over the CONSUMER's generation instead
   ([∀ g E, era_registered g E -∗ …]) is UNPROVABLE at every real call site:
   everything a client can curry is at ITS [gen_id] -- [swap_lb (S gen_id)]
   and the mirror half at [era_mirror_name riscv_eraGS] -- while the squeeze
   would need both at the supplied [g].  The gap is exactly [g = gen_id], and
   it has no source: the registry is a plain [ghost_map nat riscvEraGS] with
   no injectivity (the base rules never need any -- [RiscvExec] identifies
   [E = riscv_eraGS] only in the [ggen = gen_id] case and parks a stale thread
   with [wp_dead]), and a [mono_nat] lower bound cannot be raised.  Nor MAY it
   be derivable: a stale era's permit must fail, or the crash predicate is
   unsound.

   So the freshness certificate comes from the completion, against the
   author's own [gd]: the completion threads in [state_interp]'s
   started-generations auth with the live-era arithmetic [n = gd + 1] and
   takes it back.  The client instantiates
   [FsCrash.fs_arm_acc] at [(gen_id, riscv_eraGS)] and the squeeze closes:
   its own [swap_lb (S gen_id)] gives [S gen_id <= c] from below, the arm's
   [gen_started g''] against that auth gives [g'' <= gen_id] from above, so
   [c = S gen_id] and [g'' = gen_id] -- and [era_registered] agreement AT THE
   SHARED KEY then gives [E'' = riscv_eraGS].

   WHAT MAKES THE CONSUMPTION SIDE WORK is era-locality, not per-request data:
   [PermInv.perm_inv] is indexed by the SAME [gd], so every permit in an era's
   channel is at that era's generation by construction, and [wp_disk_loop]
   holds the channel at its own [gen_id].  A dead era's channel is simply
   never opened again -- its device loop corpse-steps -- so its permits die
   unconsumed, which is exactly the soundness story.

   The IDENTITY permit ignores both remaining arguments, so a read's permit is
   still free at an ARBITRARY crash predicate. *)

(* THE IDENTITY PERMIT, and why it is still free.  A request that moves no
   disk byte carries [w = None], and [wr_apply None] is the identity ON THE
   NOSE, so the two occurrences of the crash predicate are syntactically the
   same and the permit is provable for an ARBITRARY client predicate.  Every
   READ deposits this, which is what keeps the whole read stack (bread and
   everything above it) textually unchanged by the C2a reshape. *)

(* THE SEQUENTIAL PERMIT (claude-notes/completed/sector-atomic-disk.md §6e).
   A 512-byte SECTOR lands atomically and a 1024-byte BLOCK does not, so ONE
   request has one linearization point PER SECTOR.  The request's obligation
   is therefore not a bag of independent permits -- it is ONE object that
   unfolds a step at a time: a conjunction over the sectors STILL TO LAND,
   each branch a permit whose receipt is the RESIDUAL obligation for the
   rest, and whose leaf (nothing left) is the completion's identity permit
   delivering the client's [Q].

   WHY A CONJUNCTION AND NOT A SEPARATING ONE.  The device picks the landing
   order, so the client must be ready for every branch -- but exactly ONE is
   ever taken, so all of them may be proved from the SAME resources.  That is
   [∧], and it is the whole reason this shape exists: an earlier design
   handed out one INDEPENDENT permit per sector, and then the client's
   mirror half (an exclusive [ghost_var_frac] fragment) could be curried into only
   one of them, with no way for the other to obtain it -- a permit is a
   stateless view shift with no input slot and no invariant it may open at
   mask [∅].  Here whatever a later sector needs travels DOWN THE CHAIN
   inside the residual.

   Spelled with an explicit fuel so the recursion is structural; the fuel is
   always [size todo], which is what [sperm] fixes and what makes

(* memory points-to, VA-BASED (uniform-claims): owns the byte at the
   PHYSICAL address the kernel mapping takes [va] to, bundled with the
   claim itself.  The KP_rw class is what
   makes stores provable ONLY through writable mappings; the R|X kernel
   text lives at the CODE points-to [↦ₓ] below.  The canonicality
   conjunct (positive Sv39 half) pins va ↔ (vpn, offset).  [dq] is a
   [dfrac]: [DfracOwn 1] = full (writable) ownership, [DfracDiscarded] =
   persistent/duplicable read-only ownership (the immutable kernel
   globals image [kernel_data]).

   THE TIER PIN CONJUNCT [ktier_pin kt ppn va] (claude-notes/projects/
   sp-migration.md).  A KT0 datum's va IS its physical address, and that is
   what makes a [↦ₘ] access sound under BOTH translation regimes -- a hart
   in Bare mode translates va to va itself, so a non-identity KT0 [↦ₘ]
   would be accessed at the WRONG page there, and no ghost resource can
   rule that out per-hart (a secondary hart is legitimately Bare long after
   the kernel map has grown).  So the identity is a conjunct of the
   RESOURCE rather than a premise on every leaf: the Bare regime's
   [sr_adm] admissibility premise (SRegime.v) is discharged from the datum
   itself, and no leaf statement or whole-function contract mentions it.
   A KT1 datum drops the pin entirely -- a kernel-stack byte at [KSTACK(i)]
   or a TRAMPOLINE byte IS expressible -- and pays for it with the per-hart
   [sr_kwit] witness at the leaf (phase D).

   THE TIER IS AN AMBIENT INSTANCE ARGUMENT, not a positional one: the
   spellings below leave [KTR] to typeclass resolution, so a file selects
   its tier once with a [Local Instance : CurKtier := ...] (the global
   default is KT0) and its spec text is unchanged.  Explicit-tier

(* CODE points-to, VA-BASED (uniform-claims): the KP_rx analogue -- the
   claim + ownership of the mapped physical byte; identity for the static
   kernel-text fragments, non-identity for the TRAMPOLINE va once its
   fragment is minted at the boot switch.  [↦ₓ□] is the form the immutable
   kernel image lives at ([kernel_text]/[instr_bytes]).

   THE TIER PIN CONJUNCT, exactly as for [mem_pointsto] above and for the
   same reason (claude-notes/projects/sp-migration.md, K5): a KT0 code byte
   promises that its va IS its physical address, which is what makes a
   FETCH at it sound under BOTH translation regimes -- a Bare hart fetches
   physical [va].  Every byte of the static kernel-text image is KT0 and
   nothing about it changes.  A KT1 code byte drops the pin and is
   therefore expressible at the TRAMPOLINE va (whose page is the SAME
   kernel-text page, mapped high); driving a fetch with it needs the
   per-hart witness [SRegime.sr_kwit] instead, which is what
   [SRegime.sr_absorb_ktier] dispatches on.

   THE TIER IS AN AMBIENT INSTANCE ARGUMENT (phase C's convention): the
   three spellings below leave [KTR] to typeclass resolution -- the global
   default is KT0, so every existing text fact means exactly what it meant
   -- and an explicit tier is written [a ↦ₓ[kt]{dq} v]. *)
(* THE TIMESTAMP CONJUNCT (tso-machine-flip.md's rewritten RULING 1, and
   A6.10's pristine tier).  Post-overruling an instruction FETCH takes the
   same nondeterministic-view arm as a plain data load, so a fetch site owes
   a view-indexed [tso_read_bytes] fact and a bare points-to cannot pay it.
   What pays it for kernel TEXT is that a text byte's latest write IS the era
   image -- timestamp 0, visible at every agent and every view -- and the
   RESOURCE that says so is the DISCARDED timestamp element.  It is carried
   HERE, inside [text_pointsto], rather than threaded as a premise, and that
   is the whole reason nothing above the fetch leaves moves: [kernel_text] is
   a big-op of [↦ₓ□], [KernelText.kernel_window_pc] cuts a window out of it,
   [InstrBytes.instr_bytes] holds the window, and all ~135 leaf sites are
   textually unchanged.  DISCARDED is also exactly the right strength: it
   says the byte can never be STORED to again (a store must UPDATE the
   element), which is what "read-only forever" and "readable from anywhere"
   both mean here -- one resource for both, and W^X for the text region as a
   consequence rather than as an assumption.  THE ONE NEW OBLIGATION is at
   the single place [↦ₓ] is born from raw memory ([KMap.phys_ident_text],
   through [BootCarve.boot_text_persist]); the era's initial-state ghost
   allocation is its supplier, the same one A6.10/A6.34 already name. *)

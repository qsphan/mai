   GENERALIZED INTO A FRESH VARIABLE rather than resolved, and a file whose
   [ctokG] comes off [Xv6G]'s field would then hold two of them -- one in
   the class's index and one in every [my_pay] it writes -- which print
   identically and do not match.  Named and non-generalizable, the index is
   filled by instance resolution at every binding site.  The

     through the whole kernel excursion, so a payload chosen by the fork
     deposit and read back by the fork arm must travel with something the

     exec's deposit is a [PieceFam.pfam], and a [pfam] is an AU BESIDE ITS
     REFUND: [PieceFam.pf_at_refund] says a piece that never fired hands
     back what was put into it.  An exec that FAILS is exactly such a
     piece -- and with the -1 payload no longer riding [UkRun.urun]'s row
     (that row is a wand from the kill credential now), the resource a
     process spent into the exec deposit is the ONLY thing it has left to
     pay its own [exit(1)] with when the exec comes back.  So the refund
     is the process's, not the kernel's frame: the earlier design's "a
     program cannot retry exec" is withdrawn.

     WHERE IT TRAVELS: the arm's post, at exec, which was [emp] and is now
     a wand from "the answer was -1".  Nothing between the dispatcher and
     the ecall leaf had to move -- [spost_at] is already relayed at every
     number ([SpecSyscall.sysc_sys_out], [UexecRet.uexec_ret_cont_gen]) --
     which is why the refund reaches the leaf without a new row anywhere.
     [sexec_refund] NAMES it, because [spost_at]'s type cannot: a caller

     A DESCRIPTOR ROW'S REGISTRATION -- what a run carries per table row

     kexit closes every descriptor the dying process holds, so exit(2)'s
     bundle row is [SpecFileclose.fileclose_cpays] of the KEY'S WHOLE
     TABLE: a [∗ list] of independent payments, [emp] at every row but a
     pipe end and [PipeQueue.pipe_cpay] there.  The fact that decides it

     WHY IT IS A FIELD OF THIS CLASS AND NOT A DEFINITION IN [UkRun]
     (this lane's finding).  The row IS [PipeReg.pipe_row_reg], which
     names the pipe's queue camera -- and [UkRun] binds no pipe ghost
     class, by design ("this file binds no whole-system bundle").  Giving
     it one adds an implicit [pipeG] argument to [urun] itself and hence
     a [Context] line to each of the seventy-odd U-tier files that state
     a run.  Every one of those files already binds THIS class, so
     routing the row through it costs no site anything: [urun_nopipe] is
     stated at [srow_reg] and the one instance ([UexecExecInst.
     uexecSG_xv6]) answers it with [PipeReg.pipe_row_reg].

     THE TWO LAWS ARE WHAT THE ENGINE'S STEPS RUN ON, and nothing else is
     assumed of the row: it is persistent (so a dup'd row, a forked
     child's copy of the table and two rows on one pipe all cost
     nothing), and a row that is not a pipe registers itself (so a
     program that never calls pipe(2) pays nothing whatever).  The
     pipe-specific intros -- the taint's and lane PIPE-PROTO's invariant
     handle -- are NOT laws here: they name pipe ghosts, so they live at

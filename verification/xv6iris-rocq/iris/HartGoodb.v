(* HartGoodb.v -- the bridge from the DECODE CATALOGUE's certificate to the
   [swp] layer's footprinted characterization.

   THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES.  [HartMRun.swp_run_hart_active_base]/[_rvc] want
   the decode as a footprinted fact ([hval], or [hfrun] at some fuel); the
   [instr] bundle -- and the 3752 generated [kd_] lemmas under it -- supply
   it as [exec (decode_fetch r) σ = Some (i, σ)].  A general [exec] ->
   footprint bridge looks circular: to know a footprinted walker will not
   REFUSE, you need "reads only [D], touches no memory", which is exactly
   what the footprinted walker exists to decide.

   THE HYPOTHESIS IS ALREADY IN THE TREE.  [WpDecodeBridge.goodb Db m s] is
   a COMPUTABLE certificate of precisely that: [Ret] passes, a [RegRead r]
   passes iff [Db r], the silent classes pass, and EVERYTHING ELSE -- memory,
   [Choose], failures, and REGISTER WRITES -- is [false].  Every generated
   decode proof already establishes it by [vm_compute], because
   [decode_state_bridge] consumes it.

   So [goodb] and [hfrun] are the same structural walk, and this file is the
   induction that says so.  Two consequences fall out of [goodb] rejecting
   writes: the walk cannot change the register file, so the post-file is the
   pre-file; and [exec] is guaranteed to succeed, so no [exec] hypothesis is
   needed -- the value is produced, not assumed. *)

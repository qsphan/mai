(* HartEvents.v -- the per-memory-event WP rules, item 2 of the proof
   interface (claude-notes/design/main-cycle-port.md §5): one rule per event
   class -- RAM read (plain and EXCLUSIVE), RAM write, MMIO read, MMIO
   write.  (The pinned-text fetch rule is a later derived specialization of
   [wp_hart_ram_read].)

   THE RESERVATION (design §3a) shows up in exactly two ways here, and both
   are INSIDE the proofs, not in the statements: a RAM write or an exclusive
   read whose footprint meets another hart's reservation SELF-LOOPS, and the
   rule absorbs that arm by Löb (the caller's premise is untouched on that
   arm, so the IH applies verbatim); and the caller learns nothing about the
   hart's own reservation from these rules -- [wp_hart_step] ∀-quantifies
   it -- which is right until the conditional-write rule that will need the
   [resv_frag].  The exclusive-read rule below therefore has the SAME
   statement as the plain one; what differs is only which language arm it
   takes.

   THE CURRENCY IS TODAY'S: each rule hands the caller a fupd σ-callback
   with [mstate_interp], exactly as [wp_exec_step] did, so the points-to /
   invariant reasoning happens with the same bridges the existing leaves use
   ([mem_valid], [text_valid], [phys_valid], the gen_heap update lemmas).
   What each rule internalizes is the per-node successor INVERSION: the
   caller's witness pins the machine's one successor, so the continuation is
   stated at the resumed cursor ([hread_resume]/[hwrite_resume]) and never
   at a ∀-quantified next state.

   Each rule takes its node's PROJECTION fact ([hread_req_at]/[hwrite_req_at]
   = Some req) rather than a syntactic [Interface.Next ... K] hypothesis --
   the finding-F8 discipline: no call site ever writes a continuation down. *)

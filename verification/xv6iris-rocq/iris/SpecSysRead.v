   sys_write is this function INSTRUCTION FOR INSTRUCTION (same frame, same
   offsets, same registers); only the three [jal] targets differ, and the
   third is filewrite.  See SpecSysWrite.v.

   THE COUNT IS SIGN-EXTENDED, and that is the whole numeric story: argint
   narrows argraw's [uint64] to the [int] cell ([SpecArgint], a [c.sw], i.e.
   [trunc32]) and the [lw] at +0x30 reads it back SIGNED, so what reaches
   fileread's a2 is [sign_extend' 64 (trunc32 v)] -- which
   [RiscvExtras.sext32_64_moi] says is [mword_of_int (bv_signed (trunc32 v))]
   exactly.  [sys_rw_count] below is that value.

   ==== THE TWO NUMERIC PREMISES, AND WHY THEY ARE STILL HERE ============

   READ THIS BEFORE ADDING A CALLER.  [SpecFileread] takes

       0 <= n         and        MAXFILE*BSIZE + n < 2^31

   and sys_read passes [n] STRAIGHT FROM USER INPUT: the C checks nothing
   between argint and the call, and the object code confirms it (the only
   branch in the function is argfd's).  So neither premise can be discharged
   here, and both appear below as premises of THIS contract, about the
   trapframe word the user wrote.

   That is not new debt and it is not this stage's invention -- it is
   claude-notes/design/file-table.md's, recorded there verbatim: "sys_read
   cannot discharge it from unchecked user input, and that is known debt, to
   be settled at sys_read, not inside fileread", with two options, (a) prove
   readi's own overflow arm (which needs a wrapping-[addw] reading the tree
   does not have) or (b) bound [n] at the syscall boundary.  What this file
   adds is the precise statement of what is owed, and the observation that
   the two premises are NOT the same kind of thing:

   * [MAXFILE*BSIZE + n < 2^31] is readi's joint bound, inherited through
     fileread, and it is option (a)'s: xv6's own [off + n < off] test in
     readi is the real kernel's answer and the model kills it by premise.
     sys_write does NOT carry it -- filewrite's chunking closes writei's
     joint bound internally (fs-sysfile S3f) -- so this premise is the one
     genuine asymmetry between the two syscalls.
   * [0 <= n] is carried by BOTH sys_read and sys_write, because
     [SpecFilewrite] takes [0 <= n < 2^31] as well.  A negative [n] is
     perfectly well handled by the C (the loop body never runs and the tail
     answers -1), so this half is a modelling premise, not a kernel fact,
     and it is the cheaper of the two to retire.

   THE UPPER HALF IS FREE: [sys_rw_count] is [bv_signed] of a 32-bit word, so
   [< 2^31] holds unconditionally ([sys_rw_count_lt] below).  Only the lower
   bound and the MAXFILE offset have to be assumed.

   ==== THE REST OF THE SHAPE ============================================

   [pfd] is NULL (sys_read wants the [struct file *] and not the descriptor
   index), which is exactly the case [SpecArgfd.ofd_out] exists for; and the
   error return is hoisted above the branch so that both arms reach one
   epilogue with the answer already in a0.

   ==== THE ENVIRONMENT IS OWNED, NOT OPENED (fs-sysfile S4c) ============

   S4 froze this contract with an OPENER -- a wand turning the reference the
   descriptor turned out to hold into fileread's environment for THAT file --
   because [fileread_env] was indexed by the file's CONTENT and by its fd
   SLOT, neither of which a syscall can name ([ProcInv.ofile_slot] quantifies
   the slot, the fraction and the content existentially).  S4' overturned it,
   and the reason is stronger than taste: the opener promised back a
   [file_ref gf k q'] at a SMALLER fraction, and NO SUCH THING EXISTS --
   [FileInvDefs.fref_tok]'s reference COUNT rides in the same map entry as the
   fraction, so two fragments at [q/2] compose to [(q, 2)] and not to
   [(q, 1)].  Splitting a [file_ref] at all needs the ftable AUTHORITY, i.e.
   filedup's ghost step, which is unsound without the physical [f->ref++].
   The opener was satisfiable only at [q' = q], with the whole environment
   already in the caller's hands: it deferred the problem rather than solving
   it.  SpecSysFstat.v's header has the full account.

   What this contract takes instead is [fileread_fs_env], which names neither
   the content nor the slot: the escrow FAMILY, the sleeplock FAMILY, the
   off-borrow FAMILY, the inode region, the block cache, the disk fabric and
   the region-wide inum geometry.  The per-inode pieces the old
   environment asked its caller for -- the itable slot, the inum, the device,
   the region bound and the SHARE -- were inside the reference all along
   ([FileInvDefs.inode_pay]); fileread carves them out itself
   ([SpecFileread.fileread_pay_carve]) and gathers them back, so the syscall
   owes nothing per-file at all.

   ==== AND THE DEVICE TABLE'S READ COLUMN ================================

   The FD_DEVICE arm's [devsw[major].read] cell is the one thing that could
   NOT be made content-independent by restating it, because its ADDRESS is a
   function of [dev_major Cf]: one cell covers one major.  The honest answer is
   that a syscall which may be handed any descriptor owns the whole column --
   ten cells, [fileread_devsw] -- and [fileread_devsw_acc] picks the entry
   the file turns out to name and takes it straight back (the arm only READS
   it).  That is not a hidden weakening: reading a device descriptor really
   does require owning that table entry, and nothing smaller is ownable
   before the descriptor is resolved. *)

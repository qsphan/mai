(* SpecWalkaddr.v -- the public interface of Walkaddr, stated independently
   of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never a
   whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

     uint64 walkaddr(pagetable_t pagetable, uint64 va) {
       if (va >= MAXVA) return 0;
       pte_t *pte = walk(pagetable, va, 0);
       if (pte == 0) return 0;
       if (( *pte & PTE_V) == 0) return 0;
       if (( *pte & PTE_U) == 0) return 0;
       return PTE2PA( *pte);
     }

   (the compiler merges the two flag tests into one [andi a3,a5,17] against
   [li a4,17], so the machine really decides [pte_vu]).

   Like [ismapped], stated over the EXACT represented map [pt_rep0 t m] --
   the xv6 zero-stop-word shape -- with the tree riding through READ-ONLY at
   a generic dfrac.  The only callee is the no-alloc walk, so there is no
   kalloc environment and no [cpu_own].

   THE FAILURE ARM CARRIES ITS REASON, and it has to.  [va >= MAXVA], "the
   walk did not reach a slot", "the slot is zero" and "the slot is not a
   valid USER leaf" collapse to the same answer 0, and for a long time no
   caller cared: copyin / copyout / copyinstr all react to 0 the same way,
   by faulting the page in or giving up, so the arm was stated as a bare
   [a0 = 0] and the header recorded the case split as buying nothing.

   IT BUYS EXACTLY ONE THING, and it turns out to be load-bearing: a caller
   that KNOWS the leaf is there and is a user leaf can REFUTE the arm.
   Without the reason it cannot -- a bare [a0 = 0] is permitted
   unconditionally, so no amount of knowledge about the map rules the
   branch out, and the fault path stays alive in the proof even where it is
   dead in the machine.

   (This used to be what generalised copyout needed: on a table that was not
   the running process's there were no [p->sz] / [p->pagetable] cells to
   give vmfault, so the call had to be shown UNREACHABLE and this
   disjunction was what showed it.  xv6 `4f2fc8b` retired that need --
   vmfault takes the size as an argument now -- so copyout no longer refutes
   the arm; see SpecCopyout.v.  The disjunction stays because it is the
   honest statement of walkaddr, and other callers still refute with it.)

   The three reasons are exactly the three tests the machine performs, in
   order, and each is a fact the caller can contradict on its own terms.
   Note the third is [~ pte_vu w], not [~ pte_valid w]: the compiler merged
   the V and U tests into one [andi a3,a5,17], so a leaf that is present and
   valid but has U CLEARED fails here -- which is not a hypothetical, it is
   precisely a [uvmclear]'d guard page ([ProcPtOwn.proc_pt_wf_clear_u] keeps
   such an entry in [ud_um]).  A caller whose premise is only "the map has an
   entry" has not ruled this out.

   THE SUCCESS ARM is what makes the answer usable: the returned address is
   the base of the page the map's leaf at this vpn names, that leaf passes
   the V&U test ([pte_vu] -- so, for a process table, its vpn is in the user
   MAP, not the trampoline or the trapframe), and [va] was below MAXVA (so
   the caller may go on to [walk] the same va, as copyout does). *)

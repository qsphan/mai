(* PipeDisc.v -- THE PIPELINE APPLICATION'S PURE MODEL: the lines the user
   may type ([echo w1 .. wn] and [echo w1 .. wn | cat]), the alternative
   each round may take, and the console transcript the session calls for.
   Iris-free, over [EchoDisc]/[LineWords], so the claim can be read -- and
   refuted -- without opening the logic.

   Design of record: claude-notes/design/app-pipe.md section 1.  Worklist
   claude-notes/projects/app-pipe.md, lane PIPE-MODEL.

   WHAT THIS FILE IS.  [EchoDisc] models a session in which every round is
   one echo line.  Here a round is one of TWO line shapes, and the pipeline
   shape's round is run by THREE processes (the shell's runcmd child, echo
   at the pipe's write end and cat at its read end), so its console
   continuation has alternatives the echo line has not: the two exec
   diagnostics, EVERY BYTE-WISE INTERLEAVING of the two when both execs
   fail, and sh's own [pipe]/[fork] panics in the runcmd child.  Nothing
   survives the round -- a pipe dies with its era -- so the session
   function threads NO state and is [EchoDisc.sess] with a richer
   alternative type ([sessp]), read through an injective [nat] encoding so
   that the stage's [cs_auth]/[cs_lb] machinery is reused verbatim.
   Upstream's [FileDisc] is the shape this file copies, file section for
   file section; it is NOT imported (the two models share no statement).

   THE OBSERVER STILL CANNOT SEE WHICH ALTERNATIVE RAN, and does not need
   to: at [echo fork | cat] the good run prints "fork\n$ ", which is also
   what sh's [fork1] panic in the runcmd child prints.  So the determinacy
   theorem [sessp_prefix_det] -- the twin of [EchoOutPure.sess_prefix_det],
   which is what the stage spends -- concludes an equality of BYTES and
   never of indices.  Its engine is one observation, not a table: every
   alternative's own output is a '$'-free run followed by the prompt,
   except [PEcho 3] -- the MAIN loop's [fork1] panic, admitted at BOTH
   line shapes -- which kills the shell and re-enters init's prologue.

   WHERE THIS FILE DEPARTS FROM design section 1, each departure reported
   in claude-notes/projects/app-pipe.md under Findings.  The first two were
   RULED by the coordinator on 2026-09-18 and the ruling is what is landed;
   the rest are the lane's and stand.

   - [palt_ok] now admits [PEcho 3] -- and only [PEcho 3] among the
     [PEcho]s -- at an [LPipe] line.  Design section 1's table said
     "LEcho lines only" while its prose said "[LPipe] lines reach
     [alt_panic] exactly as [LEcho] lines do"; the lane reported that the
     table makes the theorem FALSE (the machine's MAIN-loop [fork1] can
     fail on a pipeline round, putting [alt_panic] and a FRESH PROLOGUE on
     the wire, which no other [LPipe] alternative prints) and the
     coordinator ruled for the prose.  See [palt_ok_pipe_panic],
     [palt_panic_3], and the transcript [demo_p_panic].
   - [palt_code] is POSITIONAL/BINARY, not [encode_nat]'s pairing:
     [PBoth sel] is [11 + 16 * bnum sel] where [bnum] reads [sel] as a
     binary numeral with a leading 1 (so leading [false]s survive), and
     [palt_of] divides.  The lane reported that [encode_nat] grows ~4x per
     entry, so a code at [|sel| = 33] was ~[4^33]; the binary reading is
     ~[2^34].  BUT [nat] IS UNARY, so even [2^34] is not computable --
     section 8 records the measured curve and says why the two [PBoth]
     demos are still proved by rewriting with [palt_of_code] rather than
     by [vm_compute].
   - [parse_pline] inverts [line_body] (the body [LineWords.bodies_of]
     cuts), NOT [line_bytes] (which carries the closing newline the cut
     has already stripped).  The brief's
     [parse_pline (line_body (line_bytes l)) = Some l] is not even
     well-typed; the law that holds is [parse_pline_body] below, and
     [line_bytes l = line_body l ++ [wl_nl]] is kept as its own equation.
     This is [FileDisc]'s first departure, verbatim.
   - [pcont_shape] gives only "a '$'-free run, then the prompt", and
     [pcont_shape_nl] gives [FileDisc.cont_shape]'s stronger reading as a
     DISJUNCTION: the run's only newline is its last byte, OR the run opens
     on 'e'.  The newline half is FALSE at [PBoth sel]
     ([pcont_both_no_nl_shape] below): a merge of the two diagnostics
     carries TWO newlines.  The second arm replaces it, and it is all the
     determinacy proof wants, because the only comparison that spends the
     lemma puts sh's panic line -- which opens on 'f' -- on the other side
     ([pd_head_ne_panic]).
   - [pmerge]'s inverse law wants a STOPPING merge, not a skipping one:
     with "a [true] at an exhausted [d1] consumes the selector and
     produces nothing" the law [pmerge_take] is false (see the comment at
     [pmerge]).  Landed stopping, which makes [pmerge_take] and hence
     [pmerge_prefix] unconditional.  (The name is [pmerge] and not [merge]
     so as not to shadow stdpp's map [merge], which lane PIPE-2W will
     import beside this file.)
   - [pipe_phi] takes the history alone, as [FileDisc.file_phi] does; the
     [gstate] argument [AppEcho.echo_phi] carries is the record's, and
     lane PIPE-STAGE adds it. *)

(* ---- IS THIS RUN A SHUFFLE OF THE TWO FORK-ROUND SOURCES? ------------ *)

(* THE TEST THE TERMINAL ROUND IS READ BY (lane PIPE-MODEL-3, design
   section 4.3h).  A pipeline round whose [fork1] failed has TWO live
   writers -- the runcmd child and sh's main loop between them write
   [alt_forkc] ("fork\n$ "), and the STRAY left child, whose own exec
   failed, writes a prefix of [dg_execL] at any time, including after the
   prompt.  So the round's bytes are a shuffle of the two lists, and
   [shufb] is that test, by recursion on the run: at each byte, take it
   from the left source or from the right one.  It PRUNES at the first
   byte that matches neither, which is why it evaluates in milliseconds
   on the demos below even though its worst case is exponential.

   [pmergeable] is the test and not the existential [exists sel, ...] on
   purpose: it is decidable and [vm_compute]-able BY CONSTRUCTION, which
   is what discipline rule D4 and the decision procedure of

   [PForkS] IS THE TERMINAL ROUND (lane PIPE-MODEL-3, design section
   4.3h, owner's ruling "strays" of 2026-09-21).  [runcmd]'s PIPE arm
   forks TWICE and does not wait between the forks: if [fork1] #2 fails
   after #1 succeeded, the runcmd child prints "fork\n" and exits while
   child 1 is ALIVE, and child 1's own [exec /echo] may fail -- so a
   STRAY writer prints a prefix of [dg_execL] at any later time,
   byte-interleaved with the panic, with sh's prompt and with anything
   after it.  The old constant [PFork] is the interleaving that got no
   stray byte, [PForkS (replicate (length alt_forkc) false)]
   ([pcont_forkS_old]).  What stops the interleaving from spreading into
   the NEXT round is discipline rule D4 ([d4_p]): a round whose block is
   a shuffle of the two sources is the LAST round of the covered
   session.

   [PPipe] AND [PForkS] END IN THE PROMPT, not in a fresh prologue: [runcmd]
   runs in the shell's forked child, so [panic] there exits the CHILD, the
   parent's [wait(0)] returns and it prints the next prompt.  The MAIN
   loop's own [fork1] panic -- which does kill the shell and re-enter
   init's prologue -- is [EchoDisc]'s alternative 3, i.e. [PEcho 3]. *)

(* ---- D4: THE COVERED SESSION ENDS AT A FORK-FAILURE ROUND ----------- *)

(* DISCIPLINE RULE D4 (design section 4.3h, owner's ruling "strays" of
   2026-09-21, as REPAIRED by this lane).  A pipeline round whose [fork1]
   failed leaves a STRAY writer alive: it prints a prefix of [dg_execL] at
   any later time, so nothing the session prints after such a round is a
   function of the input any more.  D4 is the premise that stops there:
   A ROUND WHOSE BLOCK IS A SHUFFLE OF THE TWO SOURCES IS THE LAST ROUND
   OF THE COVERED SESSION -- no further line, and no further byte typed.

   IT IS STATED ON THE BYTES ([pmergeable]) AND NOT ON THE ALTERNATIVE,
   and that is the lane's one correction to the ruling.  "The resolution
   has [PForkS] at line [i]" is NOT enough, because the wire does not
   say which alternative ran: at [echo fork | cat] the GOOD run [PRan]
   prints [wl_line ["fork"] ++ u_prompt], which is [alt_forkc] byte for
   byte -- so a user who typed that line, had its [fork1] fail, and
   typed on would be inside a [PRan]-resolved discipline while a stray
   child was still writing, and [pipe_phi] would be FALSE at that trace
   ([d4_ambiguous] in section 8 is the witness).  Reading D4 off the
   BYTES closes that: the [PRan] resolution of such a round is a shuffle
   too, so it ends the covered session as well.  The price is exactly
   the confusable lines, and it is a fact about the WIRE, which is what
   design section 4.3h asks a stray premise to be.

   THE PRICE, MEASURED AND REPORTED: the test is on [pcont] and not on
   the whole block, so it does not read the prologue a PANIC round
   re-enters -- and [alt_panic] ("fork\n") is ITSELF a shuffle prefix.
   So D4 as landed ALSO ends the covered session at sh's main-loop fork
   panic, at either line shape.  That is sound and it is honest ("fork\n"
   on the wire does not say which process wrote it), but it is wider
   than the ruling asks for.  Narrowing it to "the block is a COMPLETE
   fork block" needs the test to read [alt_cont_p] -- the prologue
   included, because a panic followed by a BARE-PROMPT prologue is
   [alt_forkc] byte for byte and the model admits that prologue
   ([pro_alts !!! 0]) -- and then [d4_p] depends on [ps], which
   [PipeDiscDec]'s prologue canonicalisation does not preserve.  A
   ruling is asked for.

   [d4_p] is a [Forall] over [seq] rather than a bounded quantifier so
   that it is decidable and [vm_compute]-able, which is what
   [PipeDiscDec] and the demos of section 8 need. *)

     KILLED.  Either the token at SOME position with the payload's half of

     process whose console input broke the discipline pays with, and which
     is persistent, so that arm costs nothing to produce twice.

     CONSTANT IN THE STATUS ([ucons_pay_const]), which is the whole of what
     sh's exit stub needs: the leaf's premise is
     [ukn_pay N (-1) -∗ ukn_pay N xs ∧ ukn_pay N (-1)], and at a payload
     that does not read the status one resource answers both conjuncts.

     [T] IS A PARAMETER and not [AppEcho.echo_taint]: the program tier
     names no application.  The application instantiates it at the entry
     constructor, exactly as [UInitSh.init_sh_slot] takes its taint.

     ...AND SO IS [Rd], THE READER'S OWN PER-POSITION CREDENTIAL (lane
     IO-LEAF, M5).  The console lease is not the only exclusive right that
     travels init -> shell -> init on this payload: the application's input
     claim keeps a DELIVERED COUNT ([EchoOut.dl_cnt]) whose reader half the
     shell must hold to read the console at all, and that half moves in
     lockstep with the ring's cursor -- every console read advances both by
     the window it consumed.  So it rides HERE, under the SAME existential
     [n] as [upos_a], which is the only place the two numbers can be said
     to agree: a holder of [upos γ n] pins the existential by
     [upos_agree], and reads [Rd] at its own count.
     A PARAMETER for [T]'s reason exactly -- the program tier names no
     application and no era -- and it is [emp]-able: an application with
     nothing to say about its input instantiates it at [fun _ => emp] and
     every lemma below is the landed one. *)

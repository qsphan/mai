(* SpecSafestrcpy.v -- the public interface of safestrcpy() (kernel/string.c),
   stated independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer --
   never a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be
   checked in parallel.

     char *safestrcpy(char *s, const char *t, int n) {
       char *os = s;
       if (n <= 0) return os;
       while (--n > 0 && ( *s++ = *t++) != 0) ;
       *s = 0;
       return os;
     }

   @ KernelSyms.safestrcpy = 0x80000e1c, 52 bytes: a 2-slot ra/s0 frame, a
   [blez] fast-return, and one byte-at-a-time copy loop with no callees.

   UNLIKE copyinstr's, THE SOURCE HERE IS A KNOWN, OWNED KERNEL BUFFER --
   [p->name], never user memory -- so the postcondition can and does name the
   exact stop index and the exact bytes copied, rather than copyinstr's
   existential-k, contents-blind [bb_cstr] arm.  [ssc_stop] is that pure
   characterization, worked out by hand-tracing the two ways the loop can
   exit (see below); [ssc_post] is what it implies about the destination.

   THE TWO WAYS THE LOOP STOPS, both already visible in the C:

   - t HOLDS A NUL WITHIN THE FIRST [n-1] BYTES ([k < n-1], [f k = 0], every
     earlier byte nonzero).  The loop's OWN check ([( *s++ = *t++) != 0])
     copies that NUL into [s] at index [k] and then breaks -- but [s]/[t]
     were already incremented as part of the assignment, so the pointer is
     now at [k+1] when the loop exits.  The unconditional [*s = 0] after the
     loop therefore writes a SECOND NUL at index [k+1] (distinct from the
     first, and always in-bounds since [k <= n-2]).  Bytes past [k+1] are
     untouched.
   - t HAS NO NUL IN THE FIRST [n-1] BYTES.  The loop runs its full budget
     ([n-1] iterations, copying indices [0..n-2]) and exits because the
     counter -- not a NUL -- ran out, leaving the pointer at [n-1].  The
     trailing [*s = 0] then writes the ONE terminator at [n-1], truncating
     whatever [t] held there (which the loop never even read).

   Both cases are subsumed by ONE stop index [k] (the first case's own [k],
   or [n-1] as the sentinel for the second) and ONE shape for the result:
   bytes strictly below [k] are copied verbatim, [s]'s byte AT [k] is always
   the NUL terminator (copied-and-zero in the first case, forced in the
   second), [k+1] gets a SECOND explicit NUL when it is still in bounds
   (exactly the first case), and everything past that is untouched.

   HOW MUCH OF THE SOURCE THE CALLER MUST OWN: [ssc_src_ok], and it is a
   DISJUNCTION rather than the [ns = n] this contract used to demand.  The
   loop reads [t[0 .. n-2]] at most and stops early at the first NUL, so
   there are two ways to be safe:

   - [n - 1 <= ns] -- you own everything the loop's BUDGET can reach.  Every
     caller holding a fixed-size buffer at least as long as the field is
     here, kfork's [safestrcpy(np->name, p->name, 16)] included, at
     [ns = n = 16].
   - THERE IS A NUL STRICTLY INSIDE WHAT YOU OWN -- the loop stops at or
     before it and never reads past.

   This header used to record the [ns = n] form as an over-ask that was
   "harmless and simpler, since every caller already owns that much".  It
   stopped being harmless when exec became a caller: kexec's source is
   [last], a pointer INTO the path string, and sixteen bytes past [last] run
   off the end of the caller's [char path[MAXPATH]].  What exec owns is the
   rest of the string, and the string's own terminator is exactly what makes
   that enough -- the second disjunct.

   Note what does NOT need saying alongside it: the postcondition still
   speaks of [f j] only for [j < k], and [k < ns] holds under either
   disjunct (under the second, a NUL inside the owned range refutes
   [bb_nonul f (n-1)] and forces the [k < n-1] arm of [ssc_stop]).  So no
   conjunct of the result reaches a byte the caller does not own, and the
   result shape is unchanged.

   [n <= 0] IS ITS OWN ARM: the destination is untouched and the return
   value is the unmodified [s] pointer -- [os = s], read straight off the
   argument register, since nothing between entry and the early [ret]
   touches [a0]. *)

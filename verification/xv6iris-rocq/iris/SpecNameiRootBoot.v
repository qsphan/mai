(* SpecNameiRootBoot.v -- [namei("/")] AT THE BOOT CLIENT'S PREMISES.

   This is [SpecNamei.wp_namei_root_body] with the four INODE-CACHE rows
   removed and nothing else changed: same entry, same budget, same lock
   order, same two path bytes, same [IcacheHeld.inode_held] out.  It is the
   ONE assumed contract in the boot cone ([LinkNameiRootBoot.v] holds the
   [Axiom]), and it replaced a much larger one -- [userinit]'s whole body,
   which is now PROVEN against it ([ProofUserinit.v]).

   ---- WHAT IS ASSUMED, EXACTLY ------------------------------------------

   The delta against the PROVEN corner ([ProofNameiRoot.v] /
   [LinkNameiRoot.v], which discharges [SpecNamei.NAMEI_ROOT]) is four
   rows and no more:

     is_itable2 γl cn γfs γi cov logstart nib dev     the itable spinlock
     itable_inv                                       the fifty [ref] words
     ic_escrows cn γfs γi cov logstart                every entry's escrow
     ireg_inv γi γfs inodestart nib                   the inode region

   All four are [namei]'s only because they are [SpecIget]'s: namei's body
   is one [namex] call, namex's absolute arm is one [iget(ROOTDEV, ROOTINO)],
   and iget takes them to acquire [itable.lock], to open the [ref] words
   across its read-modify-writes, to name whichever of the fifty slots its
   scan stops at, and (ghost-only, on the recycle arm) to move the region's
   count half from 0 to 1.  Nothing else in userinit's cone names any of
   them.

   ALL FOUR ARE PERSISTENT, and that is what makes this a clean seam: the
   assumption is not about a resource being spent, it is about the cache
   EXISTING at the moment userinit runs.  It does not yet, because
   [IcacheBoot.icache_boot] -- the one fupd that produces the first three,
   with [IcacheBoot.ireg_alloc] for the fourth -- needs the stocked inode
   pool, which needs the fs BLOCK layer wired into main
   (claude-notes/projects/fs-icache.md, C7 owed (ii)/(c)).

   ---- HOW IT GETS DISCHARGED --------------------------------------------

   By APPLYING the proof that already exists.  When main can hand over the
   four rows, [LinkNameiRootBoot.v]'s [Axiom] is replaced by a functor over
   [LinkNameiRoot.NameiRoot] that simply supplies them -- the boot client
   holds them, this contract does not mention them, and every premise below
   is already one of [SpecNamei.wp_namei_root_body]'s.  No proof about
   namei has to be redone, and userinit's does not change at all.

   ---- THE TWO CONFIG TIES ARE *NOT* PREMISES, AND THAT IS A FINDING -----

   [icfg_dev = ROOTDEV] and [0 < icfg_nib] are the conditions under which
   the corner's [iget(1,1)] is a reference THIS cache can hold
   ([SpecIget]'s [bv_unsigned ROOTINO < 16 * nib]), and they matter: at
   [icfg_nib = 0] the [IcacheHeld.inode_held] this contract returns carries
   [bv_unsigned inum < 0] and cannot exist, so the assumption would be
   vacuous rather than merely unproved.

   THEY ARE STILL NOT PREMISES, because a premise has to be dischargeable by
   the caller and these are not -- not at [SystemAdequacy]'s concrete
   functor list, which is where they would have to land.  [icfg] reaches a
   proof as a superclass FIELD of [FileInv.fileG], and at [xv6Σ] that
   instance is [subG_fileΣ], whose body is [solve_inG] closed by **Qed**.
   So [icfg_dev] is stuck behind an opaque constant: [reflexivity] fails
   with "unable to unify ROOTDEV with icfg_dev" even though the instance
   plainly says [mword_of_int 1], and [vm_compute] -- which ignores opacity
   -- does not fail either, it grinds through the [solve_inG] term for
   fifteen minutes and reports nothing.  (Same failure shape as
   durable-notes.md's "vm_compute on a goal containing a section variable
   does not fail, it HANGS", one level over.)

   This is fs-icache.md C7 (c)'s ambient-[icfg] tie seen from below, and it
   is structural: nothing can be proved about the cache's configuration
   until [IcacheRefDefs.icfg_alloc] runs inside the boot fupd.  So the
   configuration is a property of the INSTANCE instead, and
   [SystemAdequacy.adequacy_icfg] is chosen to satisfy it -- see the note
   there.  Anyone re-pointing this [Axiom] at [LinkNameiRoot.NameiRoot]
   supplies the ties from the same place the four icache rows come from.

   ---- WHAT IS *NOT* ASSUMED ---------------------------------------------

   Everything the corner does with the two path bytes, the frame, the
   register discipline and the epilogue is still PROVEN -- [ProofNameiRoot]
   and [ProofNamexRoot] are untouched and stay in the build against
   [SpecNamei.NAMEI_ROOT].  This file does not weaken them; it states the
   same walk at the premises the boot client can actually produce. *)

(*  FirstTok.v -- proc.c's [static int first], AS A RESOURCE A PROCESS
    CARRIES.

    forkret's first act after [release(&p->lock)] is

        if (first) { fsinit(); ...; first = 0; ...; }

    and the branch is decided by WHICH ARM OF THIS DISJUNCTION the running
    process holds.  That is the whole design: no invariant, no mask, no
    atomicity argument.  Upstream used to spell the read and the write as
    [__atomic_load_n(&first, __ATOMIC_ACQUIRE)] / [__atomic_store_n(&first,
    0, __ATOMIC_RELEASE)]; the plain variable is the SAME one-shot here,
    because what made it one is the exclusivity of [first_addr |-> 1] and
    not the fences.  Nothing below changes: the fences were never
    load-bearing (they walked as state-preserving no-ops over an SC ptsto
    model), and the store still sits between [fsinit] and [kexec].

    The resource decides the branch, and the two arms are mutually
    exclusive as resources, so the kernel's own "exactly one process ever
    takes it" is a theorem about ownership rather than a claim about
    scheduling.

      - [first_addr ↦₄ 1] is EXCLUSIVE.  At most one process can hold it,
        and holding it is the right to run the boot arm: fsinit, the store
        of 0, kexec("/init").  The boot chain deposits it into the FIRST
        process's block ([SpecUserinit]) and nothing else can ever have it.

      - [first_addr ↦₄□ 0 ∗ fs_ready] is PERSISTENT, hence free for every
        process forever.  A process holding it reads 0, so the [c.beqz] at
        forkret+0x1c is TAKEN and the boot arm is dead -- and it already
        has the file system it would otherwise have had to build.

    The two cannot coexist: [DfracOwn 1] and [DfracDiscarded] at one
    address are incompatible, so the moment the boot arm persists its
    store, no second holder of the exclusive arm can exist.  That is the
    one-shot, without a one-shot ghost.

    WHY [fs_ready] RIDES IN THE SECOND ARM.  forkret's tail hands the trap
    loop a residue, and the loop's bundle wants the fs environment.  In the
    boot arm forkret BUILDS it (fsinit's post, sealed by
    [FsReady.fs_ready_establish]); in the steady arm it must already have
    it, and the only honest source is the process's own block.  Carrying it
    here is what lets forkret's contract drop the [first] premise
    altogether instead of trading it for an fs premise. *)

  (* ================================================================== *)

  (* THE ALLOCATOR ROW IS THE *BUNDLE*, NOT THE SPELLED PAIR, and the
     spelling is forced by WHO CAN PRODUCE IT (fs-cfg-boot.md (f-4), debt F,
     and its successor decision point D4).

     [fs_ready_pre] row 17 wants [kalloc_avail fsc_kpages None] -- the pair
     NAMED.  Nobody can hand that over.  The seal is
     [KallocInv.kalloc_avail_seal], which consumes the EXCLUSIVE counted
     token; the last counted draw in the whole boot is allocproc's, inside
     userinit; and what allocproc gives back is [KvmSpec.kalloc_env], whose
     [∃ γk] has already swallowed the name ([WpLock.is_lock] has no
     resource-agreement lemma, so no equation recovers it).  So the earliest
     moment the sealed regime EXISTS, it exists only in bundled form -- and
     the token has to carry what its one producer can produce, or userinit's
     park cannot be typed at all.

     WHAT THIS LEAVES OPEN, precisely: [first_persist_pre] below still takes
     [kalloc_avail fsc_kpages None] as its own argument, because
     [FsReady.fs_ready_pre] still spells it.  Bridging the two is exactly
     debt F / D4 (spell the pair through allocproc, or relax [fs_ready]'s
     rows 16+17 to this same bundle) and it is a separate, chartered change:
     [fs_ready]'s spelled pair is re-exported by
     [ProofSyscall.sysc_fs_env], so relaxing it moves the fileclose cone.

     THAT RESIDUAL IS GONE, and the row below is how.  What used to stand
     here said the token carries the bundle and that one named row was still
     owed at a seal site that did not exist yet.  The seal site exists now
     (forkret's boot arm), and the fix was not to bridge the two forms but
     to store the right one.

     THE ALLOCATOR ROW IS THE NAMED HALF, NOT [KvmSpec.kalloc_env], and the
     bundle was never the right thing to store.  [kalloc_env]'s [∃ γk]
     swallows the free-list name, and [WpLock.is_lock] is an [inv] -- Iris
     invariants do not agree -- so nothing recovers [γk = fsc_kpages].  The
     boot arm's whole point is the SEAL, and [FsReady.fs_ready_pre]'s row 17
     spells the pair named; a hidden name can never satisfy it.  Worse, the
     bundle's own [is_lock] duplicated the one [first_boot_persist] already
     carries at the real name, so the row was paying for a copy of a fact it
     had and hiding the one fact it needed.

     Nothing derives the BUNDLE from this, because nothing has to: the only
     consumer of the bundled form on this arm is kexec, which runs after the
     seal and takes it from [FsReady.fs_ready_kalloc].

     THE PRODUCER PAYS FOR IT WITH ONE [iDestruct].  [KvmSpec.kalloc_env]
     no longer quantifies the free-list pair -- it names [fsc_kpages], which
     is what [FsCfg]'s own note on that field says it should do and what
     makes the bundle "recovered as a projection" true in both directions.
     So [ProofUserinit], which holds the bundle when it deposits the token,
     projects this row straight out of it.  Before that change the row was
     unreachable from a bundle at all ([WpLock.is_lock] is an [inv], and
     Iris invariants do not agree), which is the whole reason the pinning
     happened. *)
  (* THE BOOT ARM, AS A NAME OF ITS OWN.  The four rows are a resource a
     party can hold OUTSIDE the block: [ParkCap.park_child] carries them as
     separate rows on the BOOT mode, because that is the mode's whole
     content -- "the record this parks is the first process" is exactly
     "the record's token is on this arm", and a package that says one and
     not the other leaves forkret with a steady resume of a boot record it
     cannot refute.  Split out here so the two sides of that seam are one
     proposition. *)

     pay the child out of its own.  What it can carry is this: the steady
     arm alone, persistent, hence free to hand to every child forever.

     WHERE IT COMES FROM.  It is a conjunct of [ProofSyscall.syscall_env],
     the ambient bundle usertrap hands the dispatcher, and it is threaded
     [SpecSysFork] -> [SpecKfork] -> [kfork_arm3] -> [kfk_b4], where
     [first_tok_of_done] mints the child's token.  Nothing in the tree
     CONSTRUCTS [syscall_env] today (it arrives abstractly as usertrap's
     [Rsys]), so the obligation to produce this row lands exactly where
     forkret will discharge it: forkret's boot arm persists the store and

  (* [FsReady.fs_geom_ok]'s eleven fields OFF THE DURABLE SNAPSHOT
     (durable-disk lane E-himg).  Every field is either a configuration
     tie, a projection of [FsImg.fs_sb_ok] (which [FsDurSnap.sk_sbok]
     delivers at the era's OWN superblock), or one of the two coverage
     readings of [snap_bytes]:

       - [FsDurSnap.snap_cov_window] -- every block of the metadata window
         is covered, because the snapshot NAMES it (block 1, the inode
         region, the bitmap block) or it is a log block, and the log region
         is covered by the caller's own era-independent fact;
       - [FsDurSnap.snap_cov_below] -- every covered block is a real block
         of THIS era, because the ledger's keys are the home blocks and
         [sk_dombelow] bounds them by [size].

     THAT SECOND ONE IS WHY THE ERA'S [cov] AND THE ERA'S SUPERBLOCK CAN BE
     RELATED AT ALL: [cov] is fixed across power cycles and [FsState.fss_sb S] is
     not.  [fgo_ushort] is [FsImg.sbo_ushort], the superblock's own
     "an inum is a [ushort]" clause -- nothing outside the record bounds
     the inode region that tightly. *)

   242 bytes, 97 instructions -- writei's structural twin, and simpler in
   every way that matters:

   ==== READI MODIFIES NOTHING =========================================

   No [log_write], no [iupdate], no [inode_meta] update, no log resources at
   all: [inode_map], [inode_blocks] and [inode_meta] come back at the SAME
   [bm], [data] and [dn].  There is therefore no [log_op] budget, no
   [log_ctx], no [γ : log_names], and no disturbed region -- writei's
   three-way range clause (kernel defect D1's fix) has no analogue here,
   because the failure path releases a buffer it never touched.

   ==== ...WHICH IS WHY IT NEEDS bm_covers ==============================

   readi calls bmap, and bmap ALLOCATES when the slot is zero -- which calls
   log_write.  But fileread does not wrap readi in a transaction, so an
   allocating read would hit panic("log_write outside of trans").  It never
   happens because every block below a file's size is allocated, and
   [InodeInv.bm_covers] is that statement; under it every one of readi's
   bmap calls satisfies [SpecBmap.BMAP_NOALLOC]'s single extra premise
   ([InodeInv.bm_covers_off] does the /BSIZE and returns both the index
   bound and the nonzero fact).  Design:
   claude-notes/design/fs-inode.md, "readi, and why it forced a no-alloc
   bmap".

   [bm_covers] is not restated in the postcondition: [bm] and [dn] come back
   LITERALLY unchanged, so the caller's own premise still holds of them.

   ==== THE FILE'S SIZE BOUNDS THE BLOCK INDEX =========================

   readi has NO MAXFILE*BSIZE check of its own -- it clamps [n] to the file's
   end instead and trusts the size.  So the file-system invariant
   [ip->size <= MAXFILE*BSIZE] is a genuine PREMISE here: without it a file
   claiming a larger size would drive bmap past MAXFILE and into its
   panic("bmap: out of range").  It also subsumes the size's 2^31 bound.

   ==== WHAT COMES BACK, AND WHERE ======================================

   The bytes DELIVERED are the file's bytes.  Stated on the flat byte view
   [InodeInv.file_byte] -- readi's postcondition is writei's range clause
   run in the other direction, over the same [inode_blocks] -- and, because
   the destination's untouched tail is equally nameable, with NO existential
   at all: after reading [tot] bytes the destination holds

     rd_delivered data dst_olds off tot
       = fun i => if i < tot then file_byte data (off + i) else dst_olds i

   which is exact on both ends.  (writei needed an existential [wrote]
   because its SOURCE was user memory; readi's source is the file, which the
   caller's own [inode_blocks] names.)

   That clause lives inside the [if user], because the destination is a
   pointer into ONE OF TWO ADDRESS SPACES and which one is a run-time
   argument -- exactly what [either_copyout]'s ghost [user] flag is for
   (claude-notes/completed/either-copy.md names readi/writei as the reason
   it is a ghost boolean).  readi THREADS the flag: [proc_priv] is required
   only on the user arm.

   ON THE USER ARM THE SAME CLAUSE IS AN EQUATION ON THE PROCESS'S MEMORY.
   The block comes back at

     upd_usM (us_upt U P') (umem_wr (us_M U) dst tot (rd_bytes data off))

   -- the image it went in at, with the file's bytes [off .. off+tot)
   written at user va [dst .. dst+tot).  It pins the untouched bytes as
   firmly as the written ones, and it is the SAME [tot] the return value
   names, on BOTH arms: a copy that faulted part-way reports -1 but still
   moved [tot] bytes, and [tot] is what readi's [tot] IS.  (That is why the
   -1 arm's [tot] is not the loop counter but the loop counter plus
   whatever the failing chunk managed -- see [ProofReadi]'s +0xb0 exit.)
   [UserPtTree.umem_wr] is keyed by the 64-bit va, so the statement need not
   promise that [dst + tot] does not wrap; a caller that knows it does not
   reads bytes back with [umem_wr_lookup_in] / [umem_wr_lookup_out].

   ==== THE RETURN VALUE IS EXACT =======================================

   Two arms, not three.  Under [bm_covers] the "bmap returned 0" break is
   DEAD, so the only way to stop early is [either_copyout] faulting -- which
   returns 0 unconditionally on the kernel arm.  Hence:

   - a0 = -1 and [user = true] -- the copy out faulted part-way;
   - a0 = tot and [tot = rd_clamp (di_size dn) off n] -- the whole clamped
     count was read.

   The up-front bounds failure ([off > ip->size]) is NOT a third arm: it
   returns 0, and [rd_clamp] is 0 there, so it IS the second arm with
   [tot = 0].  Collapsing them is what makes the contract exact rather than
   merely bounded -- a caller learns that a returning readi read everything
   there was to read.

   ==== off AND n ARE FULL 32-BIT uints =================================

   Both are C [uint]s, so both range over [0, 2^32) -- and the RV64 ABI
   hands a 32-bit argument over SIGN-EXTENDED, [uint] included, so a value
   at or above 2^31 arrives in a3/a4 as a NEGATIVE 64-bit word.  That is
   what the two register premises spell:

     m a3 = sign_extend' 64 (mword_of_int (Z.of_nat off) : mword 32)

   Below 2^31 that IS the plain literal ([rd_arg32_small]), so a caller who
   had the old premise still reads the same one rewrite later.

   THE POSTCONDITION DOES NOT MOVE WITH THE WIDENING.  [rd_clamp] is already
   0 at [off > size], and a 32-bit [off] at or above 2^31 is past the end of
   every file (the size is bounded by MAXFILE*BSIZE), so the arm the
   widening opens is the arm that was already there -- the pre-frame exit,
   returning 0.  What the widening costs is one reading of the [bltu a5,a3]
   at +0x002: a sign-extended-negative a3 is ABOVE the size as an unsigned
   64-bit word, which is what makes that 64-bit compare decide the 32-bit
   unsigned one the C is written in.

   COVERAGE NOTE: the joint numeric premise [off + n < 2^32] is the sum in
   the MATHEMATICAL integers, and it is what makes the [c.addw a4,a3] at
   +0x022 non-wrapping.  It is the one thing this contract asks beyond
   32-bittedness, and it is what leaves xv6's own [off + n < off] overflow
   test dead by premise rather than proving what the code does when it
   fires.

   IT IS GUARDED BY THE SIZE TEST -- [off <= ip->size -> off + n < 2^32] --
   and the guard is not a convenience, it is what the instruction order
   already says: +0x022 is BEHIND the [bltu a5,a3] at +0x002, so the add is
   reached only for an [off] inside the file, where a size at most
   MAXFILE*BSIZE makes the bound free.  Ungard it and the contract excludes
   exactly the offsets the size test rejects, which is the case kexec's
   phdr read hands over -- [elf.phoff] is four untrusted bytes, [n] is 56,
   and nothing in exec bounds the sum.  The guard opens only [off > size],
   where [rd_clamp] is already 0, so THE POSTCONDITION DOES NOT MOVE; the
   case that would move it (a small [off] with [n] near 2^32, sum wrapping
   while [rd_clamp] is nonzero) sits under the guard and still owes the
   bound.

   readi SLEEPS (bmap, bread, brelse, and copyout on the user arm), so it
   threads the full running-process bundle.  It enters and returns at
   noff 0. *)

     }

   98 bytes, 40 instructions.  TWO arms and one epilogue, and the whole of the
   second arm is a [c.li a0,-1] that jumps into the middle of the first arm's
   restore sequence.

   ==== THE DISPATCH, AS gcc WROTE IT ===================================

   There is no two-way test in the object code.  [+0x14] loads [f->type],
   [+0x16] subtracts 2, and [+0x1a] is a single [bltu a4,a5] against 1 -- so
   "FD_INODE or FD_DEVICE" is the UNSIGNED RANGE TEST [type - 2 <= 1], and the
   branch is taken exactly when the file is NEITHER.  Both surviving types
   carry an inode in [f->ip] and take the identical path: filestat never looks
   at [f->major] and never reaches [devsw], which is why -- unlike fileread and
   filewrite -- it has no device arm and no indirect call.

   The AST's [BTYPE] field order is [(imm, rs2, rs1, op)], so the recorded
   [BTYPE (68, a5, a4, BLTU)] is [bltu a4,a5]; reading it the other way would
   invert the dispatch and give FD_INODE the error arm.

   ==== struct stat LIVES ON FILESTAT'S OWN FRAME =======================

   [+0x2a] is [addi s2,s0,-72], i.e. [&st = sp + 8] in an 80-byte (10-slot)
   frame: the 24-byte struct occupies frame slots 9, 8 and 7 exactly
   ([StackBytes.slots3_bytes_own] at [k = 9]).  Two consequences, and they are
   the whole answer to the fs-namei close-out's item 4 ("the stat hole"):

   * NOTHING ABOUT THE STAT BUFFER APPEARS IN THIS CONTRACT.  The buffer is
     filestat's own stack, carved out of the [stack_own] that [sie_cap_gpr]
     already carries and handed back at the epilogue.  A caller owes the
     SLOTS -- that is what [filestat_stack <= K] says -- and nothing else.

   * THE FOUR HOLE BYTES (12..15, the alignment gap before the 8-byte
     [st->size] that [SpecStati.stat_at] deliberately does not mention) NEED
     NO CLAUSE EITHER.  They are frame bytes whose contents [stack_own] leaves
     existential; stati does not write them; copyout copies all 24 bytes and
     its contract says NOTHING about what the user pages end up holding (see
     SpecCopyout.v's header -- [proc_pt] owns its pages with existential
     contents).  So there is no resource anywhere in this cone that could
     record the hole's value, and quantifying it would be a claim about the
     user's memory that the layer below cannot deliver.  The honest statement
     is silence, and it costs a caller nothing.

   ==== THE REFERENCE, AND WHAT SELECTS THE ENVIRONMENT ==================

   SpecFileread.v's shape, and for the same reason.  filestat takes
   [file_ref γf k q] at an ARBITRARY q -- it is a borrower, not a reference
   holder -- and gives it back unchanged.  The type is read out of the
   reference's own content fraction, so the loaded word IS [fc_type Cf] and
   the branch being taken is the Coq fact about [Cf]; no ghost state has to
   tell an inode from a pipe.

   What a caller must own therefore depends on the type, and only two cases
   exist:

   * FD_INODE or FD_DEVICE -> ilock's and iunlock's environment: the icache
     seam, the block cache and the disk fabric.  NOT readi's or writei's --
     filestat reads no data block, so no log, no bitmap, no [inode_map] and
     no [inode_blocks] appear.  stati wants only [InodeInv.inode_meta] and the
     two identity halves, all three of which ride inside the [ic_loaded] that
     ilock hands out.
   * anything else -> NOTHING.  The arm is the [c.li a0,-1] at +0x5e, which
     touches no state at all.  Note that this is NOT a panic: filestat is the
     one function in this batch whose "wrong type" case is an ordinary error
     return (fileread and filewrite both panic there).

   THE OFFSET DOES NOT APPEAR.  [f->off] is not read and not written, so
   the off LEDGER -- which fileread's walk opens -- is never opened here.

   ==== WHAT IS AMBIENT =================================================

   [proc_priv], [kalloc_env] and [procs_inv] are premises of the contract
   proper rather than of an arm: myproc runs before the dispatch, and the
   surviving arm copies into user memory (copyout reaches vmfault, hence
   kalloc).  The error arm hands all of it straight back.  Every caller of
   filestat is a syscall and holds all three already.

   ==== WHAT THE POSTCONDITION SAYS =====================================

   Two things, and no more:

   * the return value is 0 or -1.  The [sraiw a0,a0,31] at +0x4a is the
     [< 0 ? -1 : 0] idiom applied to copyout's own two-valued result, so the
     first arm answers exactly what copyout did, re-encoded;
   * the process block comes back at an EXTENDED page table ([uptd_ext]) --
     copyout's [vmfault] may have mapped pages, and that is the only trace it
     leaves that this layer can see.

   IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT THE USER READS BACK, and that is inherited from
   copyout rather than lost here: see the header above and SpecCopyout.v's.
   A caller that wants "the user's struct stat now holds this inode's
   metadata" needs a contents-indexed refinement of [proc_pt], which the
   user-execution layer cannot carry through a return to user mode anyway. *)

(* filestat's own frame is 10 slots ([c.addi16sp sp,-80]: ra, s0, s1, s4
   spilled unconditionally, s2 and s3 spilled only on the surviving arm, three
   slots for [struct stat] and one unused), and its deepest callee is COPYOUT
   at 52 -- which dominates ilock's 44, iunlock's 26, myproc's 10 and stati's

   52, NOT 50, AND THE 10 GETS NO TRAP RESERVE.  copyout's budget rose
   because [psz] has to outlive walkaddr / vmfault / memmove, so gcc gave it a
   callee-saved home in s11 and copyout's frame grew to 14 slots

     WHY THE BYTES ARE EXISTENTIAL AND NOT THE STRUCT'S FIELDS: the proof
     names the source run with [fst_bytes_name24], i.e. it borrows the
     already-built frame buffer rather than re-deriving the little-endian
     encoding of dev/ino/type/nlink/size.  Pinning [bs] to those fields is a

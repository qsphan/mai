(** ** [lia] does NOT expand [mod]/[div]

    Stdlib's [ZifyNat] and [ZifyN] redefine
    [zify_convert_to_euclidean_division_equations_flag] to [true], and an
    Ltac [::=] takes effect for every file that merely LOADS the module.
    stdpp's [bitvector.definitions] requires [ZifyNat] (since stdpp master,
    2026), so without the line below every [lia]/[nia] downstream of it --
    nearly the whole tree -- rewrites each [x mod m] and [x / m] into a fresh
    quotient and remainder with five guarded side conditions.  No proof here
    needs that; it makes [lia] a few percent slower everywhere and [nia]
    unboundedly slow on a context holding [_ mod 2 ^ 64] terms (one [nia] in
    ProofItruncParts.v went from a fraction of a second to not finishing).

    The two modules are required above so that they are loaded BEFORE this
    redefinition in every file that loads this one; a later [Require] of them
    is a no-op and cannot turn the flag back on.  A proof that wants the
    expansion says [Z.to_euclidean_division_equations] itself. *)

(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *)
(** ** COST

    The filter is charged to all ~20k [lia] call sites in this tree, so its
    per-call cost is the whole design constraint.  Measured on ProofBmap.v
    (96 calls, mean context 190 hypotheses), the first version cost 60 ms a
    call against a filtered [lia] of 10 ms, and every millisecond of it was
    Ltac2 interpretation of one of three loops:

      - 18 ms  the skeleton walk, because recognising a head meant
               [List.exist Constr.equal] down a 78-element [constr list] AT
               EVERY NODE.  Now the vocabulary is three [FSet]s keyed by
               [constant]/[inductive]/[constructor] and a head costs one
               [Constr.Unsafe.kind] and one [FSet.mem].
      - 19 ms  [SetShrink.vars_of] over the type of every hypothesis KEPT, to
               build the live-variable set.  Gone: only the GOAL is scanned
               (it is small, and [vars_of] skips an evar's instance), and a
               hypothesis-to-hypothesis dependency -- rare, and the only
               other way a [clear] can be ill-formed -- is left to
               [SetShrink.clear_greedily], which bisects and keeps the halves
               that do go.  That is the same answer Coq's own [clear] check
               gives, obtained without traversing the context in Ltac2.
      - 14 ms  the [doomed] scan, [List.mem] over a keep-list and a
               live-list that had grown to every variable in the context.
               With the live set down to the goal's variables this is a scan
               over a handful of names.

      -  7 ms  [is_prop], one [Constr.type] retyping per non-arithmetic
               hypothesis -- load-bearing, so it could not go, but it could
               get cheaper: retyping the HEAD of an application and reading
               the sort off its arity settles the question for almost every
               hypothesis at a ninth of the price.  See [is_prop].

    That is 60 ms a call down to ~6, against a filtered [lia] of ~10.

    THE RULE THIS LEAVES BEHIND: never put a [constr:(...)] quotation, a
    [constr list] scan, or a [SetShrink.vars_of] on a path that runs once per
    hypothesis or once per node.  A quotation is re-elaborated at every
    evaluation, so [Constr.equal f constr:(@eq)] inside the walk was a
    pretyping call per node; every such term is now hoisted into the
    per-call [vocab] built once at the top of [lia_shrink]. *)

Ltac2 head_of (c : constr) : constr :=
  match Constr.Unsafe.kind c with
  | Constr.Unsafe.App f _ => f
  | _ => c
  end.

(** A vocabulary is a set of global heads, split by what kind of global each

    [Constr.Unsafe.kind] and one lookup, independent of the vocabulary size. *)

(** Add the HEAD of a sample term to a vocabulary.

    A sample whose head is neither a constant, an inductive nor a constructor
    is a mistake in the list below rather than a term this filter could ever
    meet, so it is thrown rather than silently ignored -- a silently ignored

(** The arithmetic vocabulary: a hypothesis whose logical skeleton mentions any

    reified hypothesis, a false negative costs a fallback to upstream.

    EVERY ENTRY IS THE HEAD OF A SAMPLE APPLICATION, NEVER A CONSTANT NAME.  The
    two are not the same term: [(0 <= 0)%nat] elaborates to [Peano.le], and
    [Nat.le] is a different constant that no goal in this tree ever carries.  A
    list naming [Nat.le] therefore drops EVERY nat inequality -- including a
    literal [1 <= 0] -- while looking entirely correct, and the fallback hides
    it, because a hypothesis-starved [lia] does not fail fast: at
    ProofCreateMkdir.v:1750 it ran for over 400s without answering.  A wrong
    entry here is a HANG, not a slowdown, so do not hand-write constant names.

(** ONLY A [Prop] IS EVER DROPPED, AND THAT IS NOT AN OPTIMISATION -- IT IS
    WHAT KEEPS THE FILTER FROM CORRUPTING A SIBLING GOAL.

    A hypothesis whose type is not a [Prop] is data: a section variable, a
    typeclass instance ([XI : CurCtx], [GEN : GenId], [riscvGS0]), a ghost name,
    an index.  [lia] cannot read one -- but clearing one RESTRICTS the context of
    every undefined evar that mentions it, and Coq does that silently rather than
    refusing.  The sibling goal then fails to unify long after this tactic
    reported success, naming neither: [rewrite (_ : 2%nat = (1 + 1)%nat); [| lia]]
    at ProofInitlog.v:2293 dies as "Unable to unify ?b with bslots (1 + 1)",
    which reads as a broken rewrite and is a cleared [CurCtx] instance.

    (The tree already knew half of this: the hand-written keep-lists all carry
    [clear - XI Hs] for the same instance, and the note explaining why says the
    error is "a scoping accident". This is that accident's other face.)

    So: keep everything that is not a Prop, and among Props keep the arithmetic
    ones.  Dropping a non-arithmetic Prop is sound -- [zify] cannot read it --
    and a Prop appears in no evar's context, only in its own hypothesis slot.

    A hypothesis of type [False] proves any goal and shares no variable and no
    operator with anything, so keeping it is free; SetShrink records the same
    blind spot.

    Ltac2's [Bool.or] is a FUNCTION, so both its arguments are evaluated: the
    tests are nested as [match]es instead, and [is_prop] -- a retyping call, the
    dearest of the three -- runs only on a hypothesis already headed for the
    doomed list. *)
(** [retype_is_prop] is the honest question, and the dear one: [Constr.type]
    over a whole hypothesis type is ~30 us, and it is asked of every
    non-arithmetic hypothesis.  [is_prop] below asks it of the HEAD instead
    wherever that settles the matter, which is ~9x cheaper (measured: 6.1 ms
    against 0.7 ms over a 203-hypothesis context). *)

(** [codomain n t] — strip [n] leading [Prod]s off [t] and return what is
    under them, or [None] if [t] does not have that many.  What comes back is

(** [is_prop k ty] — is [ty] a [Prop]?

    FALSE MUST MEAN "NOT A PROP", NEVER "DID NOT WORK OUT": a false positive
    clears a non-Prop, which is the silent evar corruption [keeps_for_lia]
    exists to prevent.  A false NEGATIVE only keeps a hypothesis, so every
    inconclusive path here falls back to the retyping.

    The shortcut: if [ty] is [f a1..an] and [f]'s type is [forall x1..xn, s]
    with [s] a SORT, then [s] is closed and no substitution can change it, so
    [ty]'s sort is [s] exactly.  Anything else -- too few [Prod]s (a partial
    application, whose sort is a [Type] anyway), a codomain that is not a

(** [lia_shrink ()] — clear every hypothesis [zify] could not read.

    Unlike [set_shrink] this needs no relevance closure: the criterion is a
    property of the hypothesis alone, so there is nothing to iterate.

    WHAT MAKES THE [clear] WELL-FORMED.  A dropped hypothesis must be named by
    nothing that stays.  Only the GOAL is scanned for that here; a dependency
    from a surviving HYPOTHESIS onto a dropped one -- which needs a
    [Prop]-typed hypothesis to appear in another's type or body, so it is rare
    -- is not looked for, and [SetShrink.clear_greedily] catches it instead by
    bisecting on the failure Coq raises and keeping the halves that do go.
    Scanning every kept type in Ltac2 to predict that answer cost more than
    the whole rest of the filter; see §COST. *)

(** The filtered arms.  No [assert]-isolation wrapper: the sibling-evar hazard
    it was written for is handled at the source by [keeps_for_lia] refusing to

    size for nothing. *)

(** THE SECOND ARM IS LOAD-BEARING.  If the filter drops something [zify] could
    have read, the first arm fails (or, per the header, hangs); the unfiltered
    arm is what keeps this override from turning a provable goal into a failing
    one.  Do not drop it to save a retry.

    THERE IS NO TIMEOUT HERE, AND THERE MUST NOT BE.  The version this replaced
    ran [first [ timeout 1 lia | lia_fast | lia_slow ]] so that a call upstream
    closes in milliseconds never paid for the analysis.  Two things are wrong
    with that.

    It is a WALL-CLOCK reading, so which arm proves a given goal depends on how
    loaded the machine is: the same source can build here and fail there, and a
    timing wobble moves a proof between arms with nothing in the source to
    explain it.  The margin is not comfortable either -- five interleaved
    compiles of ProofBmap.v under the gate ranged over 54.3-59.5 s, so calls
    sitting near one second cross the gate or not depending on the run.

    AND IT DID NOT PAY.  Over two cold full builds of iris/ (1533 files,
    per-file min of the two, all arms sequential on one machine): upstream
    9596 s, gated 9602 s (+0.06%), this ungated filter 9556 s (-0.41%).  The
    gate loses on the arm-count alone -- a [lia] the tree EXPECTS to fail (a
    [try lia], a [first [ lia | ... ]]) runs the decision procedure three times
    under the gate and twice here.  Tree-wide it fired 1568 times, and 1565 of
    those were such a failing call: it rescued three.

    So the gate was hiding a ~60 ms filter, not buying anything.  The filter now
    costs ~6 ms.  If it ever gets expensive again, make it cheap -- do not
    reintroduce a clock. *)

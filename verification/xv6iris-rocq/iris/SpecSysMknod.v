   A TWENTY-slot frame: ra@152 (slot 1), s0@144 (slot 2, the frame
   pointer), the [char path[128]] local in slots 18 down to 3
   ([addi aN,s0,-144]), **the two [int] locals sharing slot 19** -- [minor]
   in its low word at [s0-152], [major] in its high word at [s0-148] --
   and slot 20 unused padding.  As in sys_mkdir, [ip] never leaves a0, so
   no callee-saved register beyond ra and s0 is ever touched.

   ==== ONE CONTRACT ====================================================

   [Module Type SYSMKNOD] is sys_mknod's only seal.  Its body is the
   whole-function FRAME below plus ONE caller INPUT ([mknod_au_at], the
   atomic-update bundle at the path the caller passed) and ONE armed
   OUTPUT ([mknod_arms], keyed on the returned a0).  The landed return blanket [sys_mknod_ret] is a
   consequence of the arms ([mknod_arms_ret]) rather than a second
   conjunct, because the arms already split on the two words a0 can hold.
   A STABLE form is a DERIVED corollary ([wp_sys_mknod_stable_body], proved
   from the seal in ProofSysMknod.v) and never a second proof against the
   code.

   ==== WHAT THE CALLER HANDS IN =======================================

   [mknod_au_pre] is the one-shot bundle of this syscall's linearization
   instants, at the commit mask [appE]:

     - [FsAbsEra.ep_start] AT THE PATH -- nameiparent's PARENT PREFIX
       ([npar_elems pl = removelast (path_elems pl)]: create
       resolves with nameiparent, which fires dirlookup on every element
       but the last, and the LAST element is the created NAME, tied in the
       post by [last (path_elems pl) = Some nm]).  WHICH path is fixed by
       the READING of trapframe argument 0: sys_mknod reads its path out of
       USER memory, and [ArgPath.arg_path_of M pv pl] says the bytes of
       [pl] ARE the calling process's bytes at that pointer, with the NUL
       after them.  So the caller-facing bundle [mknod_au_at] is that
       reading's guarded wand -- one path's worth of walk for a caller that
       knows its own image, which is what a PINNED cursor is -- and the
       success arm's [pl] is tied to the same reading rather than merely
       exposed.  The START is [FsAbsStart.um_start_of cw pl] -- ROOTINO on
       an absolute fetch, the calling process's cwd inum on a relative
       one.
     - [acre_commit_at] -- the success commit, two-phase, fired around the
       parent-row retag at dirlink's successful entry write.
     - [dlookup_commit_at] -- the read-only observation, fired at create's
       own exists-lookup when the name is already there.
     - [cre_child_unfired] -- the child's two legs: the row APPEARS at
       nlink 1, and the unarm fires instead if the parent's entry write
       fails.  THE UNARM IS THE UNDO OF THAT ARM: its inum is the one the
       arm's receipt names ([FsAbsCreateFire.aunarm_of_arm]), which is the
       inum [ialloc] just returned and hence one the view did not have.
       The code never unarms anything else.

   All four are shaped at the AUTHORITY ([FsAbsMknodFire]'s header says why
   an [astate]-shaped commit cannot be discharged against
   [InodeRegion.ftop_body] at all: [abs_view] is not injective, so no
   give-back wand can be paid).

   ==== THE ARMS ========================================================

   ret 0  -- [mknod_post_ok]: create's ARM C-OK read at [T_DEVICE]
             ([SpecCreate.cre_ok_arms_dev]) at the fetched path, under an
             [exists i] beside the region bound create's own post states.  A [ret = 0] is a RECEIPT UNCONDITIONALLY: the era
             walk takes a relative start ([FsAbsStart.ep_start] -- the
             trace deferred in the START INUM), so the proof calls ONE
             create contract for every fetched string and there is no
             absolute-path escape disjunct.  That is what makes the
             theorem say anything about init's "console" and "sh"
             (relative, cwd = ROOTINO).
   ret -1 -- [mknod_post_fail]: nothing fs-visible happened (argstr
             failed) and the whole bundle comes back unspent, or
             create's failure fold read at [T_DEVICE]
             ([SpecCreate.cre_fail_arms_dev]) under an [exists pl] (the
             walk died,
             or create failed at the parent -- either the
             exists-observation fired at a name the parent already held,
             or no abstract observation is available to report).
             DETERMINISM: none is claimed, and none is available.

   ==== THE THREE SYSCALL ARGUMENTS ====================================

   TWO C LOCALS IN ONE FRAME SLOT, AND A HALFWORD READ OUT OF AN [int].
   argint writes a 4-byte cell; the [lh a3,-152(s0)] / [lh a2,-148(s0)] at
   +0x32 / +0x36 then read the LOW HALFWORD of each, because create's
   [short major, short minor] parameters are narrower than the [int]
   locals.  So the walk splits slot 19 into two words
   ([InstrBytes.word_pointsto_split4]) and each word into two halfwords,
   and rejoins on the way to the epilogue.  What reaches the CONTRACT is
   [SysMknodDefs.dev_arg] of the trapframe words -- the low sixteen bits
   read unsigned -- so the caller's receipts speak about the numbers IT
   passed.  What the caller must supply is only that trapframe words
   [tf_arg_idx 0], [1] and [2] exist (argraw's premise, spelled through
   [pv_tf V]).

   BOTH argint RETURN VALUES ARE IGNORED by the C, and [SpecArgint]'s post
   claims nothing about a0, so there is nothing to discard and no arm to
   refute: an out-of-range index would have panicked inside argraw, which
   is why the index premises are [i < NARG] here rather than a branch.

   ==== THE LEDGERS, AND WHAT THEY REST ON ==============================

   Identical to sys_mkdir's, and for identical reasons.  begin_op mints ten
   units, create takes the whole reservation in SET form, end_op retires
   the rest; the [iunlockput(ip)] at +0x46 runs BEFORE end_op and is
   payable only out of create's residue, which is what the [ok = true]
   floor [(iput_units <= u')%nat] in create's post exists for.  This arm is
   the NON-directory one, so it closes with slack
   ([CreateBudget.cr_budget_file]) where sys_mkdir's closes exactly; the
   clause is the same clause.

   The reference ledger is likewise sys_mkdir's: create keeps one slot out
   on success -- its post states that as the equation [S ns' = ns] -- and
   the [iunlockput] hands it back, so every arm ends at [ns].

   ==== WHAT ITS CALLER MUST HOLD ======================================

   create's premise set, unchanged: the printk credential pair ialloc's
   out-of-inodes arm needs, all FOUR superblock cells, and mkfs's inode
   geometry including the [ushort] tie [16 * nib <= 2^16].  [eb = true] is
   create's premise inherited verbatim; the [trap_csrs_ext] /
   [cpu_claim_ext] complement is threaded but is [emp] there.

   THE CROSSING IS THE LITERAL [true]: this function sleeps in begin_op,
   argstr's fault path, create and end_op, so it may return on a hart other
   than the one it was called on.  (The two argint calls do NOT park --
   their own crossing is at [b] -- but the function's is the join of all
   five.)

   THE IMAGE DOES NOT MOVE.  This syscall only READS user memory (argstr,
   through fetchstr and copyinstr); the pages it faults in on the way were
   already in the block's view, as lazy pages reading 0, so vmfault does
   not move it either.  Only the DESCRIPTOR grows, and the block comes back
   at the image it was handed.

   ==== NOTHING ABOUT DURABILITY =======================================

   No durable clause of any kind appears below -- no [flushed], no
   snapshot, no batch (design/fs-syscall-specs.md section 5: durability is
   three GLOBAL principles a consumer applies only at crash points, and the
   per-node certificates live in FsDurSyscall.v).  And nothing about the
   intermediate states create passes through: the child is minted (free
   record -> device record, unreachable orphan) STRICTLY BEFORE the entry
   insert, and that mint is an ordinary state change a concurrent observer
   may see -- which is what the child's two legs make the caller answer
   for.

   BINDERS: one instance path per scope -- [fileG] is bound and
   [icacheG]/[icfg] resolve only through its fields (the SpecCreate
   header's argument, inherited); the FsAbs carriers resolve their
   [fsTopG]/[fsLinkG] through [xv6G]'s fields.  The live Gamma is
   [FsBytesGamma.fs_gamma_L fsc_fs]; its gname tie to [ftop_body]'s
   authority is definitional ([FsAbs.ftop_gamma_top], by reflexivity). *)

(* The client names a chain it holds persistently -- a root [root], the
   path elements [ps] of the directory it expects to create in, and the run
   [ds] of that chain through its own view [avc] -- and its own two
   receipts.  Every FIRED receipt then reports the run AT THE INSTANT.
   Nothing is claimed about the fetched string: see the note at the bottom
   of this file, which is the reason a form keyed on that string is not
   what this one derives.

   NOT A PARAMETER: the path itself.  [ps]/[ds] are the client's CHAIN, and
   [root] is deliberately free -- an absolute expectation instantiates it
   at [FsImg.ROOTINO], a relative one at the cwd's inum, and neither is
   tied to the fetched string by anything (that is the point of the note).
   Note also that [ps = []] -- init's own [mknod("console", 1, 1)] -- is a
   legal instance: the chain is empty, [arun av root [] [root]] holds for
   free, and the corollary degenerates to the AU form with the cursor
   erased.  It is a DEEP path that pays for the pins. *)

(*  THE NOTE: WHY A STABLE FORM KEYED ON THE FETCHED STRING IS NOT        *)
(*  DERIVABLE                                                             *)
(* ===================================================================== *)

(* A stable form could try to key its receipts on the FETCHED STRING --
   "either [path_elems pl = path_elems pl0] and the receipt is at [dpar],
   or it did not match and the receipt is unlocated".  That key is NOT
   DERIVABLE FROM ANY AU FORM OF THIS SHAPE, and the obstruction is
   structural rather than a gap in a proof:

   - The walk's cursor family is the ONLY channel from the syscall's
     interior back to the client, and its members take [(k, d)] -- an index
     and an inum.  The cursor predicate is fixed when the contract is
     instantiated, which is BEFORE the fetched string exists
     ([npar_walk_pre_era] is a one-shot universally quantified over [pl]),
     so no cursor can mention [pl].
   - Therefore the located branch of any match key must be an alternative
     whose OTHER branch is entered when a hop's name misses the client's
     chain -- and what a hop knows at that moment ("this name is not
     [ps !!! k]") is a fact about the fetched string, which the cursor
     cannot record.  Recording it as [emp] makes the disjunction
     [⌜located⌝ ∨ True], which carries nothing.
   - A ghost carried through the cursor does not break the wall either: the
     value it would have to carry is the fetched path, the hops that must
     compare against it are proved BEFORE the one-shot fires (they are
     [⊢]-facts of the cursor), and the arm's own [pl] is bound by a
     DIFFERENT existential from the cursor's -- nothing ties the two.

   So the honest content of a stable mknod is not "the walk was mine" but
   "MY TREE HELD AT THE INSTANT", which is what the form above states and
   what the two [_at_pinned] seeds were landed to buy.  The client is left
   holding the comparison the corollary cannot make for it: the parent inum
   is exposed on the arm, [ds !!! |ps|] is the client's own, and equality
   of the two is decidable where it matters.

   WHAT THE NOTE ASKED FOR IS NOW IN THE AU FORM, and it is exactly the
   USER-MEMORY TIE it names: [ArgPath.arg_path_of] is a premise at a lower
   altitude ([SpecFetchstr]'s "they came from user memory", turned into
   "and these are the bytes"), not a stronger corollary here.  So the AU
   form above IS keyed on the fetched string, while the STABLE corollary is
   not -- deliberately: its client names a CHAIN it holds persistently and
   need not know its own image at all, and the obstruction above is about
   deriving a string key from the cursor family, which is still where the
   cursor cannot go. *)

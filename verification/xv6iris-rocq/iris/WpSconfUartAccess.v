(* WpSconfUartAccess.v -- call-site-specialized S-mode UART device-access leaves
   over the sconf accessor forms.

   These are single-instruction leaf WPs built on the general UART device leaves
   [Uart.wp_lb_uart_s_sconf] / [Uart.wp_sb_uart_s_sconf]: they pre-discharge the
   constant PTE/geometry premises (the caller supplies only that the base
   register already holds the concrete UART register address [uart_pa i off]) and
   package the transmitter-token protocol.  The reuse pattern for any device-MMIO
   S-mode instruction while holding [dev_inv] + the transmitter token:
     - [wp_uart_lsr_read_s_sconf_at]  : LSR poll load (offset 5)
     - [wp_uart_thr_write_s_sconf_at] : THR write (offset 0)

   A functor over UART so a function proof (e.g. UartPutc) instantiates it against
   the sealed [Uart] instance; the leaves live here, out of the whole-function
   proof file. *)

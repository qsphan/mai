   THE DESIGN POINT (see ProcGeom.v's comment on [needs_ctx]/[USED], right
   above [needs_ctx_USED]): [needs_ctx USED = true], not just [needs_ctx
   RUNNABLE] -- "USED is a state a proc can be in with its lock RELEASED:
   kfork drops p->lock after allocproc so it can take wait_lock ... During
   that window any table scan -- wakeup, kill, wait -- can acquire the
   slot's lock, so whatever the slot owns has to be IN the invariant, not
   in kfork's frame.  And the record really is there: allocproc writes
   context.ra = forkret and context.sp = the kstack top, which is exactly
   why kfork can go live with a single store to p->state."

   Consequently [SpecForkretPark.FORKRET_PARK.forkret_park] -- which turns
   allocproc's raw saved context into the real [SchedCtx.proc_ctx] the lock
   invariant demands whenever [needs_ctx st = true] -- has to run ONCE,
   BEFORE THE FIRST release (the one at +0xcc), not at the second: [USED]
   already needs a live parked context, and [RUNNABLE] needs no additional
   one, because [needs_ctx], [not_running] and [inv_dormant] all agree
   between [USED] and [RUNNABLE] (ProcGeom.needs_ctx_USED/_RUNNABLE,
   not_running_USED/_RUNNABLE, inv_dormant_USED/_RUNNABLE).  So the second
   crossing's release is a bare [SchedCtx.proc_slots_recast], and the
   child's [proc_priv] / [fd_slots FDSPARE] are swallowed at the FIRST
   release, not the second.

   MOVE 3 (re-acquiring the child's lock and learning its state): kfork
   never gives up the CLAIMANT's half of the state mirror
   ([ProcGeom.pstate_at_hlf _ USED], split off [pstate_whole] by
   [pstate_whole_split] at the first release and carried, as an ordinary
   ghost resource, straight through the release/wait_lock/re-acquire
   sequence) -- so at the re-acquire, [ProcGeom.pstate_lock_claimed]
   reads [st = USED] off that retained half for free, no table invariant
   or extra premise required.  This is exactly what
   [ProcGeom.pstate_lock_claimed]'s own comment anticipates ("this is what
   lets ... kfork [st = USED], without reading the cell"). *)

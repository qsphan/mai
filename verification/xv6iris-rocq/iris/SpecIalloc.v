   ---- THE CLAIM TAKES NO REGION RESOURCE AND PAYS NONE BACK (§16) -------

   This is the whole point of fs-icache.md §16, and it is what makes [create]
   statable.  ialloc's [log_write] at +0x9a retags the claimed inum's ghost
   fragment -- but ialloc holds NEITHER the itable spinlock nor any entry's
   sleeplock at that moment, so no caller could hand it the fragment and no
   caller could take it back.  What actually serialises two concurrent
   iallocs in xv6 is THE BUFFER (§16.2): [bread] returns the dinode block
   under its sleeplock and the loser's [bread] returns it with the type
   already set.

   Since N5b the model says exactly that.  A free inum's fragment lives in
   the REGION invariant ([InodeRegion.ireg_slot]'s first arm), the claim is
   [InodeRegion.ireg_claim_au] -- an atomic update with NO resource premise
   at all, plugged straight into [SpecLogWrite.wp_log_write_au]'s fupd
   premise at [Efs := ⊤ ∖ ↑iregN] and [Φfsb := True] -- and the retagged
   fragment STAYS in the region, at the [InodeRegion.fresh_shape] arm which
   IS §16.4's claim box.  The first [ilock] of the new inode withdraws it
   there ([InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw], ProofIlock's third fill case).

   So [ireg_inv] rides as the PERSISTENT premise it is, and there is no
   [dinode_at], no [imark] and no [ipool] anywhere in this contract.

   ---- WHAT THE CALLER GETS: iget's POSTCONDITION, VERBATIM --------------

   ialloc's last act is [return iget(dev, inum)] at +0xaa, so the success
   arm's payout is [SpecIget]'s: a slot [kslot < NINODE], a fraction [q],
   [a0 = ientry kslot], and ONE [IcacheRef.inode_ref kslot q icfg_dev inum].
   The inum is existential -- the scan finds it -- and its region bound
   [bv_unsigned inum < 16 * icfg_nib] travels with it, which is what lets a
   caller rebuild [IcacheHeld.inode_held] outright.  Until rank 1c the device
   and the inode count were THREADED and the caller had to bring
   [dev = icfg_dev] / [nib = icfg_nib]; there is one file system and one
   device, so both are read off the class now and the two ties are gone.

   The claimed record is named too, as [ialloc_fresh ty] -- nonzero type,
   zero size, thirteen zero address words, and NOTHING ELSE, because the
   memset+[sh] pair writes nothing else.  In particular NLINK STAYS 0 until
   the caller's own [iupdate]; that is [InodeRegion.fresh_shape]'s exact
   content and it is all ilock's fill needs to build [InodeLock.inode_ok]
   out of nothing.  The fact is stated for documentation and for [create]'s
   benefit; it is not a resource, and it says nothing about the region's
   state at RETURN time -- by then another hart may already have locked the
   new inode.

   ---- THE THREE GEOMETRY PREMISES --------------------------------------

   [1 < ninodes] kills the [bgeu a5,a4] at +0x12, the EMPTY-REGION exit that
   jumps to the printk WITHOUT having pushed s1..s6 -- balloc's [0 < size]
   premise, at the same instruction offset, killing the same arm for the
   same reason (a second epilogue shape, not a second behaviour).

   [ninodes <= 16 * nib] is the SUPERBLOCK-TO-REGION tie, and it is the
   premise that did not exist before this contract: the scan's bound comes
   out of [sb.ninodes] while both [ireg_claim_au] and [iget] want
   [bv_unsigned inum < 16 * nib].  It belongs to the boot layer (SpecFsinit
   is where the superblock cells are born, N5a's ledger) and is threaded
   here, not discharged.

   [ninodes < 2 ^ 31] is what makes the [lw]-then-[bltu] comparison at
   +0x5a..+0x62 numeric: the loaded word is sign-extended into a 64-bit
   register and compared UNSIGNED against the likewise sign-extended
   [addiw a5,s2,0].

   ialloc SLEEPS (bread), so it threads the full running-process bundle
   exactly as SpecIupdate.v / SpecBalloc.v do, and takes the parking
   premise.  It enters and returns at noff 0.                             *)

            Why the claim flavour.  ialloc's iget is the one call in the

            a claim box" -- true (RULING C', iclaim-ledger.md §5''''').

            Why the [c] fragment is exposed at all: it is the ONLY licence a
            fresh claim box has (ClaimL, §2.6's fourth row), and create's
            [ilock(ip)] spends it at [InodeRegion.ireg_withdraw], whose

            which is also what retires [c] so that [ireg_freeze_au] can
            refute a standing claim at all.

            create's fill presents the package to ilock in ONE destruct, by
            [InodeRegion.inode_claimed_to_ClaimK]: what sits beside the

   [CreateBudget]'s arm theorems consume [ia_spend = 1] against a

   can have logged it.  fs-sysfile S5a's retrofit table says exactly this
   ("the inum is the scan's, so no credit is possible and the spend is
   unconditional"), which is why the growth is stated as the determinate

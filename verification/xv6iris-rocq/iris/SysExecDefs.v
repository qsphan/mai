(* SysExecDefs.v -- sys_exec()'s VOCABULARY LEAF: the frame budget
   [K_sys_exec] and the RESULT RELATION [sys_exec_post], stated
   independently of any proof.

   THE CONTRACT ITSELF IS [SpecSysExec.SYSEXEC] ([wp_sys_exec_sconf]),
   above this file: sys_exec has ONE contract -- kexec's bundle and arms
   lifted to the syscall boundary
   (fs-syscall-specs.md, "ONE CONTRACT PER SYSCALL").  Its frame is the
   premise list this header describes row for row, and its armed post
   implies the [sys_exec_post] below
   ([SpecSysExec.sys_exec_arms_landed]).

     uint64 sys_exec(void) {
       char path[MAXPATH], *argv[MAXARG];
       int i;
       uint64 uargv, uarg;

       argaddr(1, &uargv);
       if (argstr(0, path, MAXPATH) < 0) return -1;
       memset(argv, 0, sizeof(argv));
       for (i = 0;; i++) {
         if (i >= NELEM(argv))                                    goto bad;
         if (fetchaddr(uargv + sizeof(uint64)*i, &uarg) < 0)       goto bad;
         if (uarg == 0) { argv[i] = 0; break; }
         if ((argv[i] = kalloc()) == 0)                            goto bad;
         if (fetchstr(uarg, argv[i], PGSIZE) < 0)                  goto bad;
       }
       int ret = kexec(path, argv);
       for (i = 0; i < NELEM(argv) && argv[i] != 0; i++) kfree(argv[i]);
       return ret;
      bad:

   @ KernelSyms.sys_exec, 101 instructions / 268 bytes, a 480-byte frame.
   The LAST function of the exec cone and the last of sysfile.c.

   ---- WHAT IT IS FOR --------------------------------------------------

   sys_exec exists to MARSHAL: it turns two user words in the trapframe
   into exactly the resources [SpecKexec.wp_kexec_frame] demands, and it
   is the only caller kexec has.  Read the two contracts together -- almost
   every premise of the contract above is one of kexec's, paid here:

   * kexec wants the PATH as [S plen] owned bytes with [bb_cstr pfun plen].
     [argstr] copies the user string into this function's own
     [char path[MAXPATH]] and reports [fetchstr_ret], which is exactly that
     (or -1, and then kexec is never called).  It reports one thing more,
     [SpecFetchstr.fetchstr_got]: those bytes ARE the process's own at
     trapframe argument 0, which is what lets this level owe the exec
     bundle at the single path the caller passed
     ([SpecSysExec.exec_path_of]) instead of at every string of the right
     shape.
   * kexec wants each ARGUMENT as a NUL-terminated string of [alen i]
     characters inside [aslen i] owned bytes with [alen i < 4096].
     [kalloc] gives a whole page and [fetchstr] fills it with [max = PGSIZE],
     so [aslen i = 4096] and [alen i < 4096] -- kexec's blocker-§7 premise,
     paid for free.
   * kexec wants the ARGV VECTOR as [S na] owned words ending in a NULL.
     That is this function's own [char *argv[MAXARG]] frame array, memset to
     zero and then filled; the [break] arm writes the terminating NULL.
     [fetchaddr] reports one thing more about each user pointer it read,
     [SpecFetchaddr.fetchaddr_got]: that word IS the process's own at
     [uargv + 8i].  Together with each [fetchstr]'s content clause and the
     NULL the break tested, that is what lets this level owe the exec
     bundle at the single vector the caller passed
     ([SpecSysExec.exec_args_of]) instead of at every vector of the right
     shape.
   * kexec wants [na < MAXARG].  The loop tests [i != 32] on its BACK EDGE,
     so it reaches the break with [i < 32] -- see the note on the off-by-one
     below, which is why the premise is [<] and not [<=].

   ---- THE ONE THING THAT HAD TO MOVE FIRST ----------------------------

   kexec used to carry a log-budget premise, [(L+1) * iput_units +
   iput_units <= MAXOPBLOCKS], admitting only single-element paths.  sys_exec
   cannot pay it and no caller ever could: the path arrives through [argstr],
   so its contents -- and hence [L] -- are EXISTENTIAL.  The premise is gone,
   priced instead through [SpecNamei.wp_namei_gen] over [LogInv.log_opS],
   whose [SpecNamex.walk_need] is 4 whatever the depth; KexecDefs.v's header
   has the story.  Without that, this contract does not exist.

   ---- WHAT THE POSTCONDITION SAYS -------------------------------------

   [kexec_ok] VERBATIM, against the block the copy-ins left behind.  There
   is nothing sys_exec can add to it and nothing it should drop:

   * the page table may have GROWN before kexec ran -- [argstr] and each
     [fetchstr] fault user pages in -- so the block kexec is called with is
     [upd_upt V P'], and [uptd_ext (pv_upt V) P'] is what the copy-ins
     report.  (kexec's own copyouts may grow it further; that is inside
     [kexec_ok]'s success arm.)
   * on every path that does NOT reach kexec -- argstr failed, fetchaddr
     failed, kalloc returned 0, fetchstr failed, or the loop ran out of
     argv slots -- the return is -1 and the block is handed back UNCHANGED
     at [upd_upt V P'].  That is [kexec_ok]'s failure arm exactly, so those
     five paths and kexec's own eight [bad:] entries are one disjunct.
   * [na], [alen], [entry], [spv] and [szv'] are existential: they are
     functions of user memory, which no caller of this contract names.

   THE KALLOC'D PAGES DO NOT APPEAR, in the contract or in its result.
   Every page the loop allocates is freed by one of the two [kfree] loops
   before the function returns -- including on the success path, after
   kexec has copied the strings out -- so the allocator is left exactly as
   it was found and [kalloc_env] is the only thing that crosses.  That is
   also why there is no page-count premise: the loop allocates at most
   MAXARG pages and gives every one of them back.

   ---- THE OFF-BY-ONE THE C HAS, AND WHERE IT IS RULED OUT --------------

   The C tests [i >= NELEM(argv)] at the TOP of the loop body, but gcc
   compiles it as the loop's back-edge test ([bne s2,s7] at +0x8e), so the
   break at [uarg == 0] is reached with [i < 32] and the [argv[i] = 0] store
   is in range.  What is NOT in range is kexec's own [ustack[argc] = 0] at
   exactly [argc = 32], which is why kexec takes [na < MAXARG] rather than
   [na <= MAXARG] -- and this function is where that premise is discharged,
   from the same back-edge test.  claude-notes/kernel-defects.md has the
   C-level story. *)

(* [KexecDefs] for [kexec_ok] and [fs_fabric].  This contract is a CALLER of
   kexec -- its whole job is to build kexec's precondition -- so requiring
   kexec's Spec is not the cross-function reach the tree's rule warns about;
   the two are designed against each other.  It also makes this the second
   consumer of [fs_fabric], which per the promote-on-second-consumer rule
   would move it to a shared [FsFabric.v]; not done, because the second
   consumer is kexec's own caller rather than an independent stater, so

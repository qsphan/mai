(* SpecUartinitone.v -- the public interface of Uartinitone, stated
   independently of its proof.  Requires only the definitional layer -- never
   a whole-function proof file -- so every function proof can be checked in
   parallel.

   [uartinitone(struct uart *u, char *name)] is the 16550 device-init routine
   at ONE port (kernel/uart.c at XV6_REV 163d39b); [uartinit] is now nothing
   but two calls to it, one per element of [uarts[]].  It runs in S-mode
   during boot.  The seven MMIO byte writes are, in order (all through the
   base [u->base] the .data word holds, i.e. [uart_pa i off]):

     off 1 = 0x00   disable interrupts (IER)
     off 3 = 0x80   set DLAB (LCR_BAUD_LATCH)
     off 0 = 0x03   LSB divisor       (DLL, DLAB set)
     off 1 = 0x00   MSB divisor       (DLM, DLAB set)
     off 3 = 0x03   8N1, clear DLAB   (LCR_EIGHT_BITS)
     off 2 = 0x07   enable + clear both FIFOs (FCR)
     off 1 = 2|rx   enable tx interrupts, and rx interrupts iff [u->rx] != 0

   then [initlock(&u->tx_lock, name)].

   THREE THINGS ARE NEW RELATIVE TO THE OLD SINGLE-PORT [uartinit].

   (1) THE MMIO BASE IS LOADED, NOT A CONSTANT.  Every [WriteReg(u, …)]
   begins [ld a5,0(a0)], so the address the store leaf sees comes out of the
   .data word [uarts[i].base].  [SpecUartPutc.uart_base_word i] is the
   persistent snapshot of that word at the value [uart_base i], minted once
   in the boot chain, and it is what turns the loaded register into
   [uart_pa i 0].  Without it nothing in the proof knows which device
   the stores reach -- and since eight harts share the array, a persistent
   snapshot is the only honest resource for it.

   (2) THE SEVENTH WRITE READS [u->rx].  [IER <- IER_TX_ENABLE | (u->rx ?
   IER_RX_ENABLE : 0)] compiles to [ld a5,8(a0); snez a5,a5; addi a5,a5,2],
   so the byte is 3 at the console (whose [rx] is [consoleintr]) and 2 at the
   port with nowhere for input to go.  [UartsFields.uart_rx_pinned i] is what
   decides which: it pins the .data word to [uart_rx_hook i].  The contract
   does NOT name the resulting byte -- the ghost step for offset 1 is stable
   at either value ([uart_write_1_stable]) -- but the proof needs the word to
   be able to run the [snez] at all.

   (3) THE LOCK'S NAME IS AN ARGUMENT.  [initlock(&u->tx_lock, name)] takes
   the caller's string, so this contract is parametric in [nm : string] and
   in the [.rodata] address the caller put in a1.  [uartinit] instantiates it
   at "uart0" and "uart1"; nothing here decides the port's name.

   EVERYTHING ELSE IS THE OLD CONTRACT, INDEXED BY THE PORT.  In particular
   it is still STATED OVER THE TIME-0 DEVICE INVARIANT -- device init does
   NOT run before [uart_inv i] is allocated: the UART thread is a top-level
   thread from step 0 and every one of its steps needs the fragment, so
   [uart_frag] can never sit raw in a CPU's precondition -- and the two
   writes that look incompatible with an invariant are both discharged by
   ghost arithmetic rather than by running early:

     - the FCR FIFO-CLEAR (off 2, bit 2) discards queued bytes, which a
       [mono_list] over [uart_acc] cannot do -- unless the FIFO is provably
       empty.  It is: the caller's [uart_tx_own γ l] pins [uart_acc u = l]
       and [uart_out_lb γ l] says the transmitted prefix has already reached
       [l], so [DevModel.uart_tx_empty_of_out] leaves nothing in [u_tx] and
       the clear shrinks nothing.
     - the DLAB SET (off 3 = 0x80) is why the caller threads the UNFROZEN
       half [uart_dlab_is γ (DfracOwn (1/2)) b0] at an ARBITRARY [b0] rather
       than the persistent [uart_dlab_off]: the freeze happens in this
       function's tail, where the final LCR write has just cleared DLAB.  So
       [uart_dlab_off] is uartinitone's OUTPUT.

   AND IT IS THE SAME CONTRACT AT BOTH PORTS.  The owner's ruling for this
   bump is that UART1's OUTPUT is unconstrained -- nothing tracks what
   printk/panic put on that wire -- but that is a statement about who
   CONSUMES [uart_sent]; the port still needs its FIFO and DLAB ghosts to
   exist, because the FCR clear and the baud-latch dance are the same seven
   instructions at both ports.  So the ghosts are threaded uniformly and the
   second port's caller simply drops the trace claims it is handed back.

   uartinitone writes no THR, so the accepted trace is unchanged and the
   token and receipt come back at the same [l]. *)

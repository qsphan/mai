(* WHAT THE HOST RECEIVED ON EACH PORT, in the same currency vtest.py
   captures from QEMU's serial backends: [u_wire], the bytes that actually
   left that port on SOUT.  NOT [uart_acc] ([u_out ++ u_tx], every byte the
   device has ACCEPTED), which is the transmitter's business and not the
   host's -- under LOOPBACK an accepted byte goes to this UART's own
   receiver and the host never sees it, which is exactly what UartLoop.v
   checks.  The two agree on every other test: [VSched.settle] drains every
   port's FIFO after every instruction, so nothing is left in flight when
   the guest publishes its result.

   ONE ENTRY PER PORT, IN [enum uart_id] ORDER, AND ALWAYS ALL OF THEM.
   The machine has two 16550s, the runner captures both backends, and this
   says what BOTH wires hold -- so a byte the model put on the wrong port
   makes the comparison FAIL rather than going unlooked-at.  A test that
   drives one port still pins the other's wire as empty. *)

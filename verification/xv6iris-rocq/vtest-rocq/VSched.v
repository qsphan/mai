   instruction, so this is the harness's hot path. *)
(* [latch] SAYS WHETHER THE GATEWAY ARMS MAY BE TAKEN, and it exists because
   [settle] is HARNESS MACHINERY, not the model's transition relation.  A
   device step is an OPTIONAL transition: the relation permits taking it or
   not at any moment.  [settle] takes every enabled arm, which is a fine
   default and the only one every other test wants -- but it means the
   harness cannot reach executions the model HAS.

   [plic_level] is the case that needs the difference.  The model's gateway
   re-forwards a still-asserted level the instant [plic_complete] clears the
   claimed bit, so one device request yields a second interrupt; QEMU's
   pending bit comes off the RISING EDGE only, so it stays down.  The model
   is the one that is right -- a re-forwarding level gateway is why a driver
   acknowledges the DEVICE before completing at the PLIC -- and the model
   also has an execution matching QEMU, namely the one that does not take
   [SLatch] again.  Eager settling could not express it, so the run read as
   a mismatch when what it really showed was a gap in the harness.

   EVERY EXISTING CALLER IS UNCHANGED: [settle1_at] and [settle] pass
   [true], which is the body this had before. *)

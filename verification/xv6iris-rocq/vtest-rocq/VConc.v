(* 1. The machine.  Every hart lands where its own boot chain leaves it --  *)
(*    [ColdBoot.cold_regs] is parametric in the hart id, and the id is the  *)
(*    only thing the chain does with it (it stores it and copies it into    *)
(*    a0), which is what makes `csrr mhartid` the right way for a test      *)
(*    program to tell the harts apart.                                     *)
(* ---------------------------------------------------------------------- *)

(* [base] IS THE FIRST HART'S mhartid, and it is not always 0.

   A board image is built with PRIMARY_HART=<n> and computes its slot as
   `mhartid - n`, because the JH7110's hart 0 is the E24 and hart 1 runs
   firmware -- so its multi-hart tests run on harts 2 and 3.  Starting the
   model at mhartid 0 and 1 gives those images slots -2 and -1: NOBODY takes
   the primary path, _vtest_body never runs, DONE is never set, and the run
   burns its whole budget executing a program that cannot work.  Measured:
   conc_smoke's board run spent 162 s doing exactly that and came back with
   an empty observation, which reads as a mismatch and is nothing of the
   kind.  Every multi-hart board run had the same defect.

   The CPU INDEX is just a slot in [gregs]; what the program sees is the
   mhartid the cold state carries.  So the fix is here rather than in
   [cfinish] or in the hand-written schedules, which go on naming hart0 and
   hart1 and mean "the first and second hart of this run". *)

   IT IS NOT [v_disk = disk_of_sectors o_disk], and that is not a

   UNPROVABLE here: the model's disk is a closure the drain built, and

   relates two functions that agree everywhere.  Measured, four runs --
   disk_err, disk_intr, plic_arb, plic_tie -- agree with their capture on
   every byte of every sector it recorded and could still not be proved.  A
   list equality can be, and says what was actually measured.

     input" is what would be proved, which for a receiving test is no check
     at all.  The UART is the only input a test has; when there is another
     it gets its own field rather than being folded in here.

     BYTES, not [Z].  What the host types is a byte, and saying so is what
     makes [obs_in] of a delivered input the identity rather than the
     identity-on-values-that-happen-to-fit; the alternative is a range side
     condition on the theorem, which would be the same fact written where
     it cannot be checked.

     TAGGED WITH THE PORT, because there are two of them and a byte
     arriving at the other one is a DIFFERENT input.  [ObsUartIn] carries
     the port for the same reason, so [obs_in] still reads the trace back
     exactly and the theorem still pins what was typed and where. *)

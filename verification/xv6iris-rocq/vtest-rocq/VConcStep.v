(* THE PREMISE IS A CONJUNCTION HERE AND A BOOLEAN IN [VExecStep], and the
   difference is measured, not stylistic.  The single-hart run's boolean
   form is 1.7x faster (core_smoke 5.0s -> 2.9s): the tactic computes
   nothing and the kernel checks once instead of twice.  The MULTI-HART
   run's is 25x SLOWER (conc_smoke 7s -> over 180s), because a [cstate]
   carries the write log and the per-hart coherence maps -- and the
   coherence map is a NEST OF CLOSURES, one per plain read.  Reducing a
   boolean forces the whole record to a value, closures and all;
   [vm_compute] then [repeat split] forces only the three fields the
   equations mention.  So this one keeps the conjunction. *)

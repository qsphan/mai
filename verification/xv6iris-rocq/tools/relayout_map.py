"""Re-point a hand-written proof at the new image after a kernel relayout.

An image relayout re-encodes every pc-relative immediate (jal/branch targets,
auipc/addi data pairs), so a proof that SPELLS one -- and every whole-function
proof spells each of them, typically twice per call site -- is now wrong.  The
generated `iris/Code<F>.v` files are the ground truth: they are regenerated
from the dump by tools/gen_code.py, so their git diff IS the map.

    map   : print the per-offset old -> new immediate changes for a Code file
    apply : rewrite a proof file with that map

`apply` works the way durable-notes.md's playbook prescribes -- keyed by
LEMMA OFFSET rather than by value.  It scans the proof linearly, tracking the
most recent `KernelSyms.<sym> + 0x<off>` anchor, and inside each anchored
region rewrites only the immediates that moved AT THAT OFFSET OR AT OFFSET+4.
That is what makes it safe where a global value substitution is not: the same
number means different things at different offsets, adjacent call sites
collide, and some proofs write the immediate in hex and others in decimal.

WHAT THE MAP CANNOT SEE, and the one way it could corrupt a proof: it compares
old against new AT THE SAME OFFSET.  That is exact only while the two images
agree on where instructions START.  As soon as a function gains or loses an
instruction, every offset above that point names a DIFFERENT instruction in
the two images, and comparing them is comparing two unrelated things.  Usually
that shows up as a shape change and is reported; but when the two unrelated
instructions happen to share a shape, the difference looks exactly like an
ordinary moved immediate, and substituting it splices a stranger's immediate
into the proof.  It still typechecks as an immediate, so nothing downstream
catches it.  (Real case: on CodeKexec.v phase C gained instructions at +0x23c,
and the map proposed rewriting phase B's tail at +0x318 -- `ld s6,480(sp)` /
`j +0x64` -- with phase D's `ld s11,440(sp)` / `j +0x72`.  Both `ldsp`+`cj`.)

So once a symbol has ANY reshaped offset, every change at or above the LOWEST
one is quarantined into the reshape report as UNTRUSTED, and `apply` cannot
reach it; below the first reshape the offsets still line up and the changes
stay usable.  This also closes a narrower hole: an offset reported as
REGISTERS REALLOCATED used to have its IMMEDIATES substituted anyway.

THE +4 IS NOT SLOP, it is the auipc/I-type pair.  A "reloc lemma" states the
address an `auipc`/`addi` pair computes, so it ANCHORS on the auipc
(`KernelSyms.f + 0x0c`) while spelling the immediate of the addi at `+0x10`.
Keying strictly on the anchor skipped every one of those, silently -- three
separate relayout batches caught them only via `residue` and fixed ~25 by
hand.  Substitution is single-pass for the same reason: with two offsets'
maps merged, sequential replacement could CHAIN (100->200 then 200->300
yielding 100->300).  A literal the two maps disagree about is left alone for
`residue` to report as AMBIGUOUS.

Usage:
    relayout_map.py map   CodeBalloc.v
    relayout_map.py apply CodeBalloc.v ProofBalloc.v [--write]
    relayout_map.py residue CodeBalloc.v ProofBalloc.v   (MANDATORY post-step)

Without --write, `apply` prints a unified diff and changes nothing.

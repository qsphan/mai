"""relayout_shift.py -- the SHIFT-AWARE relayout map.  Use this one whenever a
function GAINED OR LOST an instruction; use relayout_map.py when it only moved.

WHY BOTH EXIST.  relayout_map.py compares the old and new images AT THE SAME
OFFSET.  That is exact while both agree on where instructions start, and it is
what you want for a pure relayout.  The moment a function gains an instruction
every later offset names a DIFFERENT instruction in the two images, and the
comparison is between two unrelated things:

  * usually that shows up as a shape change, and relayout_map.py quarantines
    everything at or above the first one (it has to -- it cannot tell which
    of the two instructions is "the same" one);
  * occasionally the two unrelated instructions share a shape, and then the
    difference looks exactly like a moved immediate.  On CodeKexec.v that
    proposed rewriting phase B's tail (`ld s6,480(sp)` / `j +0x64`) with phase
    D's `ld s11,440(sp)` / `j +0x72`.  Both `ldsp`+`cj`; it typechecks.

So on a reshaped function relayout_map.py is SAFE but nearly useless: on
CodeVmfault.v it calls 48 of 55 offsets reshaped and can apply almost nothing.

WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD.  It ALIGNS the two instruction streams with difflib
over NUMBER-NORMALISED ASTs -- so an immediate-only or register-only change
still aligns, and only a genuine insertion or deletion falls out of the
alignment.  From the alignment it derives:

  offmap     old offset -> new offset   (the shift, per instruction)
  immmap     the non-register immediates that really changed, per aligned pair
  regmap     register-field changes -- REPORTED, never applied, same rule as
             relayout_map.py: a moved register means gcc recompiled the
             function and the proof needs a human
  UNALIGNED  the inserted/deleted instructions themselves

THE `UNALIGNED` LIST IS THE MOST USEFUL OUTPUT, BUT IT IS NECESSARY AND NOT
SUFFICIENT: it should be exactly the instructions the C change added or
removed, and if it is bigger than that the alignment is wrong and nothing else
here should be trusted -- but it can also look exactly right and BE wrong.
Alignment is on NUMBER-NORMALISED ASTs, so when the new code duplicates a shape
already present, difflib can pair the wrong copy.  On `namex` (03e5422a) the
new bail block is `mv a0,s4 ; jal iunlockput` and the pre-existing `L_par` arm
is `mv a0,s4 ; jal iunlock` -- identical with the numbers blanked.  difflib
matched them, so 0x7a/0x7c mapped to THEMSELVES instead of +0x84/+0x86 and the
map proposed rewriting `L_par`'s `jal iunlock` into `jal iunlockput`, a
well-typed immediate nothing downstream would catch -- while UNALIGNED showed
exactly the 6 entries the C change predicted.  So on such a function, check the
SHIFT MAP against the disassembly too; the cheap tell is an offset that maps to
itself inside a range where everything around it moved.  On the psz bump it was 1 entry for kwait, 2 for sys_pipe
(two copyout call sites), 1 for filestat -- and on vmfault it printed, with no
help, precisely the semantic diff: the deleted `jal myproc`, the deleted
`ld a5,72(a0)` (p->sz), the deleted `ld a0,80(s1)` (p->pagetable) and the
inserted `li s4,0`.

It also caught something the same-offset view actively MISREPORTS: filestat's
epilogue shifts by +4, not the +2 it appears to, because old 0x4e/0x50 were
already `ld s2`/`ld s3`.  "The epilogue grew a saved register" was an artifact.

`apply` rewrites anchored immediates, remaps the ANCHOR OFFSETS themselves
(which relayout_map.py never has to do), and renumbers `Code<F>.v` lemma
names, single-pass.

TWO KNOWN GAPS, both wanting a human afterwards:
  * it does not rewrite an immediate on a continuation line whose anchor is
    several lines back (fix those by hand; `residue` in relayout_map.py still
    finds them);
  * hypothesis-name renumbering is NOT done, and cannot be done naively --
    prefixes like `Hrga5` mix a register name with an offset.

Usage:
    relayout_shift.py CodeVmfault.v vmfault
    relayout_shift.py CodeKwait.v kwait --proof ProofKwait.v --prefix kwi [--alias KW] [--write]

ALWAYS finish with `relayout_map.py residue <Code> <Proof> [ALIAS...]`.

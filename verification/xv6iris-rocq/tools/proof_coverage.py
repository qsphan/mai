"""Report which xv6 kernel functions have a proven Iris/Rocq spec.

The report is hierarchical: one section per xv6 source file (``proc.c``,
``vm.c``, ``trampoline.S``, ...), listing that file's functions and, for each,
whether the proofs under ``iris/`` establish something about it.

WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM
-------------------------

Three independent sources are joined on the *symbol name*:

1. ``kernel-rocq/KernelSyms.v`` -- the symbol table of the exact kernel image
   the proofs are about (addresses).  This, not a freshly built ELF, is the
   ground truth: ``xv6-riscv/kernel/`` is an untracked build tree that may have
   drifted from the image the proofs were generated against.

2. ``kernel-rocq/KernelInstrs.v`` -- every instruction of that image.  A symbol
   is a *function* iff an instruction starts at its address; a function's byte
   size is the instruction bytes from its entry up to the next function entry.
   So sizes and the function list are self-contained in the tracked artifacts.

3. ``xv6-riscv/kernel/*.o`` (via ``nm``) -- which source file defines each
   symbol.  Only names are read, never addresses, so a stale build tree still
   attributes correctly.  Falls back to scanning ``*.c`` / ``*.S`` for a
   definition or label when the objects are absent.

The proof side is read from the files ``iris/_CoqProject`` lists -- the build's
own target list -- and NOT from a ``iris/*.v`` glob.  A ``.v`` in the tree but
absent from the project file is compiled by nobody, so a "proven" function read
out of it would be a claim no build has ever checked; keying off ``_CoqProject``
makes the report describe exactly what CI verifies.  Drift either way is a
``--check`` error, never a silent adjustment -- with one declared exception, a
row commented out to a bare ``# Foo.v`` (see ``coqproject_files``).

WHAT COUNTS AS "PROVEN"
-----------------------

Most whole-function proofs are in the spec-module shape (see
``claude-notes/design/spec-modules.md``): ``Spec<F>.v`` states a ``Module Type``
over a ``wp_<f>_..._body`` definition, ``Wp<F>.v`` proves it as a sealed
functor, and ``Link<F>.v`` applies that functor to its callees' proofs.  Those
are discovered automatically:

* a ``_body`` definition whose *entry* ``pc_is`` is ``KernelSyms.<sym>`` at
  offset 0 **and** whose continuation ``pc_is`` is the caller's return address
  (a ``let`` bound from register x1 / ``ra``, whatever it is named) is a
  WHOLE-FUNCTION spec for ``<sym>``.  Either pin may be FACTORED into a
  same-file predicate the body applies rather than written inline -- the
  atomic-update specs put both in a shared ``_frame`` (``SysOpenDefs.v``),
  and several older specs factor just the continuation -- so both are followed
  through the application (``entry_via_frame`` / ``runs_to_end``);
* the same with a nonzero entry offset, or with a continuation that is another
  address inside the function, is a FRAGMENT spec (prologue / loop / epilogue);
* the spec is PROVEN if some ``Module <F>Proof ... : <MODTYPE>`` implements it
  and some ``Link*.v`` instantiates that functor; otherwise it is only
  ASSUMED (an interface nobody has discharged).

A handful of whole-function proofs predate that shape (the M-mode boot path and
the hand-written assembly: ``_entry``, ``start``, ``timerinit``, ``swtch``,
``kernelvec``, ``userret``, ...).  They name their entry pc through a local
``Definition``, which no textual rule can follow reliably, so they are declared
in MANIFEST below -- and every declaration is *verified* against the tree
(file exists, lemma is there), so it cannot rot silently.

Functions with neither are still reported as PARTIAL if any proof file mentions
an address inside them, which is what work-in-progress looks like.

HONESTY
-------

``Admitted.`` inside an implementing module, and ``Axiom``s reachable through a
proof's ``Require`` closure, are collected and propagated along the functor
dependency graph, so a function proved over an admitted callee is flagged.
This is a static over-approximation of ``Print Assumptions``; it needs no build.

def coqproject_files(repo: str):
    """-> ([path, ...], [error, ...]) -- the file list the BUILD compiles.

    Keyed off ``iris/_CoqProject``, not a ``*.v`` glob, because that list is
    what ``coq_makefile`` turns into the build's targets.  A ``.v`` sitting in
    the tree unlisted is never compiled by anyone, so a "proven" function read
    out of it would be a claim no build has ever checked -- green CI over an
    unverified proof, silent in both directions.  Keying off the project file
    makes that impossible by construction: the report can only describe files
    the build checks.

    Both kinds of drift are returned as errors rather than quietly resolved,
    since each is a real defect, and ``--check`` turns them into a failing step:
    an unlisted file is an unchecked proof, and a listed-but-absent one breaks
    the build outright.  Assumes the flat ``iris/*.v`` layout the report handles
    (no subdirectories); a subdirectory entry would surface as "does not exist".

    ONE OMISSION IS LEGITIMATE, AND IT DECLARES ITSELF: a row commented out to
    a bare ``# Foo.v``.  A file can be deliberately outside the coq_makefile
    build and still on disk, for either of two reasons:

    * it is compiled by NOBODY -- a descoped tier kept for a later revival, a
      retired proof kept as provenance;
    * it is compiled by SOMETHING ELSE -- ``iris/SystemAssumptions.v``, the
      ``Print Assumptions`` audit, which ``make audit`` builds and CI runs
      after the build.  It is out of the project file because putting it in
      costs ~30 % of a clean build's wall clock on the serial tail, not
      because nobody checks it.

    Either way the honest place to record it is the project file itself, beside
    the rows it sits among, where the next reader looks.  So a bare commented
    filename exempts that file from the unlisted error; anything else in a
    comment (the prose explaining the block, an option line) is not a filename
    and is ignored as before.  The guarantee this check exists for is untouched
    in both cases, because such a file is not returned to the caller either --
    it is not a coq_makefile target, so nothing it claims is counted here, which
    is exactly why the second kind must carry no coverage claims.  What the
    check still catches is the *accident* -- a file added to ``iris/`` and
    forgotten -- and it also catches a commented row that has gone stale, since
    a ``# Foo.v`` naming a file that no longer exists points at a row that
    cannot come back.

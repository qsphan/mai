"""relayout_batch.py -- drive relayout_map.py over the whole tree after a bump.

A pure-relayout bump re-encodes a pc-relative immediate in nearly every
function, so the per-file `relayout_map.py apply` has to run ~100 times against
~200 hand-written proof files.  This pairs them up automatically:

  * a Code<F>.v whose git diff carries immediate changes is a SOURCE;
  * every hand-written .v that ANCHORS on one of that file's symbols is a
    TARGET -- see targets_for for why "names the Code module" is the obvious
    rule and the wrong one;
  * aliases are collected from the target AND FROM THE FILES IT REQUIRES.
    relayout_map.find_aliases only reads the file it rewrites, but a proof
    split across `Proof<F>.v` / `Proof<F>Parts.v` declares the alias in the
    Parts file (`Notation FC := KernelSyms.fileclose`) and uses it in the
    other -- so the scan never re-anchors there and `apply` reports a
    truthful-looking "0 substitutions" over a file it left stale.  The alias
    table CANNOT be global: `KX` is `kexec` in one proof family and `kexit`
    in another, so it is resolved per target through that target's imports.

It refuses to run when any source reports a SHAPE change (`reshaped`), because
then the map is quarantined and a human has to classify the function first --
see claude-notes/xv6-bump-playbook.md §2.  `--allow-shape=Code<F>.v` records
that classification: the file stops blocking the run, and the batch prints the
targets that anchor on its symbols so you can see what the quarantined map
would reach.  Zero targets is the common case (the reshaped function has no
proof) and is the only case where the flag is free.

    relayout_batch.py            # dry run: what would change, per file
    relayout_batch.py --write    # do it
    relayout_batch.py --residue  # the MANDATORY post-step, over every pair
    relayout_batch.py --skip=CodePanic.v   # drop a source whose proof is hand-rewritten

"""instr_subgoal.py -- convert a proof from POSING instruction facts to closing
them as subgoals.

The discipline (claude-notes/projects/instr-subgoal-sweep.md): a leaf lemma's
[instr pc rvc ast] premise never enters the Iris context.  Instead of

    iPoseProof (pai_02 with "Htext") as "Hi02".        (* ...40 lines earlier *)
    iApply (wp_csdsp_s_sconf ... with "Hcg Hpc Hi02 Hr40").

write

    iApply (wp_csdsp_s_sconf ... with "Hcg Hpc [] Hr40").
    { iApply (pai_02 with "Htext"). }

RULE ONE says the cost of a proofmode step is |Delta|, so deleting a block of
sixty persistent facts discounts every one of the file's ~1700 steps.  Measured
on ProofPipealloc.v: wall -46%, Qed -61%, proof term -69%.

The hypothesis-name -> lemma-name map is READ OFF THE POSE LINES, so no
per-file prefix has to be guessed.

Usage:
    tools/instr_subgoal.py --check iris/ProofBmap.v      # report, touch nothing
    tools/instr_subgoal.py        iris/ProofBmap.v       # convert in place

--check exits 0 if the file converts outright, 1 if some reference to a posed
name is not a conforming call site (those need hand work; the converter refuses
to run rather than delete a pose whose fact is still needed).

        over 84 lemmas, -4.8%).

    Both columns are printed; sort key is poses-per-Qed, with peak live block
    breaking ties.  Neither sizes the win to better than about +/-10 points --
    ProofSysLink has the largest block in the tree and returned -14% because

"""board.py -- the REAL HARDWARE side of a device-semantics test.

The sibling of vtest.py.  Same question, different machine:

    is what the real hardware did an execution our model ALLOWS?

vtest.py asks it of QEMU; this asks it of a development board over JTAG.
Everything downstream is unchanged -- the test sources in tests/, the ABI in
abi.h, the model side in vtest-rocq/ -- because the only thing that differs
is how an image is loaded, started and read back.  A run produces
vtest-rocq/JH7110/<Name>Gen.v beside vtest.py's vtest-rocq/QEMU/<Name>Gen.v;
the platform is the DIRECTORY, and each carries its own run and proof.

  board.py profiles                 the board profiles it knows
  board.py probe                    talk to the board, print what is there
  board.py build  <name>...         assemble/link for the board only
  board.py run    <name>...         build + run on the board, print the result
  board.py gen    <name>...         build + run + write JH7110/<Name>Gen.v
  board.py gen --all

READ tools/vtest/README-hw.md FIRST.  It carries what a board run does and
does not claim, which is a narrower thing than what a QEMU run claims, and
the reasons are not obvious.


HOW A RUN WORKS, and why it is shaped like this
-----------------------------------------------

There is no `-kernel` and no QMP.  What there is:

  1. a GDB server (OpenOCD, port 3333) that can write memory in bulk and set
     registers, and
  2. an OpenOCD command server (telnet, port 4444) that can halt and resume.

so a run is: halt, write the image and the zero-filled regions, establish a
DEFINED register state on the harts the test uses, resume, poll the DONE
flag, halt, read the result region back.

Three things about that are worth knowing before changing any of it.

BULK, ALWAYS.  Every memory access over JTAG is a round trip.  gdb's
`restore <file> binary <addr>` writes a whole region in one go (measured: a
140-byte image plus two zeroed 4 KB regions in 1.6 s); a gdb `while` loop
writing the same 8 KB one doubleword at a time did not finish in two
minutes.  Nothing here may write memory a word at a time.

OPENOCD IS NOT IN OUR FILESYSTEM.  It may be a different container or a
different host, so `load_image` and `dump_image` -- which open files on
OpenOCD's side -- cannot be used at all.  Every byte moves over the GDB
remote protocol, which is why loading and reading back both go through gdb
and only run control goes over telnet.

HALT AND RESUME ARE SMP-WIDE.  On the VisionFive 2 the five harts are one
OpenOCD SMP group: `halt` halts all five and `resume` resumes all five, no
matter which target is selected.  So "run the test on one hart and leave the
rest alone" is not available; what IS available is to leave the harts we do
not use pointing where firmware left them, so they resume into their own
park loops.  See PROFILE["spare_harts"] and the --takeover flag.

    """A PERSISTENT gdb session, and it is the whole performance story.

    THE BOTTLENECK IS NOT THE GUEST.  A vtest image runs on the board in
    about 70 ms.  The first version of this runner took ~25 SECONDS per
    test, i.e. the measurement was 0.3% of the cost, and all of the rest was
    scaffolding:

      - THREE gdb PROCESS SPAWNS per run (discover the hart map, load and
        set up, read the result back).  Each is a process start plus a fresh
        connection to OpenOCD and a detach.
      - ~50 register writes PER HART, each one a separate JTAG transaction
        over the GDB remote protocol.
      - a POLLING LOOP on the DONE word over the OpenOCD telnet port, one
        round trip per poll, which also cannot tell "not finished yet" from
        "hung".

    This class removes the first and the third.  One gdb process is started
    per Board and lives for the whole batch, so a `gen --all` pays the
    startup once instead of three times per test; and instead of polling,
    the runner puts a HARDWARE BREAKPOINT on `_vtest_done` -- the instruction
    the primary parks at, which vtest.S exports as a symbol for exactly this
    -- and just continues.  That is one round trip for the whole run and it
    is exact: the breakpoint hits when the program has finished, and a
    timeout means it genuinely did not.

    Commands are framed by an `echo` sentinel, for the same reason the

    full of them.  The problem is the FETCH WINDOW: the model sometimes
    fetches FOUR bytes for what turns out to be a two-byte instruction, and
    its memory is a finite gmap holding precisely the image bytes.  So a
    compressed instruction in the LAST two bytes of an image has its fetch
    reach two bytes past the end, find nothing there, and the machine is
    STUCK at an address that disassembles to something perfectly ordinary.

    The QEMU images never hit this because they are built -march=rv64imafd
    and contain no compressed instructions at all, so every image ends on a
    4-byte instruction whose own fetch exactly covers it.  A board image is

    compresses freely, and core_smoke's final `ret` came out as a two-byte

    WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT.  On QEMU every run starts from a machine that
    has just been reset, and vtest-rocq/VTest.v starts the model from
    [ColdBoot.cold_regs] -- the model's OWN reset chain.  The two agree
    because both are power-on states, and core_regs_* is the evidence.

    A BOARD DOES NOT GIVE US THAT.  OpenOCD's `reset halt` on this rig
    re-initialises the JTAG TAP and halts, but does not reset the cores:
    measured 2026-08-29, mtvec still held OpenSBI's 0x40000410 and mepc /
    mcause still held firmware's values afterwards (reset_config is
    trst_only -- there is no SRST line, and ndmreset did not reach the
    harts).  So the harts start wherever firmware left them.

    What this function does is therefore an HONEST SECOND BEST: it writes
    the architectural state a test program can actually observe, so a run
    starts from a defined place rather than from a firmware-dependent one.
    What it does NOT do is make that place power-on.

    THE CONSEQUENCE, and it is the one real limitation of this rig: a
    core_regs_* test on this board measures the CSRs THIS FUNCTION WROTE,
    not the CSRs the hardware powers up with, so for the registers listed
    below such a test is vacuous.  README-hw.md says which those are.  It is
    NOT vacuous for anything else -- misa, the counters, the PMP file, and
    every register a test writes itself are all still real observations."""

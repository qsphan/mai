# run module built from it and that run's proof are all ABOUT one platform,
# so they go under that platform's directory.  What is SHARED stays at the
# top -- the harness (V*.v) and the hand-written interleavings (<Case>Sched.v,
# which both platforms' run modules Require).  Otherwise the top level is
# three hundred generated files and the eleven that matter cannot be found.
#
# THE PLATFORM IS THE DIRECTORY AND NOT THE NAME.  QEMU/CoreSmokeRun.v, not
# CoreSmokeQemuRun.v: saying it twice is what made the listing unreadable.
# So every path helper takes the platform as an ARGUMENT -- it can no longer
# be recovered from a file name, and nothing should try.
#
# Rocq needs only that a Require be qualified where the same name exists on
# both platforms: [-R . VTest] maps the directories to [VTest.QEMU.*] and
# [VTest.JH7110.*], and the generated files say [From VTest.QEMU Require
# Import CoreSmokeRun].  The capture's own DEFINITIONS keep their _hw_
# infix on the board side, so the two platforms' globals stay distinct even
# though their files are now both <Case>Test.v.

    Which Pass modules to list comes from one of two places:

      * by default, the ones ALREADY listed -- so regenerating after adding

        `make vtest-try` leaves behind.  That is how a newly-passing run
        gets ADDED, and how one that stopped passing gets removed.

    Everything else -- which runs exist at all -- is read off the tree.

    THERE IS NO LEGACY TIER.  Every case is expressed as a run through a
    VRun builder; what a per-case <Name>.v used to say about a capture, its

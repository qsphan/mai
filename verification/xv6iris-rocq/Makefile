# ======================================================================
# Top-level build for the xv6-on-Sail RISC-V Rocq/Iris development.
#
#   make            build everything needed for the proofs (== make proofs)
#   make proofs     compile the Iris proofs (iris/) + their dependencies
#   make vtest      regenerate the QEMU captures, then check the model
#                   against them (needs qemu-system-riscv64 + the toolchain)
#   make vtest-check  check the model against the CHECKED-IN captures only
#   make vtest-check-ci  the same, but compile every test and report the
#                   per-test result (what CI runs)
#   make vtest-deps build just the ~14 iris/ files vtest needs (not all of iris)
#   make hwtest     regenerate the captures from a REAL BOARD over JTAG, then
#                   check the model against them (needs the board + OpenOCD;
#                   read tools/vtest/README-hw.md first)
#   make hwtest-probe  talk to the board and print what is there
#   make vtest-table   THE TABLE: every case, its runs on QEMU and the
#                   board, and whether each run has a passing proof
#   make vtest-passes  build every run's proof, then print the table
#   make toolchain-check  is $(SWITCH) exactly opam/xv6rocq.export? (tools/toolchain_check.sh)
#   make audit      build, then Print Assumptions on the system theorem
#   make audit-only the same audit, against an already-built tree
#   make audit-tree / audit-tree-only  the same, for the TREE APPLICATION's
#                   era-0 obligation -- a cone neither of the other two walks
#   make audit-union / audit-union-only  the same, for THE APPLICATION theorem:
#                   the UNION of the file and pipeline lines, power-cycled --
#                   a cone the system audit never walks
#   make audit-all / audit-all-only    system + union application, concurrently
#   make model      compile the Sail-generated Coq model (model-xv6iris/)
#   make kernel     build the xv6 kernel ELF (xv6-riscv/kernel/kernel)
#   make user       build the xv6 user-space programs (xv6-riscv/user/_*)
#   make xv6-rev-check  warn if xv6-riscv/ is not at the pinned $(XV6_REV)
#   make dump       (re)generate kernel-rocq/*.v + user-rocq/*.v, then compile
#   make gen-code   regenerate the KERNEL decode layer (iris/Code*.v) from the dump
#   make check-decode  ... and fail if anything moved
#   make gen-ucode  regenerate the USER code catalogs (iris/UCode*.v); needs a
#                   built iris/, since it reads every AST off the model
#   make check-ucode   ... and fail if anything moved
#   make kernel-rocq  compile kernel-rocq/ (regenerating its .v if the ELF changed)
#   make user-rocq  compile user-rocq/ (the dumped user programs, e.g. _sync)
#   make dump-force force a re-dump of every image, even if the ELF is unchanged
#   make sail-rev-check  warn if sail-riscv/ is not at the pinned $(SAIL_RISCV_REV)
#   make model-gen  regenerate model-xv6iris/*.v from sail-riscv (needs `sail`)
#   make clean      remove Coq build artifacts (.vo/.glob/CoqMakefile)
#   make distclean  also `make clean` the xv6 tree
#
# Every Rocq command runs inside the project-local opam switch ($(SWITCH));
# you do NOT need to `eval $(opam env ...)` first.  Override on the command
# line if needed, e.g.  make OBJDUMP=riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump
#
# NOTE: regenerating the Coq model from the Sail sources needs the `sail`
# compiler (not required for a normal build -- the model .v are checked in).
# See README.md > "Build" > "Regenerating the Sail model".

# THE xv6 revision this development is proved against.  $(XV6_DIR) is
# .gitignored, so this is the only record of which upstream commit the tracked
# kernel-rocq/*.v came from -- building any other revision moves symbol
# addresses out from under every proof that names one (a few commits either
# way already move most of them).  Verified: a kernel built here reproduces
# kernel-rocq/*.v byte for byte and symbol for symbol.
#
# THE PIN IS A CLEAN TIP OF $(XV6_URL)'s `verified` BRANCH.  It was briefly a
# local cherry-pick (ae96fd0 + 9da28f5) while the fix for kernel-defects.md D2
# was ahead of the revision this tree was proved against; converging on the
# branch tip retired that apparatus, and the pin has tracked the tip since
# (…; d80e61c5: tx_lock becomes a spinlock, panic path removed; a28e94b: no
# procdump from the console; 2691300 -> 1a70c2e: unreachable() split out of
# panic(), rebased onto upstream 13602eb, which gives sleep() a prototype and
# so rewrites sys_sync's call to it; 1a70c2e -> 515391a: seventeen more
# panic() call sites become unreachable(), and gcc reorders four of fs.c's
# functions; 4398009 -> 4aab0eb: deterministic builds (-ffile-prefix-map, so
# every binary and fs.img is byte-identical across build trees -- what the
# literal rocq-raw dumps depend on) plus a new usertests binary
# (linkoverflow); no kernel/user layout change, all 20 dumps byte-identical;
# 45071c7 -> ded23f2: fix pid wraparound/reuse -- allocpid becomes a static
# retry scan over proc[] under pid_lock and gcc INLINES it into allocproc
# (the <allocpid> symbol is gone), freeproc takes pid_lock around p->pid = 0,
# everything after proc.c's allocproc moves +0x34, .eh_frame shrinks so
# every .data/.bss symbol moves -0x30; fs.img and the user dumps unchanged;
# ded23f2 -> 06ea57f: no console output on panic -- panic()'s two printk
# calls are COMMENTED OUT, so panic goes 40 bytes -> 10 (gcc keeps the now
# dead frame under -fno-omit-frame-pointer), .text shrinks and everything
# after panic moves -0x1e (the plic/virtio/kernelvec tail -0x20, an
# alignment boundary absorbing two more), the literals "panic: " and "%s\n"
# leave .rodata so every string at or above 0x80007018 moves -0x10 -- etext
# itself does NOT move, being page-aligned -- and .data/.bss move -0x10;
# panic is the ONLY function whose shape changed, every other diff is an
# immediate; fs.img and the user dumps unchanged; a8957838 -> 3e9926e: grep
# skips a line too long for its buffer instead of stopping at it -- user/
# grep.c only, the kernel dumps unchanged, the grep dumps and fs.img move).
# 3e9926e -> 7b2c1b1: seccomp -- struct proc gains uint64 seccomp (368 B; every
# .bss symbol after proc moves), syscall() gains the mask-check arm,
# sys_seccomp is entry 23, userinit/kfork store the mask, user/seccomp.c is a
# new binary (inum 23; its mask clears open, kill, link, unlink, mkdir, mknod)
# and every user ELF gains the seccomp stub (+8 after usys).
# Nothing here is a local commit:
# `git -C xv6-riscv checkout --detach $(XV6_REV)` reproduces the image, and
# that is the whole recipe.
#
# THAT BRANCH IS REBASED, NOT APPENDED TO, so `git -C xv6-riscv fetch` on a
# tree pinned at the previous tip reports a FORCED UPDATE and the old pin
# stays reachable only from your local clone -- expect the diff between two
# consecutive pins to be an upstream commit that landed UNDER the series, not
# on top of it.

# targets and linker relaxation.  (The pc's themselves are symbol-relative,
# [KernelSyms.bpin + 0x14], and survive a relayout untouched.)
#
# So the whole layer -- iris/KernelDecode*.v and every iris/Code*.v named in

#   make gen-code        regenerate the decode layer from the tracked dump

# costs alone (claude-notes/optimization.md has the dated measurement).
#
# `--output-sync=target` is not tidiness either: the two Print Assumptions
# outputs land on one stdout, and without it they interleave mid-line and both
# lists become unreadable.  -O makes make buffer each recipe and emit it whole.
# (CI does not use this target -- it backgrounds the two `audit-*-only` targets
# itself, because it needs each audit's output in a log file of its own to put
# in the step summary.  Same parallelism, different plumbing.)

# ---- 5. vtest: the device semantics, differentially tested against QEMU ----
#
# These are NOT proofs.  The question they answer is one-directional -- is
# what the real hardware did an execution our model ALLOWS? -- so a test only
# has to EXHIBIT one model execution matching what QEMU produced, which is a
# computation (a [vm_cast_no_check]d equation), not a WP.  See
# tools/vtest/README.md and vtest-rocq/VTest.v.
#
# TWO TARGETS, and the split matters.  `vtest-gen` RE-RUNS QEMU and rewrites
# the captured vtest-rocq/QEMU/*Gen.v; it needs qemu-system-riscv64 and the
# toolchain.  `vtest-check` only checks the model against the captures already
# checked in, so CI (and anyone without QEMU) can run it.  Neither is part of
# `make proofs`: a red device test is a finding about the model, and it must
# not break the proof build.
VTEST := vtest-rocq

# THE CONE vtest ACTUALLY NEEDS -- [RiscvExec] + [DevModel] + [ColdBoot] and
# their dependencies, fourteen files, NOT all of iris/.  There is no CSL in
# vtest-rocq: a test exhibits one execution by computation, so it needs the
# model and the interpreter and nothing above them.  `vtest-deps` builds
# exactly that (~2 min from cold), which is what keeps a device test from
# ever being blocked by in-progress proof work elsewhere in the tree.
#
# It drives the sub-CoqMakefiles DIRECTLY rather than going through the
# `kernel-rocq` target, whose prerequisites reach the kernel ELF: the dumped
# .v are checked in, and vtest has no business rebuilding an image.

# ---- 5b. hwtest: the same semantics, against a REAL BOARD over JTAG ----

# tools/vtest/board.py is vtest.py's sibling: it asks the same
# one-directional question of a development board (currently a StarFive
# VisionFive 2) instead of QEMU, and writes vtest-rocq/JH7110/<Name>Gen.v
# beside vtest.py's vtest-rocq/QEMU/<Name>Gen.v.  Each carries its own run
# module and proof; the platform is the DIRECTORY.  There is no separate
# check target: a board capture is checked by `vtest-check` like every
# other one.
#
# READ tools/vtest/README-hw.md BEFORE USING THESE.  A board run claims
# something NARROWER than a QEMU run -- the image is not the same image, the
# board's power-on register file is not reachable over JTAG, and the UART is
# a different chip at a different stride -- and the reasons are not obvious.
#
# `hwtest-gen` needs the board attached and OpenOCD listening (gdb on 3333,
# the command server on 4444); nothing else here does.  It is deliberately
# NOT wired into `vtest`, which must keep working with no hardware present.

# (cv64a6_imafdc_sv39, inside CVA6's own corev_apu testharness), simulated
# by Verilator, writing vtest-rocq/CVA6/<Name>{Test,Run}.v.  The image is
# byte-for-byte QEMU's, and the simulator starts from a real reset.  See the
# docstring of tools/vtest/cva6.py and README.md "The third platform".
#
# THE SIMULATOR LIVES ON THE BUILD VM.  Run the scripts there directly, not
# through a remote top-level make (remote-build-gcp.md says why):
#   ./gcp-rocq/run-on-gcp tools/vtest/cva6/build.py          (once per pin)
#   ./gcp-rocq/run-on-gcp tools/vtest/cva6.py gen --all -k
#   ./gcp-rocq/run-on-gcp --no-sync --pull vtest-rocq/CVA6/ true
# These two targets are the same commands, for a machine that has Verilator.

# WHAT CI RUNS, and it is `vtest-check` with the stopping rule moved.  Every
# test must pass, here as there; what differs is that `-k` compiles them all
# rather than stopping at the first red one, make's own status is DISCARDED
# (the leading `-`), and `vtest.py table --check` -- THE run table, the same
# one `make vtest-table` prints -- is what fails the target.
#
# THE TABLE IS THE REPORT, and there is no second one.  A run is listed in
# _CoqProject exactly when its proof holds, and the table reads the .vo those
# listings produced; so "did the build go green" and "what does the table say"
# are answered by the same artefacts and cannot disagree.  The log is still
# written, for a human reading WHY a red one is red.
#
# There is no list of expected-red tests, and none is wanted: a KNOWN
# divergence from the hardware is pinned on BOTH sides and proved unequal (see
# tools/vtest/README.md, "Recording a divergence"), which is green today and
# goes red the day the model moves.  So every red test is news.
#
# IT DELETES THE .vo FIRST -- IN EVERY PLATFORM DIRECTORY, which a top-level
# `rm $(VTEST)/*.vo` did not do once the runs moved into QEMU/, JH7110/ and
# CVA6/, leaving every run's proof unprotected -- and that is not tidiness -- it is what makes the
# report's "this test passed" mean anything.  The report reads the filesystem,
# and a FAILED recompile LEAVES THE PREVIOUS .vo IN PLACE: coq_makefile's
# .DELETE_ON_ERROR removes the .glob (which coqc had begun) but not a .vo that
# this run never touched, so on a warm tree -- a self-hosted CI runner keeps
# the gitignored artifacts between runs -- a newly red test would be reported
# green off last run's output.  Measured: 117 files, ~600 s of CPU, longest
# single file 33 s, so a clean re-check is one file's wall-clock wide on a
# many-core machine and cheap next to the iris build it follows.  Anything
# outside $(VTEST) (the iris/ cone, the kernel dump) is untouched and still
# incremental.
#
# The log is piped through tee only so the report can quote each failure's
# error text; `*.log` is gitignored.  Nothing here runs QEMU -- the captures

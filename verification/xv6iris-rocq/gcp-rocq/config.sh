# installs from a package repository here. It only points OPAMROOT at this
# root (see wire_opam_env in provision-gcp.sh) so `opam exec --switch=...`
# in the Makefile has an opam state to run against; the root itself has to
# already know about that switch, which is true whenever the data disk is a
# clone of one that was set up that way.

# every login shell, so a remote `make -C iris -f CoqMakefile` finds `rocq`
# without an `opam exec --switch=...` wrapper. Without that, the sub-make form
# does not fail: coqdep silently produces nothing, make prints "Nothing to be
# done" and exits 0 -- a green-looking no-op. Leave empty to wire only OPAMROOT.

# ---- the safe build ----------------------------------------------------
# `run-on-gcp --proofs` runs this, and it is the only build form that is safe
# on the VM. A top-level `make` reaches the dump rules, which regenerate the
# tracked kernel-rocq/user-rocq sources from whatever ELF the VM happens to
# have -- clobbering the image the sync just pushed, with the damage surfacing
# far away as a bogus address failure. Driving each sub-tree through its own
# generated CoqMakefile never reaches a dump rule at all.

TREES_DIR="${ROCQ_TREES_DIR:-$DATA_MOUNT/trees}"

# Compare file *contents* rather than mtimes when deciding what to send.
# Paired with --no-times in run-on-gcp, this is what keeps incremental make
# correct: transferred files get the VM's write time (so make rebuilds them),
# untransferred files keep their old timestamps (so make skips them), and the
# local clock never enters into it. Turning this off is faster on very large
# trees but reintroduces the backwards-mtime failure mode described there.

/* abi.h -- THE TEST ABI, shared by the .S sources, tools/vtest/vtest.py and
   vtest-rocq/VTest.v.  Any change here must be made in all three.

   A vtest program is a bare-metal M-mode image.  It runs on QEMU and, byte
   for byte the same image, on the Rocq semantics; the two are compared on
   what the program left in the RESULT region and on what it did to the disk.

   THE REGION LIST IS LOAD-BEARING, not bookkeeping.  The Rocq machine's
   memory is a FINITE gmap, so a load or store outside a declared region is
   STUCK -- the model has no transition and the test fails loudly.  That is
   deliberate: on QEMU such an access would silently read the zero the
   machine happens to have there, and the difference would go unnoticed.  A
   program that wants memory must have it declared here. */

   were.  A BOARD PROFILE (tools/vtest/board.py, currently the VisionFive 2)
   overrides them, so one .S source builds for both machines.

   THIS IS A DEPARTURE FROM "one binary runs on both machines", and it is
   not a small one -- see tools/vtest/README-hw.md, "What a board image is
   allowed to differ in".  The short version: a capture carries its own
   [<name>_text], so two machines running two images is still two honest
   one-directional claims; what it costs is that a divergence can no longer
   be blamed on the machine alone, and every macro below is therefore a
   place a finding could hide.  Keep the list short and keep it here.

 * The PLIC's enable bitmaps and threshold/claim pairs are PER CONTEXT, not
 * per hart, and the context NUMBERING depends on the platform's hart
 * layout.  A test that hardcodes hart 0's is only correct on hart 0.
 *
 *   QEMU virt   every hart has an M and an S context, in that order, so
 *               hart h owns contexts 2h (M) and 2h+1 (S).  Hart 0's S
 *               context is 1 -- which is what these tests used to hardcode.
 *
 *   JH7110      hart 0 is the E24, which is M-MODE ONLY and takes context 0
 *               by itself; the four U74s follow, so U74 hart h owns
 *               contexts 2h-1 (M) and 2h (S).  Our primary is hart 2, whose
 *               S context is 4.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is silent: the enable and the claim land on ANOTHER
 * hart's context (on this board, context 1 is the firmware hart's M
 * context), our hart never sees the interrupt, and the test spins until the
 * runner times it out.  That is why every plic_ case that drives an
 * interrupt through a context was uncapturable on the board. */

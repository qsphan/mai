**THE OP-WIDE LOG LEDGER OF sys_link, ARM BY ARM, MACHINE CHECKED AT EVERY
CORNER OF THE REPORTED BOOLEANS.**  A port of Rocq `SysLinkBudget.v`
(`iris/SysLinkBudget.v`, 228 lines), WHOLE.  Pure.

CONSUMERS (grep, brief fs7b §5.1): Rocq `ProofSysLink.v` (`sl_iu`,
`sl_u0..u3f`, `sl_corr`, the arm theorems), `ProofSysLinkTails.v`
(`sl_orphan_closes`), `LinkSysLink.v` / `SpecDirlink.v` /
`SpecSysUnlink.v` (the refutations and the corner, cited in their headers).
So it is ported whole.

Rocq's header, kept because the reasons are the content:

> sys_link's transaction is
>
>   begin_op                              ten units, empty set
>   namei(old)          success           `wp_namei_gen`
>   ip->nlink++; iupdate(ip)              `wp_iupdate_link`
>   iunlock(ip)                           nothing logged
>   nameiparent(new, name)                `wp_nameiparent_gen`

> THE CORRELATION CLAUSE.  Neither walk takes a bitmap credit, so both may

## Deviations from Rocq

1. As `Xv6/SysUnlinkBudget.lean` deviation 1, plus `dirlink_units`/
   `dl_need` are `SpecDirlink.dirlinkUnits`/`dlNeed`.
2. Names: `sl_iu` → `slIu`, `sl_u0/u1/u2/u3/u3f` → `slU0/U1/U2/U3/U3f`, and
   the theorems camel-headed with Rocq's snake tail (`sl_corr` → `slCorr`,
   `sl_bad1_closes` → `slBad1_closes`, `sl_orphan_closes` →
   `slOrphan_closes`, `sl_found_counted_busts_by_one` →
   `slFound_counted_busts_by_one`, ...).

/-- ARM E2, THE ORPHAN GUARD (Rocq's `sl_orphan_closes`): nothing has been

/-! ## 4.  ARM F-FOUND, and the contract it decided

`link(old, new)` with `new` ALREADY PRESENT makes `dirlink`'s `dirlookup`
match, so it `iput`s the child and returns -1 without writing anything.
sys_link cannot refute that arm the way create does, so it has to be PAID
FOR, by SpecDirlink's SEPARATE found-arm clause `found = true → ncount -
iputUnits ≤ n'`. -/

against the counted `dirlinkUnits = 7` alone the arm is unpayable at every
corner. -/

/-- ...and THREE is the largest constant that would have worked: FOUR busts
again (Rocq's `sl_found_at_four_busts`). -/

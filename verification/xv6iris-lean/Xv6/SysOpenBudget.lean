**THE OP-WIDE LOG LEDGER OF sys_open, ARM BY ARM** (pure).  A port of Rocq
`SysOpenBudget.v` (`iris/SysOpenBudget.v`, 268 lines),
stated at the figures the LANDED Lean contracts state: `MAXOPBLOCKS`
(LogDefs), `walkNeed` / `walkSpend` (SpecNamex), `iputUnits` / `ipSpendW`
(SpecIput), `itEntry` / `itBm` / `itIu` / `itSpend` (SpecItrunc).

Rocq's header, kept (the reasons are the content):

> The whole ledger turns on ONE figure: what the two entry arms leave at the
> JOIN.  The namei arm leaves NINE (ten less at most one walk unit); the
> create arm leaves only what `SpecCreate`'s `ok = true` floor promises,
> which is `iput_units` -- THREE.  So the joint invariant past +0x4a is
> `iput_units <= u`, and every one of the four failure arms below the join
> spends exactly `iput_units` on its `iunlockput`.  That is EXACT:
> `so_join_exact`.

(Addresses in Rocq's arm map are Rocq's image; the Lean image's `sys_open`
is at `KA.«sys_open»` and its join is the `lh a4,68(s1)` at +0x4a.)

## The create lemmas

`so_create_need`, `so_create_need_exact` and `so_create_arm_closes` read
`SpecCreate.create_units` (= `MAXOPBLOCKS`), which the Lean port hoists to
`CreateDefs.createUnits` (split of SpecCreate.v, D21); this file imports
`CreateDefs` for it (Rocq imports SpecCreate).

## Deviations from Rocq

1. `S u` / `S (S u)` are `u + 1` / `u + 2` (the port's spelling); every
   quantity is `Nat`, as in Rocq.
2. Names: `so_u0` → `soU0`, `so_un` → `soUn`, `so_unf` → `soUnf`, `so_join`
   → `soJoin`; lemma names camel head, Rocq snake tail (`so_namei_need` →
   `soNamei_need`, ...).

## Dropped/simplified vs Rocq

Nothing.

/-! ## 2.  The two entry arms, down to the join -/

/-- create's premise is EXACTLY begin_op's mint, with nothing to spare
(Rocq's `so_create_need`): the O_CREATE arm is only callable because
sys_open does no logging of its own before it. -/

components. -/

/-- ...and at TWO components the counted SPEND leaves one where the join's
`iunlockput` needs three (Rocq's `so_counted_namei_busts_at_two`). -/

theorem soJoin_exact : soJoin = iputUnits := rfl

/-- WITHOUT THE FLOOR (Rocq's `so_create_nofloor_busts`, stated as the
corner): the ceiling admits `u' = 0`, and three is not at most zero. -/

/-! ## 4.  The four failure arms below the join -/

theorem soArmD_closes : iputUnits ≤ soJoin := by decide

/-- THE SPEND IS NOT THE ENTRY BOUND (Rocq's `so_arms_DEF_survivors`) -/
theorem soArms_DEF_survivors (w : Bool) : soJoin - ipSpendW w false false ≤ 2 := by

/-! ## 5.  The success tail: O_TRUNC -/

/-- itrunc's UNCREDITED entry level at the create corner: two of three
(Rocq's `so_trunc_need`). -/
theorem soTrunc_need : itEntry false (soJoin - 2) ≤ soJoin := by decide

gained, one unit (Rocq's `so_trunc_credit_would_gain`). -/

/-! ## 6.  The whole ledger, per entry arm -/

/-- THE O_CREATE ARM, end to end (Rocq's `so_create_arm_closes`): create is
callable, its floor meets the join, every failure arm's `iunlockput` is
callable, and the O_TRUNC tail's entry level is met. -/

**THE LOG BUDGET'S AMORTISED LEDGER**, ported from section 6
(`Section LogAmort`) of `iris/WriteiBudget.v`.

**SCOPE: THE `logAmort` FAMILY AND NOTHING ELSE.**  `WriteiBudget.v` has
eleven sections; ten of them (`FW_MAX`, `wi_cost*`, `bm_iter_cost`,
`bm_pot`, `wi_inv_bud` / `wi_inv_spent` / `wi_step_alloc` / `wi_inv_exit`,
`wi_fset`, `wi_logset`, `wi_ad_of_alloced`) are stated over
`SpecWritei.wi_blocks`, `SpecBmap.bmap_cost`, `BitmapInv.bitmap_geom_ok`
and `InodeInv.blkmap`, none of which this port has yet, so they land with
`writei` (wave 5).  Section 6 needs NOTHING but the log's own ledger
fragment, which is already here (`Xv6.logOpS`, `logOpb`, `logOpS_opb`,
`logOpS_timeless` in `Xv6/LogInv.lean`), so it lands now.  `log_amort` /
`wi_amort` are referenced by no other Rocq file -- they are the parked
"two-credit day" machinery -- so nothing downstream waits on this.

**WHAT IT IS FOR.**  "`u` units are genuinely free, and one unit is still
held back for each block of `F` this op has not yet logged."  `v` is the
op's real remaining budget and `Sb` its real already-logged set; both are
existential, because no caller can know either.  The potential
`u + unpaid F Sb` is what stays put across a `log_write` of a block of
`F`, which is what makes a loop invariant possible.

**IDEMPOTENCE, AND WHERE IT IS CASHED.**  `logAmort_present` is
IDEMPOTENT -- `u` is the same going in and coming out, whichever arm of the
write runs -- and that is the whole point of the amortisation: with every
`log_write` spending a unit, `itrunc`'s 269 `bfree`s would cost 269
against `MAXOPBLOCKS = 10`.  It is cashed by `log_write`'s CREDITED arm:
`Xv6.LOG_WRITE.wp_log_write_gen` takes exactly the
`⌜cr = true → b ∈ Sb⌝ ∗ logOpS γ (v + 1) Sb` this lemma hands out and
returns the `logOpS γ (if cr then v + 1 else v) (b :: Sb)` its wand takes
back; the atomic-update form `wp_log_write_au` does the same at the
epoch-named entry (`Xv6.logOpS_named`, `Xv6.logCredit_own`,
`Xv6.logOpSwe_opSe`, `Xv6.logOpSe_opS`).

**DEVIATIONS from Rocq, all forced by the port's standing `gset Z` →
`List Nat` deviation (`Xv6/LogDefs.lean`).**

1. **THE POTENTIAL COUNTS UNPAID MEMBERS, NOT A SET DIFFERENCE'S
   CARDINALITY.**  Rocq's `log_amort` uses `size (F ∖ Sb)`.  Here
   `Sb : List Nat` is NOT deduplicated -- `Xv6.logSpendStep` and
   `logRecordStep` both produce `b :: Sb` unconditionally -- so
   `unpaid F Sb` counts the members of `F` that are not in `Sb`, which is
   well defined for a duplicated `Sb` and agrees with Rocq's whenever `F`
   is duplicate-free (which every call site's `F` is: `[bmapstart, ind]`).
2. **`logAmort_intro` TAKES `u + F.length ≤ v`** where Rocq takes
   `u + size F ≤ v`.  `size F ≤ length F` for a list-as-set, so this is a
   STRONGER premise and the lemma is weaker; `wiAmort_intro`, the only
   consumer, supplies `2 = [bms, ind].length` either way.
3. **`logAmort_shrink` TAKES `F'.Sublist F`** where Rocq takes `F' ⊆ F`.
   With bare membership the cardinality claim is FALSE (`F'` may duplicate
   a member of `F`), and every call site -- writei's loop drops the
   indirect block from `[bmapstart, ind]` -- supplies a sublist.
4. **`Sb ∪ {[b]}` IS `b :: Sb`** and `{[x]} ∪ F` is `x :: F`, which is
   exactly what the ledger's own steps produce; **`Sb ⊆ Sb'` is
   `∀ x ∈ Sb, x ∈ Sb'`**, the shape `logOpSw`'s consumers already use.
5. `S u` is `u + 1` and `S (S u)` is `u + 2`, the port's arithmetic
   spelling.
